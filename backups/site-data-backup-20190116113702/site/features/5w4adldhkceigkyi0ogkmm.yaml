:summary: Redis and Memcached support for caching management
:desc: 'In addition to Database services, Datica also manages implementations of Caches
  with Redis and Memcached. Whether youâ€™re relying on session caching, or need a pub-sub
  solution, Datica provides the tooling to allow you to maintain control in a secure
  and compliant manner. Customers can elect to deploy containers with Redis or Memcache
  and scale RAM as needed. Note: We recommend Redis is best used as a caching tool
  and not an HA database replacement. For database options, consider our native support
  for Postgres, MySQL, or Mongo. We also provide additional database options through
  custom services.'
