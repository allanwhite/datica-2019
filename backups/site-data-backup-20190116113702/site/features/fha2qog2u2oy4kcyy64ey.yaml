:summary: Centralized logging through an ELK stack
:desc: Datica provides a complete ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack
  for logging. With Elasticsearch and Logstash working behind the scenes to log system-level
  activity, users can ship additional application-level logs to their central logging
  container. All logs are exposed via the Kibana dashboard that sits alongside your
  Platform environment. Before shipping any of your application logs, the Datica ELK
  stack comes pre-configured with important information about your infrastructure
  that map to compliance requirements.
