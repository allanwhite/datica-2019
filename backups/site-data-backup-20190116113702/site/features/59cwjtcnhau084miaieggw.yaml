:summary: HA environments for mission-critical products
:desc: Datica customers run mission-critical applications impacting patient lives.
  Being able to support the resiliency of those applications is inherit to the Platform.
  Our “Service Proxy” service is responsible for routing traffic from the outside
  world to your environment. The service proxy can handle highly-available (“HA”)
  applications and will automatically load balance depending on the traffic situation.
  Additionally, the Platform supports highly-available services all the way down the
  user’s critical path.
