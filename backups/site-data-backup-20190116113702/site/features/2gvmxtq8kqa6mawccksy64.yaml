:summary: Deploying is as simple as `git push datica master`
:desc: We don’t expect every user and developer on the Platform to build their own
  Docker images. That’s why we’re dedicated to continuing support for our buildpack
  functionality. This allows users to simply run `git push` and the Platform takes
  care of the rest of the work for you. Support for all official buildpacks are standard
  on the Platform, while custom buildpacks are also possible and encouraged if necessary.
