:summary: Scale storage volumes on-the-fly
:desc: Database services on the Datica Platform come pre-shipped with attached storage
  devices (EBS volumes for those familiar with AWS nomenclature, or Page Blobs for
  those on Azure). While we donâ€™t give users the ability to scale database RAM on
  their own, we do give them complete control over storage.
