:desc: "Datica gives customers full control over creating new HIPAA compliant, GDPR
  compliant, GxP compliant, HITRUST certified environments. \n\nNo longer will you
  have to think about about capacity provisioning, standing up servers, or managing
  infrastructure, and then worry if it was done in a compliant way. Simply select
  the services you need to make your application run, and hit go.\n\nServices are
  what makes up a Datica environment. Some services are pre-shipped with each environment
  in order to maintain compliance controls, others are selected directly by users.
  Adding services to new and existing environments is as easy as clicking a button
  through our self-service functionality."
