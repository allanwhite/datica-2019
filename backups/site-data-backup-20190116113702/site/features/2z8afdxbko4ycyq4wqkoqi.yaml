:summary: One-click-installations of Mirth Connect for EHR integration
:desc: Mirth is an open source enterprise integration engine that we use to power
  EHR integrations for our customers. With more than 160 site-to-site integration
  projects across various health systems in the last three years, and millions of
  transactions processed per day, Mirth has proven it can handle the hardest and most
  mission-critical use cases. With Datica’s one-click installation of Mirth (OCI),
  customers can get started with EHR integration in literally the click of a button.
  We’ve also put extensive work into [open sourcing our Mirth transforms](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)
  so developers can start building even quicker. [View the open source project here.](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
