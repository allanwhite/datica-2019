:summary: Organization-level MFA policy management
:desc: We consider multi-factor authentication table stakes when it comes to managing
  online accounts. Datica’s multi-factor authentication feature not only gives individual
  account owners the ability to implement MFA for their account, but admins and organization
  owners the ability to mandate an MFA policy across their entire organization — with
  options for both email and Google Authenticator.
