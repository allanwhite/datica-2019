:summary: Complete control over an environment services configuration
:desc: Service files are one of the most used features across the entire Platform.
  With Service Files, users are able to customize the services that make up their
  environment(s). Some Service Files are created when the Service is created â€” others
  are created later. For example, every time a Site is added, a Service File is added
  to the Environment's Service Proxy to manage the NGINX configuration for the site.
  This gives users near full control over how each service is configured on the Platform.
