:summary: Bring your own Docker containers for maximum flexibility
:desc: The core compliance features on the Datica Platform have always ran on Docker
  containers. In addition to containerized compliance services, customers can push
  their own a Docker images directly to their Platform environments, skipping the
  buildpack and "git push" process entirely. There are many benefits to this alternative
  deployment model, but the one customer enjoy most is the predictability that exactly
  that Docker image will exactly on the Platform as it does anywhere else Docker is
  ran, including your localhost.
