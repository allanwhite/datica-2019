  :description: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling,
    and management of containerized applications.
  :body: "It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for
    easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of
    running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and
    practices from the community.\n\n"

  Kubernetes platform to manage healthcare compliance on top of AWS and Microsoft
  Azure.
