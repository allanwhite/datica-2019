  :summary: 'Makers of digital health products need to be ready for GDPR, which takes
    effect on May 25, 2018. This overview guides you through the basics of GDPR compliance,
    data breach notifications, and much more. '
  :featured_image:
    :id: 6LTxW4dsIwEcU6uaIOCUYw
  :lead: "## What is the GDPR?\nGDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation,
    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
    applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the
    academy article, [GDPR for Cloud Service Providers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)\n\n##
    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
    experts](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/) today to find out how you can be compliant
    with GDPR or drop us a line at [hello@datica.com](mailto:hello@datica.com).\n"
