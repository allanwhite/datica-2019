  :lead: In November, Datica launched [One-Click-Install Mirth Connect](https://datica.com/platform/integration),
    along with our new open source [Mirth Transforms](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms).

    The full announcement is available [here](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/).

    This is a shift in how we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health companies. You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance and security, but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. OCI Mirth Connect gets you there.

    In this session, Mark gave an overview of our history and a demonstration of how to set up Mirth on the Platform. The recording is available here:
