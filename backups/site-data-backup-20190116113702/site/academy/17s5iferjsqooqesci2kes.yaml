  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: The HIPAA Privacy Rule is important to understand because it explains the
  types of data, covered entities, and uses of data HIPAA is concerned about.
:post: |
  ## Overview
  The HIPAA [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/privacysummary.pdf) sets many of the terms used for HIPAA, outlines the types of entities that need to comply with HIPAA, defines appropriate uses or disclosures of health information, and also covers penalties for HIPAA violations. The Privacy Rule is important to understand, despite the fact that it doesn't include specific technical requirements or polices, as the Privacy Rule gives an understanding of the types of data, entities, and uses of data that HIPAA is concerned about.

  ## Entities
  The Privacy Rule defines two main categories of entities:

  1. *Covered Entities (CEs)*. These are the traditional players in healthcare - providers, hospitals, health systems, insurers. For some reason clearinghouses are called out as they transform and process health information for payers and providers; the clearinghouse that I always think of is Emdeon.

  2. *Business Associates (BAs)*. These are individuals and organizations that provide services and/or technology to covered entities. In the process of providing those services and technology, the business associate in some way process, transmit, or store protected health information (PHI). All software vendors in healthcare, if they somehow touch PHI, are business associates.

  A third category of entity or, maybe more accurately, a subcategory of business associates was added in 2013 as part of the HIPAA Omnibus rules in the HITECH Act. The HITECH Act defined a subcontractor as an entity that "creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of the business associate." A subcontractor is a business associate of a business associate. It can be a hosting provider, an email delivery service (email address), or even an analytics platform (IP address), if it in some way touches PHI. At Datica, many of our customers are business associates and we are subcontractors for them so we meet the new definition of subcontractor.

  The Omnibus Rule also defined a PHR vendor, offering a PHR through a covered entity as a business associate.

  ## PHI + De-identifying
  We devoted an entire post to "[What is PHI?](https://catalyze.io/learn/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi)" because it's an incredibly important topic in HIPAA. It's basically personally identifiable data (name, email, phone, etc) combined with some type of health-related data (medication, diagnosis, provider name).

  PHI can be de-identified by removing certain elements from the data, in a process called the [Safe Harbor](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#safeharborguidance) method, or through "[expert determination](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#guidancedetermination)", which seems a bit fuzzy to us as it is ripe for interpretation. The idea with both methods for de-identification is to make it so you can't identify an individual from a data set (duh!).

  ## Use or disclosing of PHI
  PHI can only be disclosed for reasons defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, or with written permission by an individual about their own health information. Other than providing access to the individual to his/her medical record, the Privacy Rule allows for disclosing PHI for three main reasons:

  1. *Treatment.* Probably the most obvious reason for disclosure, exchanging PHI between providers for treatment, management, and consultation happens all the time.
  2. *Payment.* In order to collect payments from insurers, disclosure of PHI is essential.
  3. *Operations.* We think of this as the catch-all bucket. It encompasses many administrative functions such as quality reporting and different types of operational analytics. This is also where disclosures for medical education fall in.

  There are some other, more obscure, reasons for disclosures. The most relevant reasons left are for legal reasons ("required by law"), worker compensation, and for restricted research purposes, amongst others.

  In some select cases – in particular, marketing – covered entities may disclose PHI but only with authorization from the individual.

  ## Minimum necessary
  One of the central tenants of HIPAA, as stated in the Privacy Rule, is minimum necessary use of PHI. The idea is relatively simple, don't disclose any information that is not necessary for the reason for which the information is to be used. For example, if you're trying to find out how much a patient owes for a particular procedure, you probably don't need to disclose that patient's allergies. In healthcare today, minimum necessary is usually observed by either specific HL7 or EDI X12 message types which confine the amount and type of data in a data exchange.

  ## Notice of HIPAA Privacy Policies
  Covered entities must provide individuals with a notice informing those individuals of their rights, as well as detailing other factors such as the protections the covered entity use to secure PHI. You probably remember getting and signing these every time you go to the doctor.

  ## Penalties
  The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), within HHS, is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA rules. In addition to civil (financial) penalties, there are criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing PHI or obtain PHI in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

  :summary: A risk assessment – a HIPAA requirement – is the first thing to do since
    it frames many decisions you'll make regarding your security posture.
  :post: |
    Probably the first thing to consider when going down the path of compliance, or really the first thing to think about regarding security holistically, is to perform a risk assessment. A risk assessment is a requirement of HIPAA and it's really the first thing that should be done. The reason it's so important is because it frames many of the rest of the decisions you make regarding your security posture.

    In the words of HHS - "Conducting a risk analysis is the first step in identifying and implementing safeguards that comply with and carry out the standards and implementation specifications in the Security Rule. Therefore, a risk analysis is foundational..."

    From the HIPAA Security Rule - "Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the organization."

    As part of the risk assessment you need to outline your core technology infrastructure. In that process you should do an inventory of all the systems that you manage. Then you need to map out which of those systems process, transmit, or store electronic protected health information (ePHI). For us that's the starting point for risk management strategy and a risk assessment.

    The next step in a thorough risk assessment is to assess the various threats and vulnerabilities to your environment, and ultimately to the integrity of ePHI. These can be anything from physical threats, like breaking into a data center or a fire or natural disaster in your data center, to malicious software, like hacking into a system, to internal malfeasance, like an employee going rogue and breaking into your systems. You need to map out all of the possible threats and vulnerabilities.

    For us, we map vulnerabilities specifically to HIPAA rules related to protection of ePHI. For each perceived vulnerability, we assess the likelihood and impact - with the product of those two factors producing the risk level. The impact is the potential of a risk leading to a PHI breach - or a loss of PHI - because there are issues around integrity of data in HIPAA. We also determine if that risk has been mitigated in some way by our current security posture and controls.

    Once you know the infrastructure, risks, and threats/vulnerabilities, the next step is to mitigate the risks that exist and have not been fully mitigated by current security controls. Not all risks can be 100% mitigated. There are typically gaps in almost all risk assessments because if you do a risk assessment you will get a ton of different variables - not just the obvious ones at the top of your head right now. And, from those risks, there typically are some gaps that need to be mitigated. It's imperative that you come up with a mitigation strategy. Ask yourself what you can do that is reasonable and appropriate to mitigate risks to ePHI. From there, you need to implement those mitigation strategies and documenting thoroughly. Documentation is not fun but has to be done in a compliant industry like healthcare.

    We follow all of the steps above using a spreadsheet with sheets for each step, and we do ours both annually and on an ongoing basis, when there are changes to our core infrastructure. We use NIST standards ([NIST800-30](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf) and [800-26](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/Draft-sp800-26Rev1.pdf)) as the model for our [risk assessment](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#security-management-process---164.308(a)(1)(i)) at Datica. We're more than happy to share the spreadsheets and the steps and processes that we use to do that. If you want to reach out to us we can help you with that process. But that really is the first step that you need to do because that helps you really understand where your major gaps are. And it also helps you understand which things you need to do to implement or mitigate the risk that you have within, and the threats that you have to your infrastructure and to PHI -  that you're storing a processing or whatever it might be for covered entity.

  :summary: 'Understanding the HIPAA breach policy and having a breach notification
    checklist can prepare you in case of unauthorized disclosure of ePHI. '
  :post: |
    One of the most important aspects of HIPAA has nothing to do with technical security like encryption, backup, logging, or any of other requirements for securing data. What's important is what happens in the case of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, or a breach of ePHI. A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure that's not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

    HITECH Act Sec. 13402(b) Notification of Covered Entity by Business Associate states - A business associate of a covered entity that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured protected health information shall, following the discovery of a breach of such information, notify the covered entity of such breach. Such notice shall include the identification of each individual whose unsecured protected health information has been, or is reasonably believed by the business associate to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach.

    The majority of breaches are actually not software breaches. They're not hacking into a system that causes the unauthorized disclosures. Breaches affecting over 500 records are [published](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html) by CMS. You can see there's a searchable database of breaches that have occurred, how many records were affected and the type of breach. The vast majority of breaches are hardware breaches. The majority, if not almost all of the breaches, seem to happen because of [employee carelessness](http://rockhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/34f9a961f56ac6d3013d8b1bd266ef3b96fee194.png). It seems like it's almost always a contractor's laptop, often at the VA, that's been unencrypted and has been storing tons of patient records. The laptop is stolen from a car or a house or a coffee shop or an airport or whatever.

    "Hacking/IT Incident" only accounts for 68 breaches, a relatively small number. There is great potential to have a breach with a malicious hacker breaking into a private network or any sort of cloud storage, especially public cloud. This potential has fueled much of the slow pace of moving ePHI to the cloud.

    There are ways to mitigate that risk – and that is why we created Datica – but the important thing when it comes to a breach is actually having a process in place that details the steps to take in case of a breach. How do you assess what information was exposed in an unauthorized way and then how do you go about notifying relevant parties of that breach? The necessary notifications include anybody from the actual patient whose medical record was exposed, to the media, covered entities, and business associates. The notification policy should lay out plans for forensics to discover the extent of the breach and the cause of the breach. There is typically a chain of command that is outlined in a breach notification strategy that lays out, in detail, who is responsible for different aspects of notification and mitigation. The rules also put the burden on the business associate "of demonstrating that all notifications were made as required" by HIPAA.

    The policies should be consistent with what is in the requirements of a business associate agreement in as it relates to the timing to report a breach. HIPAA requires notification of a breach "without unreasonable delay" but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach. Most covered entities we've worked with want that timeline to be much shorter, and the range we usually hear is somewhere between 24 hours and 5 days. This can be a sticking point in business associate discussions. Some hosting providers have polices in place for breach reporting that are 30 days, 45 days, or even 60 days out; this is not typically inline with what a hospital, payer, or another large healthcare enterprise would expect from a business associate agreement and a breach policy for a business associate that they are working with. Despite the 60 day window, HIPAA rules also go on to require "evidence demonstrating the necessity of any delay." If it takes 60 days, there have to be reasons given for that delay.

    Breach policy and breach notification are things that are extremely important. There are templates for breach notification, but the policy alone does not mitigate risk. There needs to be an understanding within the organization, business associate, or covered entity of what a breach is and what the breach policy is. There also need to be auditing and logging and other systems (IDS) in place to detect and investigate a breach. Detecting the breach is often the challenge which is why having a comprehensive audit log is necessary and, more importantly, being able to generate alerts off the log is critical. Look for something from us to help you address this problem shortly.

    At Datica we have [both](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#hitech-act-and-omnibus-rule:-it-security-provisions) a breach policy and a breach checklist that we can follow in the case of a breach. We've mock tested this policy and checklist to assure it makes sense and all relevant workforce members understand their roles.

  :summary: While HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is heavy on technology,
    HIPAA Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and
    policy.
  :lead: |-
    HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is very heavy on technology. Encryption of PHI while in transit, disaster recovery—these are intense technical considerations.

    Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and policy. While it's true major technological considerations exist—for example, don't store plaintext passwords!–components like Access Control Lists (ACLs) and credentialing are just as important as far as HIPAA goes.
  :post: |+
    Here are a few domains to consider related to HIPAA compliance within a digital health application.

    ## Credentials and provisioning
    The value of a digital health product is the personal experience bestowed upon each user. That can't happen without authentication and authorization.

    Authentication is one of the primary threat vectors from malicious network actors, so getting it right is a major part of compliance. Often an existing enterprise already has an LDAP or Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism in place, so a digital health application will need to integrate with those on a customer-by-customer basis.

    Don't forget with onboarding new users that all communication here must be compliant and secure. For example, don't share passwords or PHI via email, and understand how email is one of the most exploitable threat vectors that exist in today's enterprise technology climate.

    Rotating passwords is a compliance requirement, so implementing a plan which helps users reset their password regularly and securely is a requirement.

    ## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    Access Control Lists, or ACLs, are a concept that manages what data can be seen by which users. ACLs are enormously complicated because there are many variables: People, roles, geography, employment, BAAs, plus many more factors. Being uncalibrated either way can be disastrous: On one side, you might get angry users who are upset they are blocked from seeing some data they should see. On the other side, if too much data is exposed, you violate HIPAA compliance and those people are even angrier. The former results in users not wanting to use your product and giving bad word-of-mouth recommendations, while the latter results in bad press and potentially lawsuits.

    Administration of ACLs has many dimensions. For example, an ACL could change situationally by user role and location.

    ACLs are managed at the application level and are a major part of HIPAA compliance.

    ## Usage audits
    Continuous auditing at the infrastructure and application levels is a requirement for compliance. At the infrastructure level, it’s things like process logging. At the application level, it's things like tracking which authenticated user saw what data when.

    Proper app audits track who saw what and when. Keep in mind these [audit logs need to be stored](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) in a compliant way as well since it's probable the logs have PHI in them.

    ## Technical considerations
    The good news about compliance at the application level is there are few "gotcha's" with regards to technology and security. Simply put, if the product is secure, then it will be compliant. The basics you would do whether you are in healthcare or not will cover HIPAA.

    For example, don't store plain text passwords. Ensure you don't leave open any form vulnerabilities which expose your database (good old [Bobby O'DROP_TABLE](http://bobby-tables.com/) will never die). Elements of that nature.

    If you do the basics all application developers should do anyways, you'll be compliant.

    ## Proving compliance at the application level
    Which leads to how to prove compliance.

    At the infrastructure level, it's easy—and common—to find a partner who does most the work. Maybe you are deployed directly on AWS and handle most of the compliance obligations yourself. Maybe you utilize [Datica's platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) to satisfy the entirety of HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level. The point is it's possible and common to let someone else take care of compliance at that level for you. The end result is _they_ will prove compliance on your behalf. For example, Datica is HITRUST CSF Certified and had 3 independent audits. Leveraging that is how you prove compliance at the infrastructure level.

    But the fact of being a digital health company, and the very nature of building an application, means _you_ own this level. You can't hand off the risks and compliance obligations to someone else. Consequently, it's on _you_ to prove compliance.

    The good news is it's possible. The bad news is it's not free.

    In short, the best way to prove compliance at this level is to get your company audited by an independent auditor, who will examine your company in totality, or the app specifically.

  :summary: 'Day 3 of re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing Fargate
    among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we''re excited about Fargate?

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
    dir=\"ltr\">No longer any need to manage servers and clusters for your containers
    - AWS Fargate - Run ECS and EKS without managing servers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reInvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reInvent</a>
    <a href=\"https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL\">https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lZnS558CXV\">pic.twitter.com/lZnS558CXV</a></p>&mdash;
    AWS re:Invent (@AWSreInvent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/935910336212844544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November
    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
