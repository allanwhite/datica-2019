:post: |2

  Getting started with compliance on the cloud is easiest if you have a stepwise approach. Conveniently, there is a model made for this. It’s called the [maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/). The maturity model can be followed along a five-level framework, outlined later in this post. The goal is to start with the basics and work your way to a more mature compliance program and state. Of note, the later levels of the maturity model are hard to achieve in their totality. The maturity model is a framework to continually improve and optimize your compliance program.

  ## Maturity Model Stages

  Below are the 5 levels of the maturity model.

  1. __Policy__. Informed by privacy, these are the overarching, highest level policies for the handling of data and technology.
  2. __Procedure__. These translate the policies from level one above into actionable steps that can be followed.
  3. __Implementation__. These are the specific technical manifestations, or technical configurations, for the procedures above.
  4. __Measurement__. Once implemented, the configurations need to be measured on a continual basis to ensure continued alignment with procedures.
  5. __Management__. As gaps or anomalies are identified through measurement, procedures and resources need to be available to address them.

      <p>Example: <code>"Users shall only be provided with access to
      internal and external network services that
      they have been specifically authorized to use.
      Authentication and authorization mechanisms
      shall be applied for users and equipment."</code></p>
      <p>Each piece of technology needs to go through a similar process.</p>
      <p>This is an example <strong>Capability Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand the maturity of controls.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  ## Design Phase - Levels 1 through 3

  The design phase technically includes the first three levels of the maturity model. Starting with building out a set of overarching policies. These policies need to be specific to an organization but there are general structures and even [free templates](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/) available to help you get started.

  Considering the changing nature of technology and cloud technology, in particular, policies still need to be generic enough to be consistent despite the changes. These policies flow to slightly more dynamic procedures that outline the ways that people and tools follow policies. Procedures are then implemented into specific configurations. Below is an example to make this more concrete.

  Let’s assume, as an organization and to meet the compliance requirements for the data and/or geographies relevant to you, you need to monitor access to your data (this is something you should do regardless of compliance requirements). You create a policy that states that you log all access to data and provide automated tooling for detecting anomalies or high-risk events. You then create 1-n procedures for how you collect, store, and review those logs and events. Then, you implement your technology (servers, applications, network devices, cloud services, etc) to gather the relevant data and move it to the appropriate storage location as defined by your procedures. In addition to automated tooling, you will likely also have some manual process of reviewing logs.

  If that’s all done, you’ve successfully climbed the maturity ladder through level three. You need to do this for each control and requirement so it is not a trivial amount of work. That said, this structure can be used over and over again.

  ## Operationalize - Levels 4 and 5

  Operationalizing your compliance program, from a maturity model point of view, encompasses measurement and management. It is rare for organizations to achieve 100% success, or scoring in the context of HITRUST, for levels four or five. Depending on the risk profile and scale of your organization, you can be HITRUST Certified without passing, or at least passing completely and for all controls, on levels four and five.

  Once you implement your technology inline with your procedures which, in turn, tie up to your policies, you need ways to measure your controls to detect anomalies for investigation. There should be an expected state — your implementations — that you measure against. You then need resources, both human and capital, and procedures to manage any detected anomalies.

  While you can be HITRUST Certified without passing completely on levels four and five, these levels are becoming increasingly important. The reason for their importance is the nature of the cloud. The cloud opens up configurations to non-admin and non-ops users, such as software developers. The cloud also changes the available tooling and configurations for [abstracted services](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/compliance-is-a-team-sport/) on a constantly dynamic basis. Measuring and managing your compliance program on the cloud is imperative to identify implementation anomalies and reduce your risk.

  Extending the example from above on monitoring access to data, let’s start with the assumption that the technical tools and processes have been put in place to create, store, and analyze an event/log pipeline. The next step, level four (measurement), means you should be tracking to ensure the tools and data are flowing as expected and any manual processes, like reviews of logs, are being done. There is some automation in this process to detect data flow; this automation should be tested on a regular basis to ensure it is working. In the case of Datica, we also use a manual process to monitor manual event review activity; this involves reviewing activity in [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

  Extending into level five (management), there should be resources dedicated to addressing anomalies and gaps identified by measurement. This includes both staff and budget (dollars) set aside for compliance-related work.

  ## Don’t do it all at once

  The example above about monitoring access to data is trivial but speaks to what needs to be done over and over again for each control. The most important thing, because this can become daunting fast, is to just get started. And the maturity model gives a clear stepwise approach on where and how you can get started. Start at level zero by determining the compliance regimes to which you need to comply. Then develop policies (level one), either using an [open source template](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/), from scratch or engage with a third-party consultant to help in the process. Then move to level two and on from there.

  Don’t worry about the higher levels until you’ve ironed out each level beneath them. Developing a compliance program is a journey and you need to take the first step to get to your end goal. The unique thing about the compliance journey *on the cloud* is that the path continually changes despite the destination being a static target.

  :summary: In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure, and
    ways to leverage a maturity model, such as the HITRUST maturity model, to optimize
    your compliance posture.
  :lead: Many people view compliance as a checkbox or something you just have to do
    in order to operate within a certain geographic or vertical market. While privacy,
    compliance, and security are not the same things, none of them are simple bolt-ons
    or checkboxes. Another common misconception is that doing security right means
    you are compliant. This is simply untrue and represents a historic view of compliance
    as a liability instead of as an asset to be used for competitive advantage.
  :post: "\nCompliance is not binary but when you think about it as a checkbox or
    afterthought you end up framing it in that way. The nuance of compliance is represented
    well in the maturity model now commonly used in practice for evaluating compliance
    programs and requirements. Maturity models take different forms. At Datica, we
    leverage HITRUST for our compliance program so use the HITRUST-specific flavor
    of maturity model, which in turn is based on the [NIST Program Review for Information
    Security Management Assistance (PRISMA)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir7358.pdf)
    methodology. In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure,
    and ways to leverage a maturity model to optimize your compliance posture.\n\n##
    The Purpose of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA framework was created by NIST
    to support the vast array of information technology and information security requirements
    of federal agencies. In this mandate, it has flexibility and extensibility built
    into the maturity model. This flexible structure is highly aligned with the needs
    of a compliance maturity model for the cloud as the cloud has a huge array of
    different technology implementations and use cases. Additionally, as we will see
    with the actual scoring of maturity models, the thresholds can be set differently
    based on the risk to specific organizations and information system environments.\n\n##
    Structure of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA model, and similarly the HITRUST
    maturity model, have five distinct maturity levels. For the purposes of this guide,
    we will focus on the [HITRUST maturity model](https://hitrustalliance.net/documents/csf_rmf_related/RiskAnalysisGuide.pdf)
    from this point on, which again is a modified version of the PRISMA with the first
    three maturity levels being the same. HITRUST, in its own words, buckets levels
    one through three as “design effectiveness” and levels four and five our as “operational
    effectiveness”.\n\nThe HITRUST maturity levels are outlined below with summary
    points.\n\n1. __Policy.__ These are the high-level policy and standard documents
    that outline the goals and define the overarching compliance program within an
    organization. HITRUST clearly states that these include “shall” and “will” statements,
    clearly articulating, in writing, the formal goals of an organization. The starting
    point for policies is often a mix of internal data privacy needs and external
    compliance regimes to which the organizations must attest and ultimately comply.
    \ These should be made easily accessible to all employees and contractors.\n2.
    __Procedures.__ Procedures define the ways in which policies are to be carried
    out or implemented as well as the specific teams and individuals that are responsible
    for them. In the simplest form, procedures outline how an organization follows
    its own policies. This can be an extremely detailed and difficult step but is
    essential to tying policies, above, to implementation, below, in a consistent
    and defensible way.\n3. __Implementation.__ This is the actual implementation
    of the controls (settings, configurations, etc) that are defined by procedures
    and mandated by policies. Once implemented, and ideally required by procedures,
    these implementations should have some initial testing performed to ensure baselines
    have been achieved.\n4. __Measurement.__ Ongoing, not one and done, testing of
    all three of the above maturity levels is required to successfully achieve this
    level. These are self-assessments performed internally within an organization.
    Baseline metrics or KPIs for policies, procedures, and implementations should
    be defined and tracked over time. Threats are dynamic, more now than ever with
    the pace of technology and the cloud, so those need to be continually assessed
    as well. In some respects, this maturity level is an ongoing risk assessment or
    a set of mini risk assessments.\n5. __Management.__ From our experience, “Managed”,
    as a maturity level, is the least well understood; it’s also rarely achieved or
    fully achieved, by organizations going through a HITRUST assessment. Managed is
    tied to Measured above in that it is assessing how an organization responds to
    the outcomes, or measures, of control testing. An example is when testing detects
    anomalies. In those cases, do organizations have processes and procedures that
    are followed to assess the root cause of the anomalies and then address or make
    changes as to ensure alignment with policies and procedures. One key activity
    in this level is setting metric goals and then assessing and responding to those
    over time.\n\n## Privacy, Security, and Compliance\n\nThere is a tight interplay
    between privacy, security, and compliance. Oftentimes there is confusion on the
    boundaries of each. Leveraging the maturity model is an easy way to differentiate,
    albeit with some gray area remaining, between these increasingly important functions.
    At Datica, we take this approach and leverage it to break down the maturity model
    to assess our privacy, compliance, and security independently.\n\nWe view Privacy
    as largely residing at the Policy level, with some input from Compliance in terms
    of external frameworks and requirements (like GDPR in Europe). Procedures are
    coupled tightly with Implementation and both align with the functions of Security.
    The last two levels, Measurement and Management, fit with the functions of Compliance
    to continually assess, certify, and document necessary compliance artifacts and
    corrective action plans.\n\n\n<div class=\"row bg-white collapse pad group align-middle

    \   shall be applied for users and equipment.\"</code></p>\n    <p>Each piece
    of technology needs to go through a similar process.</p>\n    <p>This is an example
    <strong>Capability Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand
    the maturity of controls.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## How HITRUST Scores the Model\n\nScoring
    of the maturity model is complex and beyond the scope of this article. At a high
    level, each control, of which there can be hundreds, is assessed against the maturity
    model. The maturity model is not applied to an organization as a whole, but to
    each specific HITRUST control. For each control, each maturity level is rated
    as: \n\n* Non-Compliant (0%),\n* Somewhat Compliant (25%),\n* Partially Compliant
    (50%),\n* Mostly Compliant (75%), or \n* Fully Compliant (100%). \n\nThe percentage
    is supposed to coincide with a rough numerical equivalent. When completing a HITRUST
    assessment, there is a rating for each maturity level for each control. If you
    have 50 relevant HITRUST controls, you have 250 maturity ratings (50 x 5). These
    ratings are verified by 3rd party assessors and ultimately certified by HITRUST.
    These ratings are then used to calculate an overall rating, which determines if
    you pass or fail the assessment.\n\n## How to use the Maturity Model\n\nThe maturity
    model is an excellent framework to build, maintain, and optimize a full stack
    compliance program; in HITRUST terms, it can be used to both “design” and “operationalize”
    your compliance program. _Full stack_ in this context means _full stack maturity_,
    or successfully demonstrating compliance across all levels of the maturity model.
    In practical terms, even using the maturity model as a guide, there is not a time
    when you are “fully compliant” and can sit back and relax. Compliance needs to
    be ongoing and proactive, and the maturity model is a framework that can be leveraged
    to do that over time and to meet the myriad of new technologies, partnerships,
    data, and compliance tools.\n\nAt Datica, we leverage the [HITRUST maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/).
    We used it to ensure consistency from policies, or privacy, through implementation,
    or security, to management, or compliance. We even classify the technology tools
    we use into the levels of the maturity model they help to address. An example
    of this would is the logging mechanism we use fits into implementation, the events
    we log into procedures and policies, and the documentation of log review into
    measurement and management. We have had successful outcomes, and eased our external
    audit burden, by aligning and mapping our privacy, security, and compliance posture
    to a maturity model.\n\n\n\n\n"

  :blog_lead: Compliance is not solely the domain of internal audit or privacy groups,
    or whatever other groups may have historically owned it. In this [post-cloud world](https://completecloudcompliance.com),
    with abstracted managed services from cloud service providers (CSPs), the barriers
    between privacy, security (or info sec), and compliance have blended. And not
    just between those groups but also with IT. And, to complicate things further
    and necessitate more change in the way organizations view and operate their compliance
    programs, even within IT the barriers have been broken down and the cloud has
    enabled software developers to configure and deploy infrastructure without system
    admins or DBAs and, in many cases, without the explicit sign-off of security.
    In this brave new world of compliance on the cloud, operating compliance as a
    team sport is essential.
  :post: |2+

    ## The cloud turns developers into admins

    Managed services on the cloud, such as database-as-a-service (DBaaS), make it simple for software developers to deploy and scale their own infrastructure. Using web UIs or basic command line tooling and APIs, these managed services expose infrastructure pre-built for developers to use. The underlying layers of the technology stack have been abstracted away from users.

    The setup of these services does not require a Linux or Windows admin and, as such, developers can now easily circumvent the process by setting up their own cloud services. Using the above referenced UIs, developers are essentially configuring parts of the underlying operating system, software packages, and networking. These configurations, if not set properly, can violate the policies of an organization and expose data to unauthorized access.

    ## The operator construct must have security as a pillar

    While empowering developers to directly interact with and manage their own infrastructure, the cloud does not remove the need for operations, it just changes the role and specific functions required of them. Managing large-scale cloud deployments required dedicated operators, not just developers. Setting up and managing development pipelines to the cloud similarly is the purview of operations and not developers. There are other examples of the new role DevOps plays on the cloud.

    One area that is sometimes missed, but is becoming its own dedicated area, is SecDevOps, or security-focused DevOps. Security needs to be a core part of the function of DevOps on the cloud, whether for cloud workloads managed by operations or for simpler cloud workloads managed directly by developers. Operations groups need to work with compliance (see below) to translate existing policy and procedure requirements for the cloud to ensure whatever groups and individuals are managing cloud workloads are not exposing an entity to risk.

    ## Compliance must inform the security posture operators enforce

    Policies and procedures should be developed by compliance with input from privacy. Typically, the challenge we see on the cloud is the translation of these often static policies into more dynamic procedures and cloud configurations to meet the needs of IT to leverage new cloud services. This translation process is exceptionally difficult because it’s a continual process to map compliance policies to new and emerging cloud services and configuration options. Compliance needs to work with operations, DevOps, or SecDevOps, to ensure the proper translation is created and maintained.

    ## Internal audit and compliance must have visibility into cloud configs

    Once approved cloud configurations have been established, visibility into deployed cloud workloads and actual configurations is required to ensure identification and remediation of gaps. Given the dynamic nature of the cloud and cloud services, gaps will emerge, necessitating near real-time visibility into the compliance posture of the cloud. The key to managing an effective compliance program on the cloud is transparency into cloud inventory (workloads, services, environments, etc) and, ideally, proactive identification of gaps between approved cloud service configurations/states and actual cloud service configurations/states. The first step to remediate gaps is to identify them.

    ## Education and alignment top to bottom is necessary

    Compliance on the cloud is new but it is emerging, along with cybersecurity, as a top challenge for all organizations. The change now is that the only way to create and maintain a successful cloud compliance program is to align resources across multiple groups within an organization. From policy to cloud configurations to reporting and visibility, groups need to work together like links in a chain.

    In many ways, compliance on the cloud is like an assembly line. Compliance, with input from privacy, designs the process, works with security and IT to implement it on the cloud, and creates real-time reporting to measure the outputs of the process. The only way for this to work is to operate as a team with a common goal — protect data and digital assets while enabling organizations to build the technology to continue to compete.

  :summary: With all the attention on compliance and the need for compliance artifacts,
    or evidence, to be successful, it’s helpful to understand more about artifacts.
  :lead: "Artifact has been used both as a historical/cultural reference and technology
    term. But it seems to be gaining traction in the world of cloud as a term du jour.
    [Azure uses it to describe software packages](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/)
    that can be shared and ensure consistency for teams. [Google uses the term similarly
    for builds](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/build-test-deploy-artifacts).
    And AWS recently launched [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/), a
    portal for customers to gain access to AWS compliance reports. \n"
  :post: "\nThe AWS use for the term artifact for its new portal is the most relevant
    for this guide. In this guide, we walk through the importance of compliance artifacts
    for an effective compliance program. Compliance artifacts are often synonymous
    with compliance evidence. Using this definition, this is a simple topic. But compliance
    artifacts in the context of the cloud are anything but simple. In today's world
    of cloud services, managed services, and APIs, the breadth of artifacts is massive.
    This article also touches on data artifacts that are being shed, often unknowingly,
    by cloud services and can contain protected data that needs to be handled as all
    other protected information is handled.\n\n## Introduction to Evidence\n\nWhen
    it comes to compliance, a [compliance maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    is a good place to start to appreciate the value of evidence. While privacy defines
    the high-level policies for the management of data and technology, and security
    is the implementation of those privacy-driven policies, compliance is the effective
    measurement of the entire compliance program, from policies through secure implementation.
    Measurement is all about documentation, ideally on an ongoing basis, in support
    of a functioning compliance program and the following of compliance policies.\n\nHopefully,
    compliance is not seen as a checkbox within your organization. When compliance
    is seen as a roadblock or something that is bolted on after the fact, evidence
    is generated and stored for an auditor. It is not seen as having value and it
    is not used internally to monitor and improve compliance posture. Evidence should
    be used to [constantly internally monitor](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    your compliance posture and ensure proactive identification of gaps, threats,
    and risks that can then be mitigated. A mature compliance program does not simply
    implement secure technology configurations and internal processes, it actively
    manages those configurations and implementations to proactively identify and resolve
    gaps, find areas for improvement, and, something we’ve seen at Datica, identify
    where there might be human resource gaps.\n\nCompared to the post-cloud world
    of today, technology choices and workflows were previously limited. Similarly,
    in a pre-cloud world, compliance evidence was more confined. Today, the cloud
    opens up a new world of compliance evidence in the form of both manually generated
    artifacts (most cloud providers can generate certain data and reports on demand)
    and automatically generated artifacts (APIs, logs, event streams, etc). The compliance-relevant
    artifacts generated by cloud services are not well understood or appreciated,
    either by the users of the cloud or by auditors and assessors.\n\n## Examples
    of Compliance Artifacts\n\nWith all the attention on compliance and the need for
    compliance artifacts, or evidence, to be successful, it’s helpful to see common
    examples. The list below is an example list from Datica. It is certainly not exhaustive
    and there are different tools to accomplish the same things.\n\n- __Jira Tickets__.
    We are heavy [Atlassian users](https://www.atlassian.com/) at Datica. In addition
    to general company documentation, we use Confluence for documenting and change
    control for our procedures. When it comes to artifacts, we leverage Jira tickets
    and projects to ensure we document how we follow procedures and provide a historical
    record, with all interactions of users, for all compliance related tasks. We use
    templating in Jira to minimize variability in compliance procedure workflows.
    Jira provides good integrity to ensure logging of activities on tickets.\n  -
    __Event Reviews__. We have certain regular review activities we do per our policies.
    These are scheduled at some cadence from weekly to monthly up to annually. The
    most common examples are things like reviewing logs, vulnerability scan, virus
    scans, system inventory, etc. \n  - __Deployment Tickets__. We do security reviews
    as a part of our deployment ticket process. This aligns our operations with our
    configuration management policies and provides a separation of duties between
    security (reviewers) and operations.\n- __Workstation Configurations__. We standardize
    on MacOS machines at Datica and use [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) to manage those
    machines remotely and ensure hardened configurations are in use. Jamf reports
    are reviewed and logged in Jira but the actual report is also an artifact.\n-
    __Support Tickets__. Some of the events that are triggered by our scans are relevant
    to our customers and, in those cases, we sometimes use Zendesk to communicate
    with them. This means we’ve had to use Zendesk tickets at times for compliance
    artifacts.\n- __Cloud Configurations__. One of the new risk vectors with the cloud
    is configuring managed services from cloud service providers to comply with our
    compliance policies. This is very much an emerging area, one we go deep into in
    our [new book on cloud compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). The challenge
    is not simply setting parameters correctly for cloud services (things like encryption
    and open ports and backups) but also ensuring those configurations don’t change.
    The configuration themselves would ideally be snapshotted to create a historical
    record of evidence. Some of this can be done today with APIs but much of it is
    still manual and bespoke for each cloud service and each cloud provider.\n- __Events__.
    We document our event reviews in Jira, as stated above, but the content of the
    events themselves are also artifacts. For logging, we leverage the [ELK stack](https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/)
    for immediate, shorter-term log storage and access. By policy, we move log data
    to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and retain that data for at least a year.\n-
    __System Inventory__. Doing a system inventory is a lot more difficult on the
    cloud, especially if you have a fleet of hundreds or thousands of instances and
    leverage managed services (like S3 above). In the good old days of data centers
    and purchased hardware, tracking sheets with serial numbers were the norm. Today,
    with virtualization, managed cloud services, and the on-demand nature of the cloud,
    system inventories are harder and harder grok, especially if you need accurate
    historical records. At Datica, we focus on retaining our monthly inventory, based
    on a mix of sources including cloud billing information.\n- __Network Diagrams__.
    This can also be more challenging on the cloud given the nature of virtualization
    and abstraction. We manage a lot of different cloud accounts and environments
    at Datica and typically try to enforce a standard network architecture across
    all of them. This network architecture is what we maintain and it is validated
    by our system inventory.\n- __People Operations__. Compliance is not just about
    technology. Some of the content that would historically be a part of an employee
    file also contains relevant compliance artifacts.\n  - __Employment Agreements__.
    Not all employment agreements are relevant for our compliance program and our
    HITRUST Certification, but some, like our IP agreements, are relevant and we have
    to provide them during our audits.\n  - __Background Checks on Personnel__. We
    conduct background checks on all new employees. We persist these reports as artifacts
    for future reference.\n  - __Security Training__. HIPAA, and most other compliance
    regimes, require regular security training. In reality, given the nature and value
    of digital data today and the role all companies play as stewards of that data,
    security training should be done at every organization, ideally tailored to the
    specific organization. At Datica, we require annual training and we document using
    G Suite (from Google). We also provide [open source HIPAA training](https://training.datica.com)
    if you’re looking for starter content for your own organization.\n- __Patch Testing__.
    Despite the adoption of the cloud and abstracted services from cloud providers
    (some levels of abstraction include the OS and software packages so patching falls
    on cloud providers), unpatched software is and remains one of the most relevant
    threat vectors. Patchers should be tested before going out to production systems
    and this patch testing should be documented, along with the ultimate patch information
    metadata when the patch is actually installed into production. Jira is a good
    tool for this as well.\n- __SLAs__. We have SLAs with the various cloud service
    providers (CSPs). As a part of our [HITRUST Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance),
    we are required to assess the performance of CSPs against their stated and committed
    service levels. We do this on an annual basis and we document it using Jira tickets.\n-
    __Risk Assessments__. Risk assessment, and risk generally, should be the driving
    force behind many compliance and security decisions. Full risk assessments should
    be done at least annually while mini-risk assessments, those that evaluate significant,
    and sometimes even small, changes to your technology and compliance program should
    be done on an ad hoc basis as needed. At Datica, we leverage a risk assessment
    template in a Google Sheet that is based on NIST standards for risk assessments.\n\n##
    How to Use Artifacts\n\nArtifacts should be used to 1) internally monitor and
    measure the performance of your compliance program and 2) externally validate
    your compliance program for auditors and other third parties. In both uses, organization
    and regular pruning of your compliance artifacts are essential (pruning doesn’t
    mean deleting).\n\nThe major challenge we’ve experienced at Datica is compliance
    artifact overload and consistent organization, especially with personnel changes
    (growth and departures). Your compliance program, and the associated evidence,
    should not be tied to any one individual and should outlast your team. This is
    easier said than done.\n\nAs you can see above, there are a lot of different forms
    of artifacts from the documentation of reviews (we use Jira for this) to logs
    to scans to SLAs to personnel files and more. We’ve tried multiple times to consolidate
    our tooling but, in the end, we still have a mix of Jira, Zendesk, AWS S3, ELK
    (on CSP), and G Suite. This highlights the volume and variety of compliance artifacts
    for a modern cloud company and the associated challenge of organizing those artifacts.
    We still use regular manual grooming to ensure things are in the right places.\n\nSince
    we’ve been unable to consolidate all of our artifacts into one tool, the key is
    to document, ideally within the procedures themselves, where each type of compliance
    artifact is stored and to ideally ensure there is a separation between those that
    create/store the artifacts and those that access/organize/prune the artifacts.\n\n##
    A Caveat of Securing Artifacts (and risks)\n\nBackups, APIs, logs, scans, tickets
    and more can and do create a lot of data exhaust. This data exhaust can be in
    the content itself or in the metadata associated with the artifacts. This data
    exhaust can contain PHI (logs are the easiest example to imagine this being the
    case) and, as such, needs to be secured and treated like any of PHI to which you
    are responsible. That means BAAs should be in place with any relevant tools/tech
    that are storing compliance artifacts and other protections, per your organizations’
    policies, should be implemented.\n\n## Starting is the Hardest Part\n\nEffectively
    capturing and managing compliance artifacts is not fun. And it’s not easy today
    as most organizations use a mix of service providers for various aspects of their
    technology. But it’s necessary to effectively move up the [compliance maturity
    model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    \ and being a trusted party in today’s world where trust is an essential asset.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
