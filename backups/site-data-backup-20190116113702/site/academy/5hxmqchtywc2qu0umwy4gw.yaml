:summary: Lets walk through the names, players and timelines for delivering your first
  HL7 Epic integration or any other EHR integration like Cerner or Allscripts.
:lead: |-
  You did it! You made your first big sale to a hospital. Your product is live. You proved your efficacy, and the impact with clinicians and patients is evident. To reduce double documentation or improve your application, your customer wants to receive data from the EHR. You'll need to work with a project team, sometimes 200-persons large, while mastering a new skillset.

  What needs to be done? Lets walk through the names, the players and the timelines of delivering your first integration with Epic Systems EHR (EpicCare) or any other EHR like Cerner or Allscripts.
:post: |
  ### The Players

  **Project Manager** - The person responsible for running the project plan and gathering resources. Depending on the integration size or scope, this person might wear multiple hats within IT *or* might be involved with operations within the healthcare organization itself.

  **Operational Owner** - The person responsible for buying your software (or their proxy) and your internal champion. This person will likely be involved in bringing the rest of the team in and helping you navigate through the system. This can be anyone from a department head to the CIO of the organization.

  **System Administrator/Network Engineer** - The person responsible for getting the VPN setup, which is likely the second thing you will do in the integration setup process. Knows that interfaces connect to IP addresses and ports, but likely isn't that curious about what data gets sent across.

  **Interface Engine Analyst/Engineer** - The person responsible for ensuring that the data is passing through the VPN and hitting the appropriate port on the interface engine. The interface engine is probably a product like Rhapsody, Intersystems Ensemble or eGate; all interfaces from all clinical software (not just the EHR) go through here. This person sets up the ports on the IP addresses you need to connect with. He or she usually isn't responsible for the details about the specific interface, but if your HL7 messages do not pass certain formatting/filtering criteria there will likely be errors that you will need to troubleshoot with this person. At a smaller organization, this may be the same person as the EHR Interface Analyst.

  **EHR/Application Interface Analyst/Engineer** - The person responsible for making sure that data from the Interface Engine drops an HL7 message from the Interface Engine successfully into the EHR. In Epic, this person is the *Bridges Analyst* and in Cerner they are the *Open Engine* analyst. If your data has an improperly formatted field or mapping, is using the wrong identifier for a person/order/document, or otherwise has a problem getting into the EHR, this person will let you know about the problem. It's worth noting that you'll probably only need to work closely with this person on *writing data into the EHR* via notes, flowsheets or results.

  **EHR (or application) Web Services Analyst/Engineer** - In many cases, notably when working with Epic, the person responsible for HL7 integration might not be the same person responsible for working with Web Services. In Epic, Web Services are used for NCPDP messages (ePrescribing), FHIR, IHE protocols (PIX/PDQ, XDS.b queries), and functions that relate to MyChart. [Epic explains this better than I can](http://open.epic.com/). Likewise, Cerner has MillenniumObjects and Allscripts has its own API for integration purposes. There may be some overlap between the Interface and Web Services roles; the big reason that there may be separation is that since these are different products from the EHR Vendor, support and staff may be bifurcated accordingly.

  **EHR/Application Analyst** - For writing data into the EHR, you'll need to validate the data that you are writing back into the EHR shows up in the right places (or that the "right places" are in fact built) For getting data out of the EHR, you'll need someone to trigger events (like scheduling an appointment or discharging a patient) to test the workflow that integration is facilitating. This is written up as one job role, but realistically it'll be different team members for various workflows. These may be some of the applications and their Epic application name that you would need to ensure that you had the right person online for testing.

  * Outpatient EHR (EpicCare Ambulatory) - Orders, Results, Notes, Flowsheets(discrete data).
  * Inpatient EHR (EpicCare Inpatient) - Orders, Results, Notes, Device Integration, Flowsheets(discrete data)
  * Scheduling (Cadence) - Scheduling, Patient Demographic Updates
  * Registration (ADT) - Hospital Patient Registration, Admissions, Discharges, Transfers [1](#footnote-1)
  * Surgery (OpTime) - Scheduling Surgical Cases
  * Lab/Radiology/Cardiology LIS/RIS/CVIS (Beaker/Radiant/Cupid) - Scheduling/Registration/Results for Lab/Radiology/Cardiology + Procedure Logs + Results
  * EMPI (Identity) - EMPI queries
  * Other - MyChart, Care Everywhere, other Web Services [2](#footnote-2)

  It's also worth noting that the process of getting data in or out the EHR doesn't necessary actualize its usefulness. Your Operational Owner should work with the appropriate EHR analysts to ensure that data written into the EHR is displayed in the correct reports and dashboards while ensuring that data that needs to be generated from the EHR receives the proper treatment in terms of decision support and workflow training.

  **Support Staff** - A larger organization likely has team members handle some amount of support. This person is probably who will contact you if there is downtime from the Hospital side or if they notice that errors are pooling up on your interface connection. Likewise, you will want to inform this person (or some other centralized resource) in the event that you notice a degradation of service

  ### The Stack

  We use Mirth Connect with Postgres as a backend here at Datica and I highly recommend it. It's open source with a permissive license and can satisfy most integrations needs for startups. It's ranked highly in KLAS. [You can give it a try here.](http://www.mirthcorp.com/products/mirth-connect)

  ### Why Datica?

  With all this information in tow, why do you need an integration partner?

  Because there is so much more to do. It takes plenty of specialized experience to make your first HL7 project go well, and Datica provides this for you in house. We provide you with:

  * A load-balanced, secure, highly-available Interface Engine on scalable cloud infrastructure (5 VMs). We run Mirth Connect, an open-source, KLAS ranked Interface Engine. Our infrastructure has been through two HIPAA audits and one HITRUST audit and is ready to plug into any healthcare organization in the country.
  * A dedicated hardware firewall that will meet the needs and bandwidth for any VPN with any healthcare organization in the United States.
  * Burst onto the scene with instant credibility in HL7: Certified EHR and Networking (CCNA) Professionals with years of experience on hand to guide you through the process of setting up an integration. We've worked with most EHR vendors and we're willing to do whatever it takes it get an integration done.
  * Lean on the tooling we've already built for customers and use our standard HL7-to-JSON libraries to get data in a format that's easier to deal with than pipe-delimited mumbo-jumbo.
  * Best-in-class monitoring and support from an engineering-first company.
  * Straight-forward pricing: Do you know that in 1990 the pitch for HL7 involved pricing for an interface costing less than $10,000? Why are you still paying through the teeth for it now?

  ### Conclusion

  We want to make interoperability easier for everyone. Look forward to more open-sourced advice and documentation in the future.

  [1]<a id="footnote-1"></a> There isn't always a clean line between Outpatient/Inpatient applications. There may be "outpatient" clinics in a hospital, which may use multiple systems. When in doubt, let the hospital pull in the right people.

  [2]<a id="footnote-2"></a> There are many new Epic apps and integrations possible every year. The ones listed are amongst the most common apps and integrations, but the list is not inclusive or wholly complete. If you're not sure who is responsible for a specific integration, it's best to lean on your operational owner/project manager who needs to be involved to get something done.

  :summary: HL7 is a healthcare industry standard for messaging between applications,
    for example from EHR to PMS. Learn HL7 basics, including HL7 v2 and v3.
  :lead: 'Health Level Seven (HL7) is a standard utilized by the healthcare industry
    to enable messaging between applications, EHR to PMS (practice management system)
    for example. It is managed and maintained by [Health Level Seven International
    (HL7)](http://hl7.org) which is a not-for-profit, ANSI-accredited standards developing
    organization. '
  :post: |
    The HL7 standard is often jokingly referred to as the “non-standard standard.” This is not very fair but it does reflect the fact that almost every hospital, clinic, imaging center, lab, and care facility is “special” in terms of how it implements HL7 (really?, why?). The reason is primarily because there is no such thing as a standard business or clinical process for interacting with patients, clinical data, or related personnel.

    The HL7 messaging protocol was designed to facilitate high volumes of pre-defined data to be shared across many applications reliably. The protocol selected to make this happen was a traditional file transfer or a TCP/IP **socket** in both a real-time and batched fashion. HL7 v2 message structure is complex, flat, and delimited. HL7 has obviously evolved over time. The current version of HL7 is v3, however, older versions exist and make up the bulk of the standard used today primarily because of the large number customizations that have been done to each HL7 message.

    #### The key differences between an HL7 v2 and HL7 v3 message are as follows:

    1. v2.x was primarily meant for clinical communications - medical orders, patient registration etc. whereas v3.x has additional features for use by informaticists and for government reporting requirements.
    2. v2.x was a custom format (barebones text - all coded and separated by a pipe with headers and multiple segments etc.) v2.x looks like this:

    ![academy-hl7protocol](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/612KI64BeokOUW82m0w0oc/f4b03fd55891221f038ed0e8ad1c1521/academy-hl7protocol.png)

    whereas an HL7 v3.0 message is an XML format (I'm not sure if that's an improvement) - very verbose and detailed - like this:

    ![academy-hl7syntax](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/Ea7Dy1f3CCGWM4uWEwsWK/7ac35d657e029cf8c71aa8dfaa33bef1/academy-hl7syntax.png)

    3. All v2.x formats are backward compatible. v3.x is a wholly separate format and not backwards compatible.

    Any technology solution in healthcare has to support both v2.x and v3.x formats. Open source parsing solutions exist to help with processing HL7 (see section below on Parsing HL7 messages). However, in this author's humble opinion, the 3.x standards are unlikely to be implemented given the investments already made in the 2.x versions. The [FHIR](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/) standards, which are still under active development, are more likely to be implemented rather than the v3.0 standards. See this Figure for some data supporting this hypothesis. (source: Corepoint)

    ![academy-figure1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2CnbugFEHqQ0SWymeeEWGK/33f4cac50b16d3845ddaf11f32d0a36c/academy-figure1.png)

    ### Customization

    Every conversation that you've ever overheard about HL7 usually includes customizations to be accounted for and associated implementation costs. When I was starting in this space, I heard the same things but wasn't really sure what it meant.

    So here's a summary of what I've learned. I will caveat this by saying that I am not an HL7 expert - there are folks out there who have much more extensive experience than I do; [Keith Boone](http://motorcycleguy.blogspot.com/) for one, whose blog is worth subscribing to if you have any interest in healthcare standards for one. Given that I'm not an expert, if you see any errors in this document, please let me know (and also let us know if you're looking for an interesting change in [careers](mailto:jobs@catalyze.io)).

    More about custom formats... HL7 messages are indeed customized but this does not imply, as an example, that every ADT (admission, discharge, transfer) message is different between different hospitals; ADT is ubiquitous so it's an HL7 message type you should know. Customization came about when certain message types, like ADT, could not support sending all the data elements that needed to be sent. For example, a message might be able to handle only 50 data elements but an EKG reading might need to send over 200. The extra data elements were then sent over using the notorious Z segment - a miscellaneous segment into which pretty much any key value pair could be jammed in. This custom blob of data in the Z segment would then need to be parsed and mapped etc. for automated processing and use, creating impressive levels of customization in data exchange.

    Before you get too excited, the true customization comes in the form of the content of the HL7 message. The HL7 organization has defined code sets to be used to translate the terse codes sent over within the HL7 message. See [here](https://www.impactportal.info/emrCodeSet.asp?SID=4) for a listing of some v2.3 code sets or [here](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) for a more comprehensive listing from the "horse's mouth." The purpose of the code sets, as you can imagine, is to codify the content to reduce the size of the message. ANT, as an example, stands for Anterior in the context of body sites and so on. And, by the way, these code sets for HL7 have also evolved / been added to / modified with each version of HL7. However, these code sets, which are released and maintained as part of the standard, aren't often adhered to. EHRs (usually) and hospitals have defined their own code sets. So the content sent over within the HL7 message needs to be "looked up" against that specific code set before it can be made useful. An Epic code set is unique (although common across Epic deployments) and different from an AllScripts code set. This is the uniqueness that must be addressed by any solution in this space and the reason why HL7 implementations can sometimes be expensive - they need to take into account not only the Z segments and map them to the appropriate data models but the code sets have to be taken into account as well.

    So, in practice, HL7 can be perhaps best described as a messaging protocol and format standard in most implementations rather than as a comprehensive messaging standard.

    ### HL7 Message Types (most common)

    There are more than 80 message types, a whole host of segments and codes for pretty much anything you can think of. See [this](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) document for a pretty comprehensive listing. But the following are the most common HL7 message types:

    |Message Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |ACK|General acknowledgement message. This is the ack sent when a message is received by the destination system. ACKs are automated responses. However, you could use ACKs as a way to modulate the speed at which messages come through as the sending system will not send the next message until the ACK is received|
    |ADT|Admission, Discharge and Transfer message. Created whenever a patient goes through any of those states. There are a whole list of these possible states. See below for a sampling of a few more|
    |ORM|Pharmacy/treatment order message|
    |ORU|Observation message (unsolicited). Unsolicited because the destination systems are not asking for it, it is fired off and the source systems will take it in and process it if needed or discard it if not.|
    |BAR|Add or change the billing account.|
    |SIU|Schedule information (unsolicited) usually patient specific. This is used to create, modify and delete patient appointments and other schedules.|
    |MDM|Medical document management. This often acts as a workhorse. It is meant to handle documents like notes, reports etc. But often is used to capture a whole host of other data for which there is no easy mapping. In which case, the incoming data gets converted into a PDF and pushed into the EHR via this MDM message|
    |DFT|Detailed financial transactions. This data is used to capture the details of procedures etc. so that claims can be generated.|
    |MFN|Master files notification - changes to core data elements are sent through this.|
    |QRY|Query - as the name implies is used to query source systems for data on things like patient demographics etc.|
    |RAS|Pharmacy/treatment administration message|
    |RDE|Pharmacy/treatment encoded order message|
    |RGV|Pharmacy/treatment give message|

    ​It should also be noted that each of these message types have different types (sub-types) as well. For example, there are 51 (yep, that's right) different types of ADT messages that are used for various trigger events. Some of the most commonly used ADT messages include:

    - ADT-A01 – patient admit

    - ADT-A02 – patient transfer

    - ADT-A03 – patient discharge

    - ADT-A04 – patient registration

    - ADT-A05 – patient pre-admission

    - ADT-A08 – patient information update

    - ADT-A11 – cancel patient admit

    - ADT-A12 – cancel patient transfer

    - ADT-A13 – cancel patient discharge

    The important thing to remember is that the content of the message doesn't change all that much between all these sub-types. The message is still about the specific patient (PID segment - see segment section below).

    ### HL7 Segments

    A segment is a group of fields that then contain different types of data. Each segment exists independently and can be utilized in multiple messages, in different sequences. Segments may be required for a particular message or in other cases, they may be optional.

    A unique three-character code called the "Segment ID" identifies each segment. Segment ID codes beginning with the letter Z are reserved for the "custom" Z-segments (key value pairs) that are not part of the HL7 standard.

    You can remove one or more segments from a message if desired. But because HL7 rules state that unexpected or unused segments should be ignored, most systems will ignore the unexpected segments without issue (therefore, manually removing these segments is unnecessary). Segments should be removed only if one of the receiving systems will not have problems when unexpected segments are received.

    These are the most common segment types that will be used across multiple message types.

    |Segment Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |DG1|Diagnosis|
    |EVN|Event type|
    |GT1|Guarantor|
    |IN1|>Insurance|
    |MSH|Message header|
    |NTE|Notes and comments|
    |OBRI|Observation Request|
    |OBXI|Observation Result|
    |ORCI|Common Order|
    |PID|Patient Identification|
    |FT1|For DFT messages - Financial transactions|

    At a high level, that's HL7. Look for further articles delving into more details on HL7 message structures and the common message types.

    ### Why FHIR?

    The current state-of-the-art in healthcare integration and interoperability is based on HL7, and is a serious mess. Organizations today spend upwards of $5000 to $10,000 per HL7 interface, not to mention serious licensing fees to implement and use integration engines. All of which raise the interesting question of, "Wait, if they are all based on a standard, why do I need an integration engine?" For two reasons:

    1. HL7 is a standard but it is not an **open** standard. You need to be a member of the HL7 organization and pay  fees before using the content in any commercial fashion.
    2. HL7 is an ancient standard: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7) notes that it was developed in the late 80s when a lot of things we take for granted now didn't exist - mobile numbers, emails, NPI (national provider identifiers), APIs...

    What resulted was a lot of "I'll just do it **this** way", causing an explosion of HL7 variants. This, in turn, led to the need for interface engines where additional logic needs to be coded to accommodate those *"this-way"* variants and other healthcare specific use cases. That led to the bigger problem that integration and logic is now embedded into the data transformation process. Change your source system (upgrade, replace, etc.) and your integration falls apart. Need more data than you're currently getting, well, it's back to the integration engine again. Oh, by the way, there is no concept of CI / CD (continuous integration, continuous deployment) in the context of integration engines. Often developers make changes in production directly, which is also why healthcare institutions are very cautious about providing access to systems sending data to any external system, no matter the value. And for good reason, as you can imagine.

    #### A better, more modern approach to integration and interoperability

    FHIR has an ambitious goal. Integration capabilities should be built into the EHR itself along with the other aspects of authentication and security. Over time, this will eliminate the need for expensive integration projects and licenses. Additionally, the use of modern concepts such as [RESTful APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and accompanying documentation will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and get the data needed. From a design perspective, the general principle is that since healthcare is complicated, creating a standard set of models which are transactional in nature (like HL7) has been shown to be problematic. Therefore, creating core models (like patients, for example), having standardized data models around those core elements, and ensuring that most, if not all, use cases can be addressed by allowing requests to be **composed** as needed.

    Given the above, FHIR does offer many improvements over existing standards:

    - **It's open source**: This is a big deal and the first effort in making healthcare integration more transparent and accessible. Putting it out in the open has created a significant community including developers, vendors and enterprises.
    - **RESTful**: REST-based design brings a significant amount of benefit, namely that an API that adheres to the principles of REST does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the API. Rather, the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the service.
    - **Extensible**: Extensibility under the RESTful context ensures that additions can be easily tacked on to cover specific use cases without impacting the core models.
    - **Composable**: Composability ensures that almost any request can be cobbled together using core models or resources and associated extensions.
    - **Good documentation**: Uniquely driven by the RESTful API approach, which enforces good documentation as a byproduct. A playable version of the FHIR APIs would be a nice to have and is something that we, at Datica, intend to provide as part of this documentation.
    - **Support for modern web standards**: XML, JSON, HTTP, Atom, OAuth, REST - these are the underlying technologies that FHIR leverages. These are battle tested and have been proven at scale and under significant security requirements.

    #### Flexibility without modifying underlying systems or integration engines

    As described earlier, various healthcare workflows (e.g. z-segments in HL7) that forced extensions of standards is one of the biggest challenges with older integrations. Underlying systems required code changes to generate specific datasets and additional work on the integration engine to support the data processing. All this made it very cumbersome to create and manage integrations with any changes in the underlying source systems (e.g. upgrades etc.), causing a significant amount of rework.

    FHIR addresses this by:

    - **Focusing on ease of implementation**: Implementation is very different from most standards where the focus is typically more on coverage and data models. FHIR is interesting because the focus has been on ease of implementation from the beginning, including backwards compatibility. Multiple implementation libraries have also been provided in Java and .NET, among others, along with many examples to kick-start development. The website claims "multiple developers had simple interfaces working in a single day", which is unheard of in healthcare.
    - **Easy extensibility**: FHIR solves extensibility challenges by defining a simple framework for extending and adapting the existing resources. All systems, no matter how they are developed, can easily read these extensions and extension definitions can be retrieved using the same framework as retrieving other resources.
    - **Human readability**: HL7 3.0 had a concept of a human readable version of the document / data being shared to ensure that developers or clinicians could still read the source data to eliminate any potential of misconfiguration or coding errors. FHIR borrows this concept as well. Every resource carries a human-readable text representation using html as a fallback display option. This is particularly important for complex clinical information where many systems take a simple textual/document based approach.

    ### Advantages over existing standards, e.g. HL7

    - **Pipe delimited vs. JSON, XML...**: No further discussion is required. This approach makes it more easily usable, understandable and testable.
    - **Security**: HL7 as a protocol doesn't have security and authentication built into it. To be fair, HL7 was always meant to enable intra-system communication, like between lab systems and an EHR. All of which were within a health system's firewalls. Therefore authentication wasn't really needed. The evolution of healthcare has made care delivery more dispersed, which is why HL7 is beginning to show it's gaps. FHIR leverages (or is in the process of defining) modern https based authentication and authorization capabilities such as OAuth, which are prevalent in the modern web and have been battle tested over the years.
    - **Flexible and composable**: The FHIR design allows developers to combine requests to create any interface or extend resources (with associated definition) and "tack" them onto pre-defined resource models. [(More on the Resource Object here.)](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-fhir-resource-object-the-core-building-block) No coding up the underlying systems or touching interface engines required.

    ### Status and challenges

    FHIR is still a work in progress. It does have a few advantages.

    #### Significant industry support

    Individual developers and other organizations have contributed sample implementations, like [HAPI-FHIR](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/) and many more. Plus a significant group of enterprises have come together under the auspices of HL7 with the moniker of "Argonaut Project". This group includes EHR vendors and health systems such as
    - athenahealth
    - Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
    - Cerner
    - Epic
    - Intermountain Healthcare
    - Mayo Clinic
    - Meditech
    - McKesson
    - Partners HealthCare System
    - SMART at the Boston Children’s Hospital Informatics Program
    - The Advisory Board Company

    #### It's a work in progress

    Despite significant industry support, it is unlikely widespread implementations of FHIR will be seen until the 2016-2017 timeframe because definitions and specifications are still in progress, implementations are still underway and more EHR software changes are likely required.

    #### Security is still an open item

    Security with FHIR is incomplete. Authentication before Authorization or vice versa? Conformance and associated profiles per link? Is there to be an API route to call to verify that? Is that route open to everyone?

    #### Not real-time

    Currently the biggest gap, FHIR is not a real-time protocol. In contrast, HL7 was always a real-time protocol. If someone was admitted to the hospital, all relevant parties were notified immediately via ADT.

    FHIR is currently still a request based protocol. You ask if you need to know something such as _"Was this person admitted to the hospital?"_, which makes sense from a patient app perspective, but not so much from a workflow perspective. Webhooks are optional additions, but begs the question _"Why can't we just FHIR enable HL7?"_ The Datica answer is, _"Yes, indeed. It should."_

    #### Granular resource model can become request intensive

    ADT (and other HL7) messages were crafted with care to support hospital and ancillary system workflows. The flexibility and composability (described in the advantages section above) come at a cost. To get all the data that one normally expects from an ADT message would require a "bundle" of FHIR resources. This could get complicated and request-intensive quickly.

    ### Summary

    Overall, FHIR has a lot going for it. There are gaps but they are neither unexpected nor insurmountable. Stay tuned for updates as the FHIR standard evolves.

    — from security to management — that's tricky, time consuming, and expensive.
  :blog_lead: 'We are often asked about integrating with Epic, Cerner, Allscripts
    and every other EHR big or small. The people asking us for help range from digital

  :post: |
    Since we launched our EHR Integrations product we learned plenty of lessons about running an integration project on-time and on-budget. Even with years of guiding hospitals through Epic installs and being a former digital health startup founder myself, there were nuances to connecting the intersection of those two worlds that took some time to learn. Out goal is to make those nuances less foreign and more approachable so that _anyone_ can set up an integration without being afraid of the consequences.

    We recently added a new entry to our [Academy](https://datica.com/academy/) library where we discuss the process of integrating with Epic or any other EHR. It's more of a process and less of a technical exercise than you may think. [Read our overview on how to integrate with Epic.](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-integrate-with-epic-or-any-ehr/)

    Included in the new entry is a link to our 30-day project plan for HL7 installs. Full disclosure: working within the constraints of a healthcare organization might have an impact on your go-live date. Despite this, we've managed to run through this plan even faster in the past. Part of the reason we can move so quickly is that we've automated most of the deployment and have the talent in house to execute on it. I'm proud of the EHR Integrations team we've built so far and I'm looking forward to expanding our team and our platform in 2015.

  :summary: There's much a digital health company needs to know about EHR integrations.
    Here are 4 essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers.
  :blog_lead: 'During the past three years, we''ve done [a lot of integration work](https://datica.com/platform/success/).
    We''ve worked on more than 150 integration projects with almost 30 EHR vendors.
    We''ve done this work with big organizations and vendors to small FQHCs and niche
    EHR vendors. As a result of all this integration experience, we now have a pretty
    good grasp on the intricacies of how integration works. We can reasonably estimate
    how long it takes us to do a project and how that varies with different types
    of vendors. '
  :post: "> What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of
    a computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" -- Morpheus,
    The Matrix\n\nHowever, despite our progress, there are still hundreds of systems
    that we have not integrated with. In the ambulatory setting alone, there are more
    than 650 technologies certified for Meaningful Use Stage 2. While working with
    the top 30 already gives us a leg up and covers a majority of the industry, it's
    not uncommon for us to hear about a new piece of HIT technology that our customers
    and prospects are looking to integrate with. \n\nDespite your perceptions of us
    as an integration services team, we don't have any secret super powers to solve
    problems with interoperability. Our solution, as simple as it may sound, is just
    being the best at our specialized skill set as we can be. This means:\n\n- Writing
    interfaces and transforming data to programmer-friendly formats using Mirth, an
    open-source interface engine. \n- Setting up VPNs when needed on open-source Strongswan
    appliances.\n- Having a team of experts in health data and project management
    on hand to analyze project needs. \n- Everything hosted on the HITRUST-certified
    Datica Platform, staffed by a team of ops, security, and compliance experts. \n\nWhile
    we may know about obscure technologies that power integrations at a given EHR
    vendor, our process is likely similar to anyone else's when kicking off a project.
    As such, it's worth noting that **some projects may be impossible to complete**
    due to external constraints. Turns out that data blocking in healthcare is really
    a thing. So, if Datica is not helping you in your pre-sales process with customers,
    it's up to you to ask all the necessary questions to ensure that you will be able
    to successfully integrate your application with the EHR and site in question.
    \n\n## Four essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers\n\n###
    1) Can your EHR support my digital health product's scope?\n\n<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"
    alt=\"XKCD comic on complexity\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\">\n\nThe most
    common data integration formats we use to exchange health data are [HL7v2](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)
    and CDA-formatted documents like CCDs and CCDAs. Even though these data formats
    are standards, this doesn't mean all EHRs support exchanging data through these
    formats. In fact, some EHRs have no integration capabilities at all. Make sure
    the EHR supports the data standards that you need. Particularly, make sure the
    EHR supports the data standards in the method you need them. For example, if you
    need CCDs *pushed* to you at the end of a visit vs. *pulling* them proactively,
    you will want to ensure the EHR has the capability to manage that process. There
    is a very real possibility here that the EHR may have no suitable integration
    technology, which may limit your data integration possibilities to flat-file style
    extracts or may require manual data entry to power your application.\n\nIt's worth
    noting that there are some integrations [that seem simple but are really complex](https://xkcd.com/1425/).
    For example, while it would seem obvious that any EHR could expose provider availability
    to schedule appointments, this is actually rare functionality. It's *easy* to
    know what appointments are scheduled/canceled but it's *hard* to know when you
    can schedule an appointment. Just because there are no appointments from 12:00-2:00
    doesn't mean the provider isn't doing hospital rounds or research. As such, what
    may have been an easy API query on Allscripts, Epic, and Athena turns into a nightmare
    of stored procedure R&D and database access requirements with smaller EHRs. This
    is why it's good to have experts on hand to help you understand the rules of the
    road and to match integration expectations to reality. \n\n\n### 2) Do you have
    the internal or external resources to perform the integration work?\n\nSmaller
    organizations may have an EHR with HL7, CDA, or API integration capabilities,
    however, they might not have the personnel to configure their instance to do that
    integration. It's not uncommon to find a nurse or clinic administrator who is
    also the EHR administrator. While they may be able to manage their provider's
    schedules or handle some claims, setting up an interface or API may be foreign
    to them. This can be a blocker for a project. \n\nDatica cannot directly assist
    with a backend EHR build. This is usually for one of these reasons:\n\n- The EHR
    vendor would require us to sign an agreement that had some kind of non-compete
    clause to it. \n- The EHR vendor will not grant us access to their systems. \n-
    We simply lack the expertise in 650 EHRs. \n\nAs such, if the organization needs
    assistance with an internal EHR build, it's out of the scope of our standard integration
    services. While we may be able to refer the organization to other consultants
    or vendors who can assist with this EHR build, additional scope and cost considerations
    would be included.\n\n### 3) Can you commit to getting work done within reasonable
    timelines?\n\nThe top KPI for a fast, successful installation is an agreed upon
    project plan with assigned task owners and due dates. At larger orgs, the only
    task owners are typically the EHR integrators (Datica) and organizational IT.
    However, in some integrations, there may be dependencies on vendors to perform
    some pieces of setup. This is particularly true if the org is not licensed for
    a given interface yet or if the EHR vendor hosts the organization's EHR instance.
    \n\nNot to sell you a horror story but, sometimes, these timelines can be brutal.
    While many projects go live within a month of kickoff, we've also seen projects
    span a year due to EHR vendors dragging their feet on either contracting or infrastructure
    deployments. Other than badgering effectively, unless your customer's organization
    can push their EHR vendor to move faster, it's hard to make the process any faster
    than it is. If your integrated product must be live by a certain point to reach
    contractual obligations to your customer, make sure your customer has the means
    to get that system live by that point. \n\n### 4) Who will validate clinical content
    and logic facilitated through integrations?\n\nYour application may want to segment
    patients based on certain clinical attributes sent in the payload of the HL7 or
    CDA message. For example, you may want your application to send an alert when
    a patient with diabetes is admitted to the hospital. The question, of course,
    is how do you define patients with diabetes? Will they be manually defined by
    clinicians or will you be trying to define them by diagnoses from the admission,
    in their problem list, or by other clinical attributes like High A1C or being
    prescribed insulin?\n\nWhile we can apply some logic to segment patients in our
    interface engine, we do not have clinical informaticists on hand to dictate or
    validate logic that we would create at your behest. The integration engine may
    not be the best place to have that application logic and you may consider those
    mappings and analysis to be IP of your company. You may decide that an organization
    purchasing your digital health product can validate your clinical content (Epic
    did this) or we are happy to refer you to informatics consultants who are qualified
    to assist you.\n\n## Evaluate the Integration's TCO\n\nWith these additional parameters,
    you may want to re-evaluate the [cost to integrate](https://datica.com/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-integrations/)
    your digital health product. If you need to hire a niche EHR consultant to build
    an interface on the EHR itself and it costs $5k, can you pass that along to your
    customer or extract that value within your product? If not, you may debate the
    merits of deploying your product in a standalone fashion or adjusting the terms
    of your deal for your customer. If you're new to this, we can help. All [Datica
    Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) customers can engage with Datica for pre-sales
    support to define implementation strategies and to determine feasibility and ease
    of integration at a given site. \n"

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
