:lead: At Datica, we are often asked about SOC 2 Type II and how it relates to HIPAA
  and HITRUST. This article is to help explain how a SOC 2 Type II audit compares
  to HIPAA compliance and other regulatory audits in the United States.
:post: "\nBefore we explain SOC 2® Type II compliance, let’s get a baseline on SOC
  and the foundational SOC 1 report.\n\n## What is SOC 1?\n\nSOC is an abbreviation
  for Systems and Organizations Controls developed by the [Association of International
  for Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA)](https://www.aicpa.org/). SOC reports
  are in effect a product of the services that auditors provide their clients. A SOC
  1 report is specifically for internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nFor
  example, if you have a customer that is undergoing a financial audit, and you are
  providing that customer your services, the auditors of your customer will need a
  SOC 1 report from your service organization. [A SOC 1 Type I report](https://www.ispartnersllc.com/blog/soc-1-soc-2-reports-difference/)
  would attest that your service organization is suitably designed to achieve financial
  controls. A SOC 1 Type II report would attest to the design and the operating effectiveness
  over a specified period of time.\n\n## SOC 2 and SOC 2 Type II Compliance Defined\n\nSOC
  2 reports are attestations that your service organization has controls around the
  systems and processes that touch sensitive information that does not affect a customer’s
  financial reporting (remember that SOC 1 is for internal controls for financial
  reporting). \n\nSimilar to SOC 1, SOC 2 has two report types. The type 1 report
  tests and reports on the design of the organization’s controls. The SOC 2 type 2
  report tests and verifies that the design was operationally effective for a specified
  period of time.\n\nSOC II reports cover what are referred to as the [Trust Services
  Criteria](https://www.ssae-16.com/soc-2/) of security, availability, processing
  integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. The criteria, or principles, are elaborated
  as:\n\n* *Security* - information is protected from unauthorized access and damage,
  and the system that store and process that information, are also protected.\n\n*
  *Availability* - that the systems are accessible for operation, are monitored and
  maintained.\n\n* *Processing Integrity* - that systems achieve their intended aim
  and are unimpaired and are not error-prone.\n\n* *Confidentiality* - that the information
  is protected as required by regulatory law, or by legal contract, or even commitments
  made between parties. Confidentiality differs from privacy in that privacy is concerned
  with personal information, whereas confidentiality can be about broader sensitive
  information.\n\n* *Privacy* - that the personal information is handled in a way
  that aligns to the “entity’s objectives.” The privacy trust principle is elaborated
  to include even more detailed criteria around notice and communication of objectives,
  choice and consent, collection, use-retention-disposal, access, disclosure and notification,
  quality and monitoring and enforcement.\n\nFor more information, please reference
  the [Trust Services Criteria](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report.html)
  from the AICPA.\n\nWhen preparing a SOC 2 audit specifically for compliance the
  AICPA Trust Services Criteria are not generally used. The reason being is that in
  general, SOC 2 audits are for an internal audience and the evaluation of the organization
  by the principles is, by design, somewhat flexible, subjective, and sort of vague.
  However evaluating compliance to laws and regulations should not be too flexible.\n\nFor
  a SOC 2 compliance audit, an auditor, commonly the “practitioner,” will refer to
  the guidelines in the document [AT-C Sections 105](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00105.pdf)
  and [315 for Compliance Attestation](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00315.pdf).
  These compliance attestation guidelines differ from the trust services principles
  in the specificity that the practitioner will bring to the preparation of the report.
  \n\n## How does SOC 2 compare to HIPAA?\n\nFirst to keep in mind is that HIPAA is
  a regulation while SOC 2 is an auditing and reporting engagement. A SOC 2 Type 2
  report is not inherently healthcare specific and is [not required for cloud computing
  vendors](https://www.incapsula.com/web-application-security/soc-2-compliance.html),
  however, it is a best practice in securing your data. The Trust Services Principles
  and Criteria provides evaluation methodology that is intended to be flexible and
  applicable to different industries and practices, not specifically healthcare.\n\nFor
  a SOC 2 report on HIPAA compliance, the AICPA has worked with additioanl subject
  matters and criteria. They have developed an illustrative example, the [SOC for
  Service Organizations: SOC 2® HITRUST](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/soc2additionalsubjectmatter.html).
  This version of a SOC 2 Type II report draws on the HITRUST Common Security Framework
  (CSF). The partnership and working group also developed a mapping the controls of
  the HITRUST CSF to the AICPA’s Trust Services Principles. For the direct mappings,
  see [TSC Mapping to HITRST CSF worksheet](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/mappingsrelevanttothesocsuiteofservices.html).
  The benefit of this mapping is to make auditors more efficient in evaluating an
  entity regardless if they designed and executed audit procedures from either requirement.\n\n##
  What is a SOC 2 Report?\n\nA SOC 2 Type II report is the output of an SOC 2 audit
  from a third-party auditor. The report verifies whether or not that an entity has
  managed its data and protected the privacy of its clients. If one is applying for
  compliance, then a SOC 2 report attests whether the entity complied with regulatory
  requirements for a specified period of time.\n\nSOC 2 audits and reports are voluntary
  and are intended for management, shareholders, investors, and potentially as a signal
  of trustworthiness for customers. The reports provide transparency that an entity
  is protecting data and doing the right things. As an example, [Amazon (AWS) has
  a SOC 2 report](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/) description on their
  website that states what their audit covered. For shareholders, these reports signal
  that the organization is competent, well-managed and understands risk management.
  \n\nThe practitioner that prepares the report needs to determine whether or not
  the entity complied with requirements in all material respects, then expresses an
  opinion on whether that entity complied in all material respects. That the practitioner
  must express an opinion puts the onus on the auditor to be independent, impartial,
  and with a vested interest to maintain their professional reputation.\n\n## SOC
  2 Compliance Checklist\n\nDatica created a [HIPAA & HITRUST self-assessment worksheet](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/take-compliance-self-assessment/)
  and following the guidance in this lightweight assessment is a good starting point
  to get ready for a SOC 2 audit. \n\nIn brief, here are the things you need to have
  done:\n\n* People are appointed and in charge of Privacy and Security in your organization\n*
  Policies are in place. Datica has [open-sourced its policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/)
  for your use.\n* A risk assessment has been completed within the past 12 months\n*
  The laundry list of controls in place that align to Trust Services Principles and/or
  HITRUST CSF (i.e. antivirus, backups, disaster recovery, encryption, intrusion detection,
  logging, monitoring, vulnerability scanning, etc.)\n\n## SOC 2 Compliance Audit\n\nAs
  mentioned above, SOC 2 reports generally are internally facing documents that an
  organization is taking care and protecting data and its customers’ privacy. They
  are flexible, can be vague and subjective. However, if the SOC 2 audit is to evaluate
  regulatory compliance, flexibility and subjectivity must be removed.\n \nThe attestation
  for compliance guidelines for a SOC 2 Type 2 report are very detailed and prescriptive
  about what a report should include (see section .20 ‘Content of the Practitioner’s
  Examination Report’). To summarize briefly, the report must include:\n\n* Identification
  of the compliance matters that are being reported on\n* The time period for which
  the evaluation relates\n* An opinion on whether the compliance matters were met\n\nThe
  controls, in this case, those aligned to the trust services criteria, have been
  met for the time period specified. Typically the time period is semi-annual, for
  example, twice a year for periods of six months.\n\n## SOC 2 Penalties \n\nThere
  are no SOC 2 penalties as SOC 2 audits and reports are an analysis of internal controls,
  i.e. the competency and strength of a compliance regime. These audits are intended
  for identifying areas of risk and vulnerability for particular regulations. The
  penalties may be material in lost business opportunities. If an organization is
  in a regulated industry but hasn’t been audited by a reputable 3rd party, then it’s
  a potential red flag that the organization has risks that have not been thoroughly
  vetted and tested.\n\nOf course, the whole point of doing an internal audit like
  SOC 2 is to avoid penalties by breaking laws. If an organization is operating in
  the United States and its business involves dealing with sensitive information,
  say personal health information (PHI), it should be conducting audits to protect
  the organization. If the organization has a data breach then the penalties will
  be determined by the Department of Health and Human Services under HIPAA. Now with
  the rollout of the [EU’s new GDPR law](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/gdpr-compliance/),
  fines are much more severe than HIPAA if the organization is not properly managing
  the personal information of EU citizens.\n\n## SOC 2 Compliance + HITRUST\n\nInternal
  audits and reports, whether SOC 2 Type II or HITRUST, are a must for any organization
  operating within a regulated industry. Preparing for and undergoing internal audits
  is a best practice that management should undertake to protect the organization
  and to demonstrate trustworthiness to customers and prospects.\n\nA SOC 2 Type II
  audit using the HITRUST mapping is something that we at Datica highly recommend
  for any organization with a digital health product or service or using the public
  cloud. The CSF controls from the HITRUST Alliance have been integral to the evolution
  of Datica’s own products and services and our ability to provide compliant products
  and services to our customers. HITRUST has done a great job of aiming for big goals.
  With version 9.1 of the CSF, we believe there are few better options for the most
  stringent and comprehensive compliance auditing framework on the cloud. The HITRUST
  CSF is our DNA framework.\n\n\n"

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of
    band authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is
    responding.
  :blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
    kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
    attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from
    White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent
    one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
    more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
    ourselves.
  :post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
    and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
    organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization
    is immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the
    widespread issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of
    Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update,
    specifically [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html),
    includes important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods
    versus a single source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
    is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
    and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
    makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity
    proofing\n \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates
    out identity authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and
    authentication proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have
    the proper credentials to access a file, server, or other data containing device
    or software,” explained Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole
    question is: How do we prove John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance
    is important to Datica customers who live and breathe in an environment awash
    with protected health information. More and more the healthcare industry is affected
    by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
    that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
    ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high
    price on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n
    \nThis clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because
    that will change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an
    organization, a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the
    victim’s accounts.\n \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n
    \nThe engineering team is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to
    disallow email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to
    the problem of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
    risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected
    health information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach
    to helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
    chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why
    Datica developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    platform initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become
    HITRUST CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security
    and compliance a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica
    at hello@datica.com to arrange a quick chat about your needs and to learn more
    about how the Datica Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

    and disadvantages of this will help you wield HITRUST successfully.
  :blog_lead: One big reason HITRUST is taken so seriously is how it is composed of
    a long list of other security and risk management frameworks. HITRUST is a superset
    security framework and understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of
    this point goes a long way in understanding how to wield HITRUST successfully.

    to mold its \"Common Security Framework\" or CSF. The [HITRUST CSF](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)

    thinking about [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) as a superset framework.\n\nFirst,
    the main negative: If you become HITRUST CSF Certified, you are **not** certified
    or compliant with the above list. If you want to be SOC2 certified or PCI compliant,
    you must still conduct those assessments independently with your auditor. If your
    business is such where it's mandatory you provide those defined assurances, it
    means you have other audits to manage and pay for. That can be frustrating.\n\nBut
    there are many positives to HITRUST's superset nature. The biggest is the credibility
    and thoroughness attributed to a certification. Most compliance and security officers
    at covered entities are adopting HITRUST as the best and only required way to
    assess business associates because they know if someone is HITRUST CSF Certified,
    they have gone through a thorough process to prove assurances.\n\nThe other positive
    is the overall reduction in cost for your company to prove security and compliance.
    Again, within the framing that it's not necessarily a hard requirement to show
    PCI compliance, et al, your organization can effectively demonstrate credibility
    within those 14 frameworks in a one-time shot. We've written a case study about
    [our own HITRUST certification costs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/),
    which average somewhere around $20,000-$60,000 depending on scope.\n\nIf you are
    working on a project which requires compliance and are looking into HITRUST, consider
    us a resource. We'd be happy to chat more about the benefits of HITRUST on the
    cloud. \n\n"

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
