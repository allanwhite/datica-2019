  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: HIPAA requires that business associates and covered entities retain multiple
  types of data for at least six years. Learn what data you need to retain.
:post: |
  HIPAA requires that business associates and covered entities retain the following for at least six years from creation date or last effective date, whichever happens to be later.

  - A written or electronic record of a designation of an organization as a CE (e.g., health plan, affiliated covered entity, etc.) or BA.
  - Information security and privacy policies and procedures implemented to comply with HIPAA.
  - All documented settings, activities and assessments required by HIPAA.
  - All data use agreements and other forms supporting HIPAA compliance.
  - All signed authorizations and, where applicable, written acknowledgments of receipt of the notice or documentation of good faith efforts to obtain such written acknowledgments.
  - The Notice of Privacy Practices for entities that must provide them.
  - Designated record sets that are subject to access by individuals.
  - Documentation of the titles of the persons or offices responsible for HIPAA compliance, including not only those with over-all responsibility for compliance, but also those responsible for receiving and processing requests for amendments by individuals, and those responsible for receiving and processing requests for an accounting by individuals.
  - Accounting of disclosures of protected health information (PHI).

  In addition to understanding what HIPAA requires for retention, covered entities and business associates must also know their other legal requirements for retention, from state, federal, international and contractual requirements. For example, Connecticut state law requires that medical records, some of which go beyond HIPAA’s definition of PHI, be maintained for 7 years.

  :summary: HIPAA Security Rule standards include training workforce members. That
    means all employees and contractors of a business associate or covered entity.
  :post: |-
    There are standards within the HIPAA Security Rule to train all organization workforce members. That means all employees, as well as contractors, of a business associate  or covered entity. The rules for training two-fold - 1) providing training to new workforce members and 2) ongoing and periodic training, especially with environment or organizational changes. It's not simply a one time and done requirement.

    The content of training should also be two-fold - 1) training around HIPAA (what is PHI, when is it authorized to disclose, etc) and 2) training around information security. The first category of content deals with understanding what HIPAA is, the types of data that would meet the definition of ePHI, and the types of safeguards which are required and addressable as part of HIPAA - things like encryption, auditing, and disaster recovery. The goal should be for every employee and contractor to have an understanding of what HIPAA means, at a high level, and ideally have it be a part of the way that an organization makes operational and technical decisions.

    The other category of training relates not specifically to HIPAA, but more around training workforce members in information security best practices. It's important to understand about things like encryption from the technical perspective and from a process perspective, not necessarily for HIPAA, but so that good information security practices are something that workforce members know and follow.

    At Datica, we provide HIPAA and information security training for all new employees to assure that they know how to spell HIPAA correctly, and additionally, so that they understand the nature of the types of data that we're storing for customers, the importance of the integrity of that data, and the security and privacy related to that data. We also provide employees training on an annual basis and with weekly, what we call, Brown Bag Trainings. Those trainings always relate to either a HIPAA topic, like contingency planning or disaster recovery, or a security topic, like some specific information security topic that may not be prescriptive within HIPAA, but is really best practice. The reason we differentiate between the two categories of training is that compliance and security aren't always the same thing.

    We want security to be a part of the way that our workforce members think about technology. We want it to go into every decision that they make, and every requirement that they write, and every line of code. So that they understand not just the importance of HIPAA, not just what is PHI, but also what are the best technical practices to secure that data. We're acting as a trusted compliance partner, and an abstracted compliance and security layer for our customers, so we need security and compliance to be at the center of how we operate. We put a lot of time and energy into training to make sure that all of the technology that we provide to our customers is not just compliant, but also secure. We're planning to "open source" our training, and do more open training by using our Brown Bag Trainings as a springboard into blog posts in which others can learn.

  :summary: 'Understanding the HIPAA breach policy and having a breach notification
    checklist can prepare you in case of unauthorized disclosure of ePHI. '
  :post: |
    One of the most important aspects of HIPAA has nothing to do with technical security like encryption, backup, logging, or any of other requirements for securing data. What's important is what happens in the case of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, or a breach of ePHI. A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure that's not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

    HITECH Act Sec. 13402(b) Notification of Covered Entity by Business Associate states - A business associate of a covered entity that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured protected health information shall, following the discovery of a breach of such information, notify the covered entity of such breach. Such notice shall include the identification of each individual whose unsecured protected health information has been, or is reasonably believed by the business associate to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach.

    The majority of breaches are actually not software breaches. They're not hacking into a system that causes the unauthorized disclosures. Breaches affecting over 500 records are [published](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html) by CMS. You can see there's a searchable database of breaches that have occurred, how many records were affected and the type of breach. The vast majority of breaches are hardware breaches. The majority, if not almost all of the breaches, seem to happen because of [employee carelessness](http://rockhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/34f9a961f56ac6d3013d8b1bd266ef3b96fee194.png). It seems like it's almost always a contractor's laptop, often at the VA, that's been unencrypted and has been storing tons of patient records. The laptop is stolen from a car or a house or a coffee shop or an airport or whatever.

    "Hacking/IT Incident" only accounts for 68 breaches, a relatively small number. There is great potential to have a breach with a malicious hacker breaking into a private network or any sort of cloud storage, especially public cloud. This potential has fueled much of the slow pace of moving ePHI to the cloud.

    There are ways to mitigate that risk – and that is why we created Datica – but the important thing when it comes to a breach is actually having a process in place that details the steps to take in case of a breach. How do you assess what information was exposed in an unauthorized way and then how do you go about notifying relevant parties of that breach? The necessary notifications include anybody from the actual patient whose medical record was exposed, to the media, covered entities, and business associates. The notification policy should lay out plans for forensics to discover the extent of the breach and the cause of the breach. There is typically a chain of command that is outlined in a breach notification strategy that lays out, in detail, who is responsible for different aspects of notification and mitigation. The rules also put the burden on the business associate "of demonstrating that all notifications were made as required" by HIPAA.

    The policies should be consistent with what is in the requirements of a business associate agreement in as it relates to the timing to report a breach. HIPAA requires notification of a breach "without unreasonable delay" but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach. Most covered entities we've worked with want that timeline to be much shorter, and the range we usually hear is somewhere between 24 hours and 5 days. This can be a sticking point in business associate discussions. Some hosting providers have polices in place for breach reporting that are 30 days, 45 days, or even 60 days out; this is not typically inline with what a hospital, payer, or another large healthcare enterprise would expect from a business associate agreement and a breach policy for a business associate that they are working with. Despite the 60 day window, HIPAA rules also go on to require "evidence demonstrating the necessity of any delay." If it takes 60 days, there have to be reasons given for that delay.

    Breach policy and breach notification are things that are extremely important. There are templates for breach notification, but the policy alone does not mitigate risk. There needs to be an understanding within the organization, business associate, or covered entity of what a breach is and what the breach policy is. There also need to be auditing and logging and other systems (IDS) in place to detect and investigate a breach. Detecting the breach is often the challenge which is why having a comprehensive audit log is necessary and, more importantly, being able to generate alerts off the log is critical. Look for something from us to help you address this problem shortly.

    At Datica we have [both](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#hitech-act-and-omnibus-rule:-it-security-provisions) a breach policy and a breach checklist that we can follow in the case of a breach. We've mock tested this policy and checklist to assure it makes sense and all relevant workforce members understand their roles.

  :summary: One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program,
    including GDPR, is breach notification.
  :lead: 'One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program
    is breach notification. “Beach notification” is actually multiple tasks — survelliance,
    investigation, and ultimately notification (to end users, partner, and sometimes
    media). It is time consuming, [expensive](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3234685/data-protection/how-much-will-non-compliance-with-gdpr-cost-you.html),
    and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead to more
    investigations. '
  :post: "The 72-hour security breach requirement written into General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating a lot of attention and angst.
    72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things that organizations are used
    to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals about a breach.\n\n##
    HIPAA vs. GDPR Breach Notifications\n\nIn the case of HIPAA in the United States,
    notifying affected individuals of a breach, especially when they number in the
    thousands or even millions, can be a massively resource-intensive endeavor; it
    is also very expensive. That said, in the United States under HIPAA often individuals
    are notified weeks or months after a breach is actually discovered. This is typically
    because healthcare organizations take time to investigate the scope and cause
    of breaches, mitigate the vulnerabilities that caused the breach, and develop
    and implement a process for managing notifications.\n\nThe [HIPAA Breach Notification
    Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification) requires
    that covered entities, or the delegates of covered entities (business associates
    typically), notify individuals and Health and Human Services (HHS) “without unreasonable
    delay and in no case later than 60 days following a breach”. 60 days is a lot
    of time. Breach notification under HIPAA is often a part of a [business associates
    agreement](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (BAA) between covered entities and business associates. In many cases, we see
    breach reporting times of 30 to 60 days for cloud service providers, which aligns
    with the 60-day breach reporting requirement in HIPAA. Datica guarantees 4-hour
    breach reporting in our BAA with partners because our philosophy has always been
    to proactively notify in order to expedite discovery, containment, and notification
    to individuals while minimizing the risk to our partners; delaying notification
    to our partners exposes them to more risk, not less.\n\n## GDPR Articles 33 and
    34\n\nThe GDPR breach notification requirement, contained in [Articles 33 and
    34 of GDPR](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf)
    and [in contrast to HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/),
    states that “the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not
    later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data
    breach to the supervisory authority.” 72 hours is not a lot of time, even only
    to notify authorities and not individuals. For organizations operating in Europe
    with HIPAA-oriented policies, changes are likely required.\n\nThe first step to
    bringing your policies and procedures into compliance with GDPR is to accept that
    [GDPR breach reporting](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/) is more prescriptive
    and more aggressive than with HIPAA, or likely any other compliance frameworks
    to which you are familiar. From this first step it’s a matter of running a stringent
    process to update both your technology and organizational practices. You will
    also want to review the breach reporting obligations that your processors and
    subprocessors have in your data protection agreements. And do all that quickly
    as May 2018, the date GDPR goes into effect, is rapidly approaching.\n\n*Learn

  :summary: This GDPR data breach notification checklist outlines the steps that should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer to ensure GDPR compliance.
  :lead: The breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive
    —“The controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than
    72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the
    supervisory authority.” We discussed how this is different from [breach reporting
    requirements in HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in another Academy article. This post walks through the steps you should take
    to evaluate your breach reporting policies and procedures to bring them inline
    with GDPR.
  :post: "\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process to meet
    the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times, we’ve
    had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we went
    through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should be orchestrated
    by your data protection officer, the person at your organization who is ultimately
    responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n## Define and get consensus on what
    you mean by “breach”\n\nIt’s imperative to agree to the meaning of the term ahead
    of time, and educate your entire workforce and partners about it. Successfully
    meeting the 72-hour timeline for beach notification under GDPR requires that all
    members of your workforce are trained and activated when it comes to identifying
    a potential breach. Under GDPR, [the term “data breach” is more expansive](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)
    under GDPR  than under HIPAA, so it’s important to understand if you are complying
    with the GDPR definition before you go through the process of updating your breach
    notification processes.\n\n## Document your current process\n\nStart with your
    policies. Specifically, in regards to breach notification, these should outline
    1) the steps and 2) the responsible parties when it comes to breach notification.
    You can look at our [Datica breach policies here](https://policy.datica.com/#12-breach-policy).\nThere
    are several key things you need to identify and document:\n\n### Identify Major
    buckets of work \n\nYou don’t have to get into the details yet, but you should
    understand your broad areas of work. Examples are things like identification,
    investigation, containment, and notification (both internal and external).\n\n###
    Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n\nPerfect is the enemy of the good,
    even when it comes to compliance. To condense a set of processes down to meet
    the 72 GDPR data breach requirement successfully, there’s an incredibly high likelihood
    you will have to sequence things in new ways. Understanding the criticality is
    essential to do this. The criticality is based predominantly on the risk to your
    organization of not doing that process.\n\n### Rank each bucket of work by the
    amount of time it takes to complete\n\nFor each of the identified buckets of work,
    rank them by the amount of time they take to complete, from shortest to longest.
    Assume unlimited resources for these assessments.\n\n### Identify Key personnel\n\nIdentify
    required roles for your current process. As a part of this, pay attention to bottlenecks
    and where additional resources might be able to shorten the overall time required.\n\nIf
    this step of documenting your current process is hard to start or complete, you
    may want to quickly look for external assistance from an advisory firm that specializes
    in healthcare compliance. One of the features of GDPR is security by design and
    by default. Timely breach notification is a symptom that falls out of this underlying
    ethos, so it’s likely you need a broader revamp of your security and compliance
    programs.\n\n## Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n\nThis part is challenging because it has a degree of subjectivity.
    Now that you’ve documented your current breach process, you have to identify things
    that can be delayed until after authorities are notified. The GDPR 72 hour timeline
    isn’t for informing individuals; it’s for notifying authorities. The only way
    you’re going to be able to meet the 72 hours is by trimming part of the process.
    Since informing authorities isn't publicly disclosing a breach, some activities,
    like investigation and media strategy, can be done after authorities are notified
    of a breach. The intent of the 72-hour timeline in GDPR is likely to notify authorities
    so they can be prepared proactively and potentially assist with, notifications
    to affected individuals.\n\n## Develop the new process that can be completed in
    72 hours\n\nNow that you’ve documented the current process and made the hard decision
    about what can be delayed until after you notify authorities of a breach, you
    need to document your new process. You don’t need to list the 72-hour timeline
    for notifying authorities. You can outline this in your data protection agreements
    or contracts with customers.\n\nIn light of the GDPR requirements, our view is
    that it is prudent to have one breach notification policy and process that differentiates
    notifying authorities and notifying individuals. You can educate your workforce
    and ensure you can meet the stringent 72 hours for authorities while then doing
    additional steps before you inform individuals.\n\nBelow is a very high-level
    example breach notification process.\n\n1. Discovery\n2. Initial investigation\n3.
    Notify appropriate authorities\n4. Full investigation\n5. Risk assessment\n6.
    Risk mitigation\n7. Individual and public notification\n\n## Create templates/efficiencies\n\nConsistency
    is crucial to any compliance program. Taking the guesswork and busywork out of
    the breach reporting process by creating templates will help you move quickly,
    ideally meeting the GDPR 72 hour breach reporting requirement, and ensure repeatability.
    Templates can be used for the actual documents shared with authorities or with
    individuals. Depending on the workflow tool you’re using, you can create template
    processes in Jira or Trello or any number of project management systems. \n\n##
    Test your new process (and document it)\n\nTesting your breach reporting process,
    and documenting the results of that testing, is a requirement. There are different
    forms of testing. Initial testing should be tabletop testing. This is a form of
    testing where you, and all of the responsible parties, walk through the different
    processes, inputs, and outputs that are a part of breach reporting. You don’t
    do all the steps, but you walk through them as a group to ensure everything is
    clear.\n\nNext, you should do a full test. It doesn’t have to be a secret within
    the organization. You simply simulate the discovery a breach and follow the necessary
    steps. You can make it more complicated by keeping it a secret but, at this stage,
    there is limited value in that. Go through the process and document everything.
    When you’re done, do a retrospective. Use the feedback to inform edits the breach
    notification process.\n\n## Notify customers and partners of your new breach reporting
    process\n\nOnce you’ve created, tested, and documented the testing of your new
    GDPR-ready breach reporting process, you should inform your customers and partners.
    You want them to know that 1) GDOR is different and 2) you have ensured you comply
    with GDPR.\n\n*Learn more about GDPR—Understand the [requirements of data breach

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
