    Sciences organizations working within the confines of the FDA.

  A Business Associate is a vendor who works with a Covered Entity within the terms set forth by HIPAA. A [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), or BAA, is the contract between parties who handle Protected Health Information, or PHI.

  The intent of a BAA is to outline ownership of risk and liability as defined by HIPAA. A chain of risk is then created as BAs sign BAAs with other Subcontractor BAs.

:post: |2

  GxP does not have the concept or BAAs or contracts that outline risk. There is no concept of inheritance or chaining liability.

  The reason stems from a topic we discussed in [our GxP primer](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-gxp/): GxP isn't a government regulation with defined vocabulary or mandated procedures, like [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) or [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). Instead, GxP is an industry-accepted understanding of NIST standards adopted by the FDA in [CFR Title 21 Chapter 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/fda).

  Nowhere are BAAs or other contracts outlined. There is no risk passed down via GxP.

  Instead, when a cloud service provider, like Datica, claims GxP compliance, they are claiming that they have been audited against the interpretations of FDA guidelines. Whatever relationships that business has with its partners — like Datica with AWS or Microsoft Azure — is immaterial. For example, a customer of Datica is only concerned if Datica itself is GxP compliant; contrast this to HIPAA, where a customer of Datica is also concerned what BAA inheritance Datica has with its partners.

    GxP stands for "Good Practice" and is a set of operational controls for Life Sciences organizations working within the confines of the FDA.

    The FDA publishes its regulations on the back of NIST, which is why GxP largely follows NIST standards. There is no one authoritative documentation source for GxP, like we have the [2013 Omnibus for HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) or Articles from the European Union on [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). Instead, GxP is an industry-accepted definition of best practices mapped to FDA regulations.

    ## GxP Compliance

    In many ways, GxP is where HIPAA was mid-2000s before [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) came along. Back then, HIPAA compliance was mostly whatever someone wanted to claim it was. "HIPAA Compliance" meant one lawyer's word against another. It's why business deals took six months just to get past the "But are you HIPAA compliant?" stage. Hundreds of consultants, auditors, and lawyers defined what they believed HIPAA compliance to be, and proceeded to use that as their definition for their jobs. You can imagine why HIPAA has been a mess for a long time. This is why HITRUST is such a boon: The industry is finally agreeing to a certified definition, which accelerates the 20-year-old mating dance.

    GxP is still in that situation. There is no certifying body to GxP compliance, so it's whatever someone wants to claim it to be.

    ## eCFR — (Electronic) Code of Federal Regulations

    The basis of cloud-based GxP audits stems from [CFR Title 21 Chapter 11](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d4649e96a61f20151121c218b3fec507&mc=true&node=pt21.1.11&rgn=div5). CFR Title 21 is intended for the FDA, and Chapter 11 scopes to electronic records. When a cloud services provider—like Datica—claims to be GxP compliant, the company is claiming that they were audited against an interpretation of CFR Title 21 Chapter 11.

    The bulk of the controls in a GxP audit are administrative and not technical. Whereas HIPAA, and HITRUST in particular, get very deep in the weeds of encryption, intrusion detection, and so on, GxP focuses mostly at processes and procedures to ensure quality.
