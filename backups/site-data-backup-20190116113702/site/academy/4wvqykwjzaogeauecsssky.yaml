  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules changed
  in late 2013 with the new HIPAA Omnibus that adds subcontractors entities.
:post: |-
  Our mission is to help developers build health apps and technology. Specifically we want to offer tools and services to deal with the security and data challenges in healthcare. The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules changed in late 2013 in ways that we've been planning for at Datica. The new HIPAA Omnibus ("omnibus" means something with several volumes or chapters, I didn't know that so I looked it up and thought I'd share) rules that went into effect on 9/23, amongst other changes, created a category of entities called subcontractors.

  Previously HIPAA rules only defined two categories of entities - covered entities and business associates. Covered entities are basically providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Business associates are basically entities that work with covered entities to perform a service or services to store, transmit, and/or process PHI. The new HIPAA rules expanded the number of categories of entities by 50% with the addition of subcontractors; for those of us in health tech, we think this is a pretty big deal.

  Subcontractors are entities that business associates use to process, create, or store PHI. Subcontractors don't have business associate agreements, or really any direct relationships, with covered entities; but, starting 9/23/2013, theses subcontractors need to have business associate agreements (BAAs) with business associates. It's all very obvious and confusing at the same time. Essentially you can think of subcontractors as a business associate of a business associate.

  The best examples of subcontractors we can think of are hosted services providers like Amazon Web Services, Datica, and Rackspace. Datica is a subcontractor for some of our customers and, as such, we do sign BAAs. We also act as a business associate directly for covered entities like enterprises, and sign BAAs in this capacity as well. We offer the same API-based services for developers in both circumstances, but the relationship is slightly different in the eyes of HIPAA.

  At Datica we know that subcontractors, as defined by HIPAA, have existed for a long time. As more health apps and services have shifted to hosted, or cloud based, and more infrastructure tools (app dev, logging, analytics, data collections, etc) have become mainstream, covered entities and business associates have begun to rely on "subcontractors". The new HIPAA rules now mean those subcontractors need to work with business associates to assure all parties are covered in terms of liability.

  This is a very exciting and major shift for health tech. HIPAA has finally acknowledged subcontractors and the role they play in creating, processing, and transmitting PHI. That's important for health tech to build smart, scalable, and interoperable tools. As a developer in healthcare, if you're considering acting as a business associate, or selling services to a covered entity, you need to understand if you fit into a certain entity category as defined by HIPAA.

  We encourage you to read the rest of the new [rules](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/01/20130117b.html), or at least one of the commentaries that covers them in more detail, to see about the other changes that are a part of the Omnibus rule. If you have any questions related to the new rules, where you potentially fit, and how we can help you mitigate your risk, shoot us an [email](mailto:hello@datica.io).

  :summary: HIPAA Security Rule standards include training workforce members. That
    means all employees and contractors of a business associate or covered entity.
  :post: |-
    There are standards within the HIPAA Security Rule to train all organization workforce members. That means all employees, as well as contractors, of a business associate  or covered entity. The rules for training two-fold - 1) providing training to new workforce members and 2) ongoing and periodic training, especially with environment or organizational changes. It's not simply a one time and done requirement.

    The content of training should also be two-fold - 1) training around HIPAA (what is PHI, when is it authorized to disclose, etc) and 2) training around information security. The first category of content deals with understanding what HIPAA is, the types of data that would meet the definition of ePHI, and the types of safeguards which are required and addressable as part of HIPAA - things like encryption, auditing, and disaster recovery. The goal should be for every employee and contractor to have an understanding of what HIPAA means, at a high level, and ideally have it be a part of the way that an organization makes operational and technical decisions.

    The other category of training relates not specifically to HIPAA, but more around training workforce members in information security best practices. It's important to understand about things like encryption from the technical perspective and from a process perspective, not necessarily for HIPAA, but so that good information security practices are something that workforce members know and follow.

    At Datica, we provide HIPAA and information security training for all new employees to assure that they know how to spell HIPAA correctly, and additionally, so that they understand the nature of the types of data that we're storing for customers, the importance of the integrity of that data, and the security and privacy related to that data. We also provide employees training on an annual basis and with weekly, what we call, Brown Bag Trainings. Those trainings always relate to either a HIPAA topic, like contingency planning or disaster recovery, or a security topic, like some specific information security topic that may not be prescriptive within HIPAA, but is really best practice. The reason we differentiate between the two categories of training is that compliance and security aren't always the same thing.

    We want security to be a part of the way that our workforce members think about technology. We want it to go into every decision that they make, and every requirement that they write, and every line of code. So that they understand not just the importance of HIPAA, not just what is PHI, but also what are the best technical practices to secure that data. We're acting as a trusted compliance partner, and an abstracted compliance and security layer for our customers, so we need security and compliance to be at the center of how we operate. We put a lot of time and energy into training to make sure that all of the technology that we provide to our customers is not just compliant, but also secure. We're planning to "open source" our training, and do more open training by using our Brown Bag Trainings as a springboard into blog posts in which others can learn.

  :summary: With ePHI access, business associates are required to sign a HIPAA business
    associate agreement (BAA). Learn more about business associate agreements here.
  :post: |-
    The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of cloud computing companies.

    Business associates are people or organizations who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required to sign what's called a business associate agreement (BAA). Below is the actual language from HIPAA 164.308.

    * (b)(1) Business associate contracts and other arrangements. A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity's behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

    * (2) A business associate may permit a business associate that is a **subcontractor** to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on its behalf only if the business associate obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the subcontractor will appropriately safeguard the information.

    Business associate agreements are basically legal contracts that outline the ways in which business associates follow HIPAA, as well as the responsibilities and risks that the business associate takes on. They typically defines the type of services that the business associate is providing, the type of data that they are interacting with, states that they will follow HIPAA and not disclose PHI without authorization. They also should address areas around breach notifications and penalties. Traditionally, pre-cloud and prior to the HIPAA Omnibus changes of 2013, BAAs were boiler plate. Here's the [template BAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/contractprov.html) from HHS.

    Business associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon that definition of business associate to include something called subcontractors. Subcontractors are typically service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for the covered entities. With subcontractors and APIs and SaaS, there is now a chain of entities touching ePHI in some way, and each of them need to have BAAs in place that are consistent and not contradictory to one another. As an example, a business associate selling to hospital A can't have a breach notification policy of less than 24 hours if the hosting provider they use has a physical breach notification policy of 2 months.

    As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos, more and more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, considered subcontractors. These subcontractors have to sign business associate agreements with business associates, who in turn have to sign a business associate agreement with covered entities. That's actually a very common use case for us at Datica, where most of our early customers are business associates, and their customers are covered entities.

    We spent a lot of time and a lot of money with our attorneys on our BAAs because this is a new area, an area we don't think is well defined yet; we don't think the existing BAA templates are adequate or even make sense for most hosted vendors. In this new paradigm of health technology there are interesting definitions around which entities are responsible, both technically and financially in the case of a breach, for different aspects of the HIPAA rules. We tell our prospective customers to read their current business associated agreements that they have with their hosting providers or other services companies to get a sense of what the legal responsibility is for the business associate and the aspects to which the subcontractor is ultimately. Regardless of who is issuing the BAA, you should read through it in detail because at some point a compliance or security officer likely will read it and you want to be as proactive about compliance issues as you can.

    If you boil it down, business associate agreements are just contracts that outline the ways in which different organizations are going to handle electronic protected health information (ePHI), the types of responsibilities that those organizations take on, some of the very specific rules around their obligations with regards to HIPAA. This last one, the obligations of subcontractors, is an area in which you want to pay close attention. Specifically read what the subcontractors obligations are in terms of timeliness of breach notification, because that was a part of the changes in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule that just went into effect. We have had several early customers come to us because the time period for breach notifications with their existing hosting provider is not acceptable for covered entities they are selling into. We've talked to several companies that have run into roadblocks with enterprises because their business associate agreements with their hosting providers had been out of line, and especially relating to breach notification. Our policy at Datica is breach notification within 4 hours, along with some very detailed [plans](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#notification-in-the-case-of-breach---13402(a)-and-13402(b)) to help you mitigate the risk of a breach.

    At a high level, that's what business associate agreements are and you are expected to have those for all of the various technology and services companies that you work with that might in some way interact, process, store, or have access to ePHI. If you're a business associate or you're a covered entity, we happily sign BAAs. And if you're interested in seeing one of our BAAs, [email us](mailto:legal@datica.com) and we'll walk you through ours and answer any questions you might have about it.

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first

    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
