  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: With ePHI access, business associates are required to sign a HIPAA business
  associate agreement (BAA). Learn more about business associate agreements here.
:post: |-
  The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of cloud computing companies.

  Business associates are people or organizations who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required to sign what's called a business associate agreement (BAA). Below is the actual language from HIPAA 164.308.

  * (b)(1) Business associate contracts and other arrangements. A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity's behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

  * (2) A business associate may permit a business associate that is a **subcontractor** to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on its behalf only if the business associate obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the subcontractor will appropriately safeguard the information.

  Business associate agreements are basically legal contracts that outline the ways in which business associates follow HIPAA, as well as the responsibilities and risks that the business associate takes on. They typically defines the type of services that the business associate is providing, the type of data that they are interacting with, states that they will follow HIPAA and not disclose PHI without authorization. They also should address areas around breach notifications and penalties. Traditionally, pre-cloud and prior to the HIPAA Omnibus changes of 2013, BAAs were boiler plate. Here's the [template BAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/contractprov.html) from HHS.

  Business associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon that definition of business associate to include something called subcontractors. Subcontractors are typically service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for the covered entities. With subcontractors and APIs and SaaS, there is now a chain of entities touching ePHI in some way, and each of them need to have BAAs in place that are consistent and not contradictory to one another. As an example, a business associate selling to hospital A can't have a breach notification policy of less than 24 hours if the hosting provider they use has a physical breach notification policy of 2 months.

  As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos, more and more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, considered subcontractors. These subcontractors have to sign business associate agreements with business associates, who in turn have to sign a business associate agreement with covered entities. That's actually a very common use case for us at Datica, where most of our early customers are business associates, and their customers are covered entities.

  We spent a lot of time and a lot of money with our attorneys on our BAAs because this is a new area, an area we don't think is well defined yet; we don't think the existing BAA templates are adequate or even make sense for most hosted vendors. In this new paradigm of health technology there are interesting definitions around which entities are responsible, both technically and financially in the case of a breach, for different aspects of the HIPAA rules. We tell our prospective customers to read their current business associated agreements that they have with their hosting providers or other services companies to get a sense of what the legal responsibility is for the business associate and the aspects to which the subcontractor is ultimately. Regardless of who is issuing the BAA, you should read through it in detail because at some point a compliance or security officer likely will read it and you want to be as proactive about compliance issues as you can.

  If you boil it down, business associate agreements are just contracts that outline the ways in which different organizations are going to handle electronic protected health information (ePHI), the types of responsibilities that those organizations take on, some of the very specific rules around their obligations with regards to HIPAA. This last one, the obligations of subcontractors, is an area in which you want to pay close attention. Specifically read what the subcontractors obligations are in terms of timeliness of breach notification, because that was a part of the changes in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule that just went into effect. We have had several early customers come to us because the time period for breach notifications with their existing hosting provider is not acceptable for covered entities they are selling into. We've talked to several companies that have run into roadblocks with enterprises because their business associate agreements with their hosting providers had been out of line, and especially relating to breach notification. Our policy at Datica is breach notification within 4 hours, along with some very detailed [plans](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#notification-in-the-case-of-breach---13402(a)-and-13402(b)) to help you mitigate the risk of a breach.

  At a high level, that's what business associate agreements are and you are expected to have those for all of the various technology and services companies that you work with that might in some way interact, process, store, or have access to ePHI. If you're a business associate or you're a covered entity, we happily sign BAAs. And if you're interested in seeing one of our BAAs, [email us](mailto:legal@datica.com) and we'll walk you through ours and answer any questions you might have about it.

  :summary: The HIPAA Security Rule describes the ways in which electronic protected
    health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected.
  :post: |
    The HIPAA Security Rule operationalizes many of the standards set out in the Privacy Rule. Specifically the Security Rule spells out, in various levels of detail, the ways in which electronic protected health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected. The Security Rule, despite setting implementation specifications, isn’t all that specific most of the time.

    The Security Rule is the section of HIPAA that gets most talked about by vendors like us and others with a background in technology. Many times developers and vendors focus specifically on the areas within the Security Rule to achieve compliance. Even with this area of focus, the specific technical controls only make up a minority of the HIPAA Security Rule.

    The HIPAA Security Rule can be broken down into the three main categories below.

    ### Administrative

    This is actually the largest category of safeguards in the HIPAA Security Rule, accounting for more than 50% of the rule. These are not server setting or specifics around technology, they are policies and processes that need to be followed to safeguard data. The biggest, and most important, area covered in this section, at least for people starting out on the journey towards compliance, is the risk assessment. A risk assessment should be the first step for most organizations wanting to be compliant, and covers documenting architecture, identifying risks related to the protection of PHI, and mitigating those risks.

    When you use Datica, we cover much of risk environment for you as we manage many aspects of the architecture. We work with you to define areas that you need to address in terms of risk, and will work closely with you if and when you decide to go forward with a full audit.

    There are other areas in this category including workforce security, contingency planning, training, and a few others, all of which are necessary to examine and address, but the risk assessment is really the big one in this category.

    ### Physical

    This category is easy to understand as it’s the physical aspect of securing systems that have access to ePHI. It breaks out to workstations, facilities, and different portable and mobile media. Most data centers today, including the ones that we use at Datica, more than meet the requirements in the HIPAA Security Rule for facilities. Typically compliant Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) vendors, like AWS and Firehost, cover this category of HIPAA for you.

    Areas people sometimes neglect are office security and workstation security. These aren’t hard safeguards to meet but they likely involve some process changes, like not allowing cleaning people into your office without supervision, keeping doors locked and tracking visitors, encrypting employee computers, and using workstation firewalls. We control and monitor access at our offices using a smart lock from Lockitron, which provides a nice log of all access.

    ### Technical

    The technical category of safeguards is usually what people think of when they think of securing ePHI. The biggest areas are encryption, access controls, and auditing. With encryption, it has to be end to end, and it has to be at rest. At rest is typically harder. We have found that we need to use high performance SSD drives to improve performance issues that arise with encrypting data at rest.

    For access controls and logging, basically all activity of servers should be logged and those logs should be monitored with appropriate alerting. All API calls should also be logged, including what was accessed (with ePHI at times), by whom, and when. We have spent a lot of time building a powerful and flexible unified logging solution to meet the requirements in this area.

    Beyond the three areas above, there are a few miscellaneous requirements in the security rule. Those additional requirements relate to signing business associate agreements and having policies to, well, manage your policies.

    That's a very high-level overview of the HIPAA Security Rule. You can see pretty detailed information about the Security Rule, and how we address the different specifications, on our HIPAA page.

  :summary: 'HIPAA attestation is everywhere but are they really compliant? Companies
    can self-attest to HIPAA compliance because there are no HIPAA certifications. '
  :post: "> I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger
    to my father. He said he wanted more proof. - Rodney Dangerfield\n\nAnybody can,
    and many companies do, put \"HIPAA Compliant\" on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to [selling software](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/whitepapers/making-enterprise-healthcare-sales-easier/)
    that processes, stores, transmits, or somehow touches [ePHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/).
    It's an essential, though non-differentiating, feature of any B2B healthcare technology
    product. The reason companies can self-attest to being HIPAA compliant is that
    there isn't a certifying body, or accompanying certification, for HIPAA. That's
    problematic for both _vendors_ making and selling healthcare software to enterprises
    and _enterprises_ buying software from third party vendors. Let's talk briefly
    about those two camps.\n\n* **Vendors.** Compliance is a challenge because vendors
    constantly answer the same questions over and over again, though often phrased
    differently or in different formats (word docs vs spreadsheets). They often must
    provide different forms of evidence for each of these reviews. Not having evidence,
    or not having validated (externally audited) evidence, can slow the process and
    extend sales and implementation cycles.\n\n* **Enterprises.** Compliance is problematic
    for enterprises because they need to collect and review different forms of evidence
    and responses to questions from vendors. This takes time, does not typically leave
    security and compliance groups with lots of confidence since the evidence is so
    scattered and largely self-attested. Angst is often created between business buyers
    and compliance groups.\n\nThe end result is an inefficient process of security
    and compliance reviews where vendors and enterprises essentially reinvent the
    wheel for every new relationship. It's akin to how EHR integrations work today
    in that every new contract for a vendor or enterprise is like creating a new point-to-point
    relationship. Similarly, it can be a big stumbling block for vendors, especially
    smaller ones that have a hard time absorbing the cost of longer sales cycles.\n\n\n##
    HIPAA vs PCI\n\nThe financial industry, in contrast to healthcare, created a standardized
    certification for processing financial transactions or storing financial data.
    The [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2-0#pci_dss_v2-0)
    is a set of rules and requirements that can be tested, with passing resulting
    in certification to process financial transactions. Financial organizations and
    vendors work with a [qualified security assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php)
    in order to be certified. As opposed to HIPAA, organizations cannot self-attest
    to being \"PCI Compliant.\"\n\nThe reason for the differences between the financial
    industry (PCI) and the healthcare industry (HIPAA) is that PCI was created and
    is maintained by the private sector. If you look at who governs PCI, it's almost
    all the [large financial institutions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/organization_info/executive-committee.php).
    Essentially PCI is self-governing. HIPAA, in contrast, was created and is maintained
    by Health and Human Services (HHS), a government agency responsible for many different
    areas of healthcare. HIPAA is [interpreted and enforced](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/whos-really-interpreting-and-enforcing-hipaa-for-startups/)
    by non-government organizations and not HHS.\n\nChange is coming in healthcare
    that will make HIPAA more like PCI. The changes are represented in the new compliance
    framework and certification called [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).\n\nHITRUST,
    like PCI, is [governed by a board made up of large private sector healthcare organizations](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/)
    like Anthem and United Healthcare. HITRUST maintains the [Common Security Framework
    (CSF)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/), which is
    essentially a PCI DSS for healthcare and HIPAA. Similarly to PCI, HITRUST CSF
    Certifications are granted to organizations that complete the CSF, have the results
    validated by an [approved third party assessor](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/),
    and then are verified by HITRUST itself. The resulting form of evidence is a certification
    and standard report. Datica has been through the HITRUST process and is awaiting
    final verification from HITRUST.\n\n\n## How to Prove HIPAA Compliance\n\nDifferent
    paths can lead to HIPAA compliance. To be clear, we're talking about proving compliance
    with HIPAA as part of an enterprise (payer and provider system) deployment. We've
    outlined a couple of options below. We have personal experience with each path,
    and have Datica customers that fit into each, so we feel confident discussing
    the pros and cons of each.\n\n\n### Path 1 - Self Assessments\n\nThe first option
    does not require third party verification or auditing. Not shockingly, self assessments
    are the easiest and least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show
    compliance with HIPAA.\n\nDownsides proliferate, however. The inspiration that
    led to the formation of Datica was based on our experience trying to sell modern,
    cloud based software as part of a previous venture; it's also important to note
    this was just before the new HIPAA Omnibus Rules went into effect in late 2013.
    We were selling to large healthcare enterprises (mostly academic - UCSF, University
    of Colorado, etc) and trying to prove compliance with HIPAA based on our own assessment.
    We were spending the majority of our time configuring our technology and updating
    our policies and internal procedures in order to deploy our technology and complete
    sales. All that time, effort, and work was going into things that our users would
    never see or appreciate. It's the reason we built Datica and the reason we [open
    sourced our policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).\n\n\n####
    Supporting Documentation\n\nWithout official audit reports you must illustrate
    your compliance story through hand-crafted documentation. You can simply respond
    to compliance questionnaires with specific technical settings, but you may also
    have to provide some form of proof (like screenshots of settings or links to policies).\n\nA
    better approach is to use some type of framework to pre-compile answers to questions
    around HIPAA. The best framework to use is the [Audit Program Protocol](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/protocol.html)
    from OCR (part of HHS). Companies complete this framework to at minimum identify
    existing gaps before talking to compliance officers. Another option is to complete
    the [Common Security Framework (CSF)](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/)
    from HITRUST. This is more involved and takes more time than the OCR framework
    but provides a standardized report (not a spreadsheet you created yourself for
    the OCR framework). Self-assessing with HITRUST also has a cost, whereas the OCR
    framework is free.\n\nBe prepared to answer many questions. You will need both
    technology settings and policies to prove compliance. You need to assure technology
    (things like backup and DR) and internal procedures (things like training) are
    in line.\n\nWe've been through [multiple third party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    at Datica. Based on that experience, we discovered transparency and proactive
    approaches to HIPAA have value for everyone. We decided to publish our [policies](https://policy.datica.com/)
    and our [mappings to HIPAA](https://hipaa.datica.com/). The HIPAA page is very
    close to a web page representation of the OCR audit framework linked above. If
    you're interested in leveraging our design for these pages, please [let us know](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to provide you with the code to host it yourself. Also, both
    our policy page and HIPAA page are dynamically generated by Github repos, which
    serve as the master source and provide a great form of version control (good for
    an audit). Our policies are written in Markdown for simplicity.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Less upfront time and effort\n* Lower cost\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* Can derail (or drastically
    slow) sales process\n* A lot more effort during the sales process (it will require
    a lot more time learning about HIPAA to respond to questions)\n\n\n### Path 2
    - Full third party audits\n\nAudits are not fun. Audits are not cheap. \n\nIn
    a previous life, Datica's CEO, [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/),
    conducted technology assessments for HIPAA audits in addition to Datica completing
    three external audits. We feel we have a good understanding of the process and
    value. Despite the effort and cost, audits are the single best way to streamline
    the security and compliance portion of the sales process.\n\nWe fully realize
    audits aren't an option for many smaller organizations. We are often asked \"when
    should I do an audit?\" and \"do I have to do an audit to close a deal?\" The
    answer to the latter question is an emphatic _No_, you don't have to do an audit
    to close a deal with a healthcare enterprise. The answer to the former is harder
    to answer. Of current non-enterprise Datica customers, less than 5% have done
    external audits (we think this is fantastic, actually).\n\nVendors typically do
    audits once they have about 4-5 enterprises customers. At this point companies
    shift to scaling sales based on lessons learned from early reference customers.
    It may have taken 12-24 months to acquire the initial 4-5 customers; acquiring
    the next 8-10 customers must be faster. Scaling sales means adding more sales
    agents, many of which won't have the same experience selling and answering questions
    about security and compliance; in this context, audit reports are empowering to
    sales people. Also, organizations with 4-5 customers typically have more resources.
    All those factors seem to push vendors over the tipping point of doing an external
    audit. The audit is a tool to help vendors accelerate and scale sales efforts.
    Maybe the best way to answer the question around when to do an audit is to say
    that doing an audit makes sense when security and compliance is the main bottleneck
    for sales.\n\n\n#### Supporting Documentation\n\nWhile you may still have to answer
    questions from each customer about security and compliance, providing your audit
    reports will go a long way to circumventing long, drawn out security and compliance
    reviews. On many occasions, you may only get asked about gaps that exist in your
    audit reports. Oftentimes those gaps will have associated remediation plans and
    you may get asked if gaps have been remediated. In essence, you've proven compliance
    to third party auditors so there's a lower burden of proof for your customers.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Speeds up sales process\n* Puts less of a burden on internal resources (sales
    and tech) to be well versed in HIPAA\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* It's expensive and time consuming\n*
    They do become out of date so need to assure you revisit, likely annually\n\n\n####
    Types of audits\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance
    frameworks that you can be audited against:\n\n1. HIPAA (from HHS)\n2. HITRUST\n\nWe've
    done both at Datica. We started with HIPAA, as our auditors recommended, and then
    moved on to HITRUST. We began with a HIPAA gap assessment, which most auditing
    firms will recommend if it's your first audit. Basically a gap assessment is lighter
    weight in terms of verifying things and is meant to, as the name implies, identify
    gaps in your compliance and security programs when mapping those programs to HIPAA
    rules. Once you know the gaps you can address them, or mitigate them if they can't
    be addressed for some reason. From there, a full HIPAA audit is a lot easier and
    holds a much higher chance of success.\n\nOnce we'd completed our gap assessment,
    addressed our gaps, and then completed our HIPAA audit, we did our HITRUST audit.
    The official term for that a Validated HITRUST Assessment. We opted to complete
    the HITRUST assessment because:\n\n1. More enterprises were asking about it\n2.
    A strong security and compliance program and culture at Datica is important\n3.
    It is a valuable tool for our customers in their sales process\n\nAs opposed to
    HIPAA audits, which are somewhat customized by each auditing firm, HITRUST has
    created one framework (the CSF linked above) that all entities are assessed against.
    It doesn't matter if you're small or large, the framework is the same. Some variability
    exists around the scope of a HITRUST audit as there are certain aspects of security
    and compliance that apply to some organizations and not others. HITRUST also has
    the concept of risk levels which determine the extent of questions organizations
    need to answer and prove. The bank of questions and resulting report are standardized.
    It is a true certification, as opposed to HIPAA.\n\nFor us, the HITRUST assessment
    involved two site visits and completing 278 different question areas. Each question
    area required attestation of 5 different maturity levels and each maturity level
    required some form of justification and/or proof. Also, many questions required
    additional comments to add context and specificity for how the question area fit
    with Datica. Taking out the comments and back and forth as HITRUST and our auditors
    reviewed our responses, that's just under 7,000 responses. Completing the 7,000
    HITRUST entries was made more painful by the incredibly slow (think spinning pinwheel)
    response times in the CSF web app.\n\nOther certification-type frameworks exist,
    like the [DIRECT certification](http://www.directtrust.org/becoming-accredited/)
    and Meaningful Use. These can be used as a proxy for an audit, as they do assess
    certain aspects of security and compliance programs, but these don't hold as much
    weight as HIPAA or HITRUST audits.\n\n#### Cost of an audit\n\nCost is a common
    question. This is too broad a topic to completely cover here because the [real
    cost of audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) involves more than the
    direct cost. For example, try to estimate the cost of completing 7,000 entries
    in a slow web app for a sense of the indirect costs.\n\nMost want to know the
    direct costs, which is easier to compute. From our experience, and those of customers
    and contacts at other modern tech vendors, the average cost of audits is about
    $20,000 for a HIPAA gap assessment, $20,000-$25,000 for a full HIPAA audit, and
    $30,000-$35,000 for a Validated HITRUST Assessment (includes both auditor's fees
    the the licensing fee to HITRUST). Variability exists from audit firm to audit
    firm but these prices are consistently what we hear.\n\n\n### Path 3 - Middle
    Road: Inheriting Proof\n\nIf you've gotten this far, chances are neither Path
    1 or 2 above appeal to you. Path 1 is easy but can kill sales. Path 2 is expensive,
    extremely time consuming, and you might run out of money before you start selling.
    We've been in your shoes. When we sat down as a team and decided to build Datica,
    pivoting out of our previous venture, neither Path 1 or 2 seemed terribly appealing
    to us.\n\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier way to
    build modern healthcare technology, practice modern development practices, comply
    with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert, and to prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nAs technology has evolved and computing
    has become distributed, driven largely by easy-to-use cloud platforms and APIs,
    different requirements of HIPAA are getting distributed across partner organizations.
    It's why HHS expanded who is covered under HIPAA to include [subcontractors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-subcontractors-and-baas/).
    Covered entities work with business associates who in turn work with one to many
    subcontractors. In this brave new world, certain requirements under HIPAA are
    inherited by business associates from their subcontractors.\n\nThe industry has
    proven our early assumptions. Many customers utilize our audit reports, policy
    page, and HIPAA mappings as the cornerstone of their compliance programs. These
    resources, collectively what we refer to as a **HIPAA Sales Package**, are a core
    part of the value that we provide to our customers. We've spent 1,000s of hours
    on security and compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training,
    etc) and $10,000s on audits so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our
    customers inherit our work and our expertise, making compliance and trust a core
    part of their products. In fact, several of our customers have told us they've
    delayed audits because they leverage Datica.\n\nWhen our customers do decide to
    go down the path of doing a full audit, we help them in the process and make it
    less time consuming for them. Since we've been through multiple HIPAA and HITRUST
    audits, our customers give their auditors our documentation and audit reports
    to show evidence of certain aspects of HIPAA. \n\nHow is Path 3 different from
    Path 1 and other compliant cloud options? If you've built and configured your
    own technology on a traditional hosting vendor like AWS, you're going to have
    to prove every aspect of HIPAA compliance. You can point to the hosting vendors
    SOC2 (other audit reports) and BAA, but those only a address a small subset of
    the HIPAA rules like physical security. All other aspects of HIPAA, from a technical
    perspective, is yours to prove. The same goes for the admin side of HIPAA, though
    this is typically less important to security and compliance groups that the technical
    rules. With Path 3, we offer a fully audited platform and address more of HIPAA
    than any other option.\n\n\n## Choices, choices, choices\n\nIn the end, the path
    you choose to prove HIPAA is up to you and will be driven by your available resources,
    both financial and human. We've focused here more on the technical requirements
    of HIPAA, but the administrative side is also relevant. Completely addressing
    both the technical and administrative side of is necessary to proving compliance
    with HIPAA.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how we can help with
    the technical aspects of HIPAA, don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com).
    If you have specific questions about any of this, please let us know and we'd
    be happy to respond."

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

    changed in late 2013 with the new HIPAA Omnibus that adds subcontractors entities.
  :post: |-
    Our mission is to help developers build health apps and technology. Specifically we want to offer tools and services to deal with the security and data challenges in healthcare. The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules changed in late 2013 in ways that we've been planning for at Datica. The new HIPAA Omnibus ("omnibus" means something with several volumes or chapters, I didn't know that so I looked it up and thought I'd share) rules that went into effect on 9/23, amongst other changes, created a category of entities called subcontractors.

    Previously HIPAA rules only defined two categories of entities - covered entities and business associates. Covered entities are basically providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Business associates are basically entities that work with covered entities to perform a service or services to store, transmit, and/or process PHI. The new HIPAA rules expanded the number of categories of entities by 50% with the addition of subcontractors; for those of us in health tech, we think this is a pretty big deal.

    Subcontractors are entities that business associates use to process, create, or store PHI. Subcontractors don't have business associate agreements, or really any direct relationships, with covered entities; but, starting 9/23/2013, theses subcontractors need to have business associate agreements (BAAs) with business associates. It's all very obvious and confusing at the same time. Essentially you can think of subcontractors as a business associate of a business associate.

    The best examples of subcontractors we can think of are hosted services providers like Amazon Web Services, Datica, and Rackspace. Datica is a subcontractor for some of our customers and, as such, we do sign BAAs. We also act as a business associate directly for covered entities like enterprises, and sign BAAs in this capacity as well. We offer the same API-based services for developers in both circumstances, but the relationship is slightly different in the eyes of HIPAA.

    At Datica we know that subcontractors, as defined by HIPAA, have existed for a long time. As more health apps and services have shifted to hosted, or cloud based, and more infrastructure tools (app dev, logging, analytics, data collections, etc) have become mainstream, covered entities and business associates have begun to rely on "subcontractors". The new HIPAA rules now mean those subcontractors need to work with business associates to assure all parties are covered in terms of liability.

    This is a very exciting and major shift for health tech. HIPAA has finally acknowledged subcontractors and the role they play in creating, processing, and transmitting PHI. That's important for health tech to build smart, scalable, and interoperable tools. As a developer in healthcare, if you're considering acting as a business associate, or selling services to a covered entity, you need to understand if you fit into a certain entity category as defined by HIPAA.

    We encourage you to read the rest of the new [rules](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/01/20130117b.html), or at least one of the commentaries that covers them in more detail, to see about the other changes that are a part of the Omnibus rule. If you have any questions related to the new rules, where you potentially fit, and how we can help you mitigate your risk, shoot us an [email](mailto:hello@datica.io).

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
