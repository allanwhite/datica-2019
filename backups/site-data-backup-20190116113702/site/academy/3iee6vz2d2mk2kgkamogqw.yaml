  :description: General company-related content.
:summary: High performance scores and ratings can be a strategic advantage over competitors.
  Understand MIPS, including qualifiers, scoring, and threshholds.
:post: "The scoring in MIPS is based on a composite score across four dimensions,
  summarized as:\n\n- Quality: based on Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)\n-
  Resource Use: based on Value-Based Modifier (VBM)\n- ACI (Advancing Clinical Information):
  based on Meaningful Use (MU) and \n- Clinical Practice Improvement Activities (CPIA):
  a new fourth category. \n\nThe scoring is out of maximum of a 100, but the formulas
  are not initially intuitive.\n\nEach performance category (PQRS/VMB, ACI, RU and
  CPIA) is scored separately as a percentage of maximum possible performance within
  that category. The category-level scores are then weighted by the appropriate category
  weight and then summed up, i.e\n\n> 50% x PQRS + 25% x ACI + 15% x CPIA + 10% x
  RU = CPS. \n\nIt is interesting to note that given this weightage and the way the
  scoring works within each category, physicians who have historically performed well
  under MU and avoided PQRS and VBM penalties may not have high enough ACI or MIPS
  Quality scores to avoid MIPS penalties. MIPS forces historically high performers
  to re-evaluate their performance status under MIPS, given how the MIPS scoring system
  differs from those of MU, PQRS and VBM. As a quick example, if eight measures were
  to be used in the quality category (and they are and all drawn from PQRS and VBM)
  and each earned eight points each, then the total points would be 8 x 8 = 64 out
  of a possible 80 points, or a 64/80 = 80%. But as the Quality category for the CY2017
  performance year has a weight of 50%, then a quality score of 80% would result in
  the Quality category contributing 80% x 50% x 100 = 40 points to the clinician’s
  overall CPS.\n\nNow let's consider the fact that the score obtained will be compared
  against *all other qualified*—i.e. MIPS eligible physicians—for a previous performance
  period. Based on a sample comparative chart published [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/09/2016-10032/medicare-program-merit-based-incentive-payment-system-mips-and-alternative-payment-model-apm#h-78),
  if each of those above PQRS measure is only better than 60% of peers reflected in
  the benchmark, then that measure would earn only earn 7 out of 10 possible points,
  i.e. the overall score calculated above would now drop to 70% x 50% x 100 = 35 points.\n\n###
  Scoring in the Quality Category\n\nMIPS essentially adopts the quality measures
  and reporting methods from the PQRS and VBM programs. Although there are some changes
  to the PQRS reporting methods, for the most part the quality reporting methods remain
  the same.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. **Select a minimum of six PQRS
  measures, across any combination of quality domains**: Constraints are that one
  measure is a cross-domain measure if the clinician is patient-facing, and one measure
  is an outcome measure (or a high priority measure, if an outcome measure is unavailable).
  These measures can be drawn from the EHR, Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR)
  and registry reporting methods. \n2. **CMS will calculate 2 or 3 cohort based claims
  quality measures**: Two for individual clinicians and groups with less than 10 clinicians
  and three for groups with 10+ clinicians. This compares peer groups with each other
  and can have an additional impact on scoring.\n3. **Bonus points**: MIPS also provides
  additional paths to achieve a quality score of 100% by granting bonus points for
  certain quality reporting activities. So if two bonus points were earned in the
  earlier example, then the quality score would increase to (64+2)/80 = 82.5%, resulting
  in 82.5% x 50% x 100 = 41.25 CPS points. \n\n### Scoring in the Advancing Care Information
  (ACI) Category\n\nMIPS changes MU (renamed to ACI) from an all-or-nothing compliance
  program to a continuous scoring system where MU measure rates are compared to benchmarks
  in much the same way as described for the MIPS Quality category described above.\n\nFor
  example, currently, if a clinician in the existing MU program achieves a performance
  rate of 15% on an MU measure with a compliance threshold of 10%, then that clinician
  is just as compliant with MU as another who achieves a 90% rate on the same measure.
  However, under the ACI scoring system, the former will only earn two out of 10 performance
  points, whereas the latter will earn 10 out of 10 points, according to the decile
  measure scoring scale. This explains why a historically high MU achiever may end
  up having a low ACI score if MU performance rates do not improve.\n\nThe process
  works as follows:\n\n> 1. **Base score**:  The ACI category defines 131 ACI performance
  points that can be earned. 50 points are earned for reporting either a non-zero
  numerator or a “yes,” as applicable for measures selected. The ACI percentage score
  is calculated by dividing the number of ACI points by 100 and capping the percentage
  at 100%, should more than 100 ACI points be earned. For example, 80 ACI points equates
  to 80% ACI performance, resulting in 80% (ACI performance) x 25% (ACI category weight)
  x 100 = 20 CPS points contributed by ACI.\n> 2. **Performance Score**: Up to 80
  points for performance on eight measures per the decile scoring scale described
  above.\n> 3. **Bonus Points**: Up to 1 bonus point for reporting to an additional
  public health registry\n\n### Scoring in the Clinical Practice Improvement Activities
  (CPIA) Category\n\nUnder MIPS, a clinician can earn up to 60 points within the CPIA
  category. \n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n> **Base score**: Based on various
  rules (size, location, APM or medical home participation), physicians can earn either
  the full 60 points or some fraction thereof. \n\nThe CPIA percentage score is calculated
  by dividing the total CPIA points by 60. For example, 30 points would yield a 30/60
  = 50% CPIA performance score, which in turn would deliver 50% x (15% CPIA category
  weighting) x 100 = 7.5 CPS points.\n\n### Scoring in the Resource Use Category\n\nMIPS
  rates clinicians for Resource Use (Medicare costs of attributed patients) based
  on 40+ cost measures to account for differences among specialties. 40+ cost measures
  are to be used. The hope is that this variety of cost measures will be able to account
  for differences among specialties.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n> **CMS collects
  and scores based on historical claims data**: There are no separate reporting requirements
  for clinicians, as the measures are calculated based on claims collected by CMS.\n\nSimilar
  to the Quality category, measures can earn up to 10 points each on a percentile
  benchmark scale, and a resource use percentage score is earned by dividing the total
  points across included measures by the total possible points. The percentage score
  is then multiplied by the Resource Use category weight (10% for the CY2017 performance
  year) to deliver the CPS points contributed. \n\nFor instance, say a clinician earns
  8 and 8 points respectively on two included cost measures. Then the category contributes
  (8+8)/20 x 10% x 100 = 8 CPS points. \n\n### Calculating the overall CPS score\n\nAssuming
  that the numerical examples used for the four categories as described above all
  apply to the same clinician, we can calculate a total CPS from the components as
  follows:\n\n> - Quality = (56 of 80 points) x 50% weight x 100 = 35 CPS points\n>
  - ACI = (50 of 100 points) x 25% weight x 100 = 12.5 CPS points\n> - CPIA = (40
  of 60 points) x 15% weight x 100 = 10 CPS points\n> - Resource Use = (14 of 20 points)
  x 10% weight x 100 = 7 CPS points\n> - Total CPS points = 35 + 12.5 + 10 + 7 = 64.5\n\n###
  Reputation and reporting\n\nCMS publishes provider specific performance measures
  through its [Physician Compare website](https://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/search.html)
  for consumers to browse and commercial or any other third party physician rating
  websites to use. As out-of-pocket costs grow, patients are looking for more transparency
  into clinician quality and the cost-value trade-off. A recent [JAMA study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1829975)
  found that 65% of consumers are aware of online physician rating sites and that
  36% of consumers had used a ratings site at least once. MACRA provisions address
  this consumer demand. MIPS will publish each eligible clinician’s annual Composite
  Performance Score (CPS) and scores for each MIPS performance category about 12 months
  after the end of the relevant performance year. In addition, all statistically significant
  measure values in the Quality, Resource Use and Advancing Care Information (ACI)
  categories for each clinician will be available for free download. Activities reported
  for the Clinical Practice Improvement Activities (CPIA) category will be listed
  for every clinician. Physician Compare will continue to publish cost utilization
  data for all Medicare Part B clinicians.\n\nUnlike direct Medicare reimbursement
  impacts which can change year-to-year based on clinician performance, damage to
  a clinician’s online public reputation may take years to reverse. Conversely, consistently
  high performance scores and ratings can become a strategic advantage over competitors.
  So, while there are advantages to being on the high end of the range, short term
  scoring changes can possibly cause significant business impact on organizations.
  From a risk perspective, it does make sense to report at the cohort / TIN level
  rather than at the individual physician level as a way to aggregate and minimize
  variation. This also puts larger physician groups at an advantage for MIPS."

  :summary: There's confusion around the MACRA, MIPs, and APMs goals. It begs the
    question, Is Meaningful Use dead? Learn the MIPS APM and MACRA acronyms and more.
  :lead: |-
    There is confusion in the industry around MACRA, MIPs, and APMs. It begs the question, Is Meaningful Use dead? The confusion is justified as the topic is both broad and dense, especially since we’ve been operating in a world of acronyms under the “Medicare EHR incentive program”—more commonly called Meaningful Use—for years.

    This article will outline old program terminology and how they’re being replaced with new incentive programs. It will dive into the new program structures and provide links to helpful resources so you can cut through the clutter.
  :post: |+
    ### Get to Know the Acronyms

    Acronyms are no fun, but even worse are when old acronyms are replaced by new acronyms that mean essentially the same thing. It causes unnecessary confusion and wastes brain-power. This is partially what we are experiencing with MACRA and MIPS.

    #### Old Acronyms Being Replaced by New Acronyms

    | Acronym | Term | Description |
    |---------|------|-------------|
    | MU | Meaningful Use | The Medicare EHR incentive program is now a component of MIPS and is called Advancing Care Information. Will we start saying ACI? Probably. |
    | EP | Eligible Professional | What we used to call an eligible professional under Meaningful Use is now called Eligible Clinician (EC) within MIPS. |

    #### Net-New Acronyms

    | Acronym | Term | Description |
    |---------|------|-------------|
    | MACRA | [Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2/text) | Replaced the old way of doing business with a new business model focused on value based care. Or, in CMS language, MACRA, bipartisan legislation, replaces the flawed Sustainable Growth Rate formula by paying clinicians for the value and quality of care they provide.  MACRA created the Quality Payment Program. |
    | QPP | [Quality Payment Program]([Medicare Quality Payment Program](https://qpp.cms.gov/) | The single framework under which MIPS and APMs are administered. The goals of the QPP are described below. |
    | MIPS | Merit-Based Incentive Payment System | Incentive program aligning old models into a single model made up of components. |
    | CPS | MIPS Composite Performance Score | A clinician’s total MIPS score (a singular number) which is comprised of four scores from four weighted categories. |
    | QP | Qualifying APM Participant | Someone that participates in an advanced APM model at a higher threshold. |
    | APM | Advanced Alternative Payment Models | The QPP creates additional incentives for Qualifying Professional’s (QP’s) who participate in an Advanced Alternative Payment Models.  It does not create the APM or alter the structure of APMs. (Some think these should have been called AAPMs.) |

    ### What is the overarching goal?

    The goal of CMS is to increase the focus on quality and value-based care. By the end of this year, CMS plans to tie 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models and to tie 85% of fee-for-service payments to quality. To do that, the Quality Payment Program has been created and has two branches. Clinicians will either participate in MIPS or an APM. Most clinicians will be subject to MIPS. Clinicians will be excluded from MIPS if they meet a low volume threshold, are in their first year of Medicare Part B Participation, or if they participate in the other branch of the quality payment program, an advanced alternative payment model (APM).

    ### What is MIPS?

    MIPS is a single incentive program that streamlines three current programs within it: the physician quality reporting system (PQRS), Value Based Payment, and the Medicare EHR incentive program for eligible professionals (Meaningful Use for EP). It is important to note that the EHR incentive program for hospitals will continue; MIPS does not apply to hospitals. Also, the Medicaid EHR incentive program for eligible professionals will continue. MIPS will take effect in 2018 and MIPS begins adjusting payments in 2019. The fourth component of MIPS is new; Clinical Practice Improvement Activities.

    ![Adjustment potential](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5opGoVRPva4gISKImY82o0/905bdf716ec91c8a6e45ba6389660c29/academy-image00.png?w=760)

    MIPS is comprised of four Performance Categories which make up a composite performance score (CPS) of a possible 100 points. Clinicians can submit their individual score or a score for their entire group. The four performance categories are Quality, Resource Use, Clinical Practice Improvement Activity, Advancing Care Information. CMS will report the physician’s score publicly on Physician Compare.

    In 2017, groups will report year’s worth of data to CMS so a national threshold can be calculated. This is the MIPS performance threshold and it will be used as comparison to a clinician's MIPS composite score (CPS) when determining the appropriate payment adjustment in year 2019. Clinicians with a CPS higher than the national performance threshold will receive an upward adjustment of MPFS payments (up to 4% in 2019, increasing to 9% by 2023), while a physician whose CPS is below that threshold will be subject to a corresponding downward adjustment.

    ![How will Macra affect me?](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5IyfqPwN56G22q0QE0oQIq/116afdad3c083e0bc398dd4526f8e0f1/academy-image01.png?w=760)

    ### What is an APM?

    Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs) are defined by CMS as new approaches to paying for medical care through Medicare that incentivize quality and value. MACRA doesn’t create new Advanced Alternative Payment Models. Just as MACRA created MIPS, a program to change the reimbursement model, that’s the exact goal of MACRA under APMs as well; additional incentives for APM participation.

    Although the majority of clinicians will be subject to MIPS, those that participate in Advanced Payment Models at a certain threshold, such as Accountable Care Organizations, will be excluded from the MIPS program. To be considered as an APM, at least 50% of the participating clinicians must use a certified EHR technology. This threshold increases to 75% after year one. The group must also base payment on quality measures comparable to those in the MIPS program. Finally, APM entities are required to bear more than nominal financial risk. Eligible Clinicians can become Qualifying APM Participants if a certain percent of their patients or payments are through an APM. QP’s are eligible for a 5% lump sum bonus in years 2019 - 2024 and even higher in subsequent years. Only QP’s are excluded from MIPS.

  :summary: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
    back to the states, you must address EU-U.S. Privacy Shield — an additional privacy
    requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice.
  :blog_lead: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
    back to the states, you must address an additional privacy requirement laid out
    by the European Court of Justice. The [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome),
    which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies a stronger obligation
    on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either self-certify for the
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment. This [self-certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1)
    or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy Shield Framework requirements
    that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
  :post: "\nWhile everyone is gearing up for the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) that goes into effect for the European Union on May 25, 2018, one critical
    facet cannot be overlooked for customers who aspire to work internationally.\n\n##
    Q & A with Lori Meals\n\nDatica Director of Compliance Lori Meals has been gathering
    more details on the Privacy Shield and readying Datica for its own self-certification.
    She recently sat down to answer questions on the topic that will be helpful to
    you as you think through the necessary steps in bringing private health data back
    to the states from abroad.\n \n### Why are the privacy protections more stringent
    in the European Union than the U.S.?\n \nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to this sort of personal data being
    shared.\n \n### Why was the Safe Harbour Framework invalidated and the EU-U.S.
    Privacy Shield enacted in its place?\n \nAll comes down to [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).
    Remember him? He’s the former National Security Association (NSA) contractor who
    revealed that the intelligence agency had been spying on European citizen data
    held by American companies.  That snowball quickly rolled downhill to Facebook.
    Austrian student Max Schrems filed subsequent lawsuits, alleging that Facebook
    had not been protecting personal data of Europeans, as extrapolated from the Snowden
    leaks. Those leaks showed that the NSA performed surveillance on technology companies,
    like Facebook. His complaints landed in the European Court of Justice whose governance
    quickly invalidated the Safe Harbour Framework and exacted a seismic shift upon
    international data privacy.\n\n### Is the Privacy Shield certification required
    for Datica?\n \nNo, it is not incumbent upon us, but it is for our customers,
    assuming they are expanding into Europe and/or using European citizen data. Without
    the Privacy Shield, a U.S. company is potentially liable when not adhering to
    these principles.\n \n### What must a customer know about Privacy Shield?\n \nThe
    Privacy Shield has a couple of important vocabulary words: data controller and
    data processor. Datica would be the “data processor” because we only work on behalf
    of those who are collecting the data. The Privacy Shield lays out the data protection
    principles that gives an individual the right to know that a company not only
    holds your data, but that the individual can request that such data be deleted,
    updated or changed, as well as requesting copies of it.\n \n### Is there anything
    else that a Datica customer needs to know?\n \nBefore expanding into Europe, U.S.
    companies must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). The DPA signifies the agreement
    the parties’ have made with respect to terms governing personal data processing.
    Organizations will also need to contract with a 3rd party to handle complaints
    about how the organization handles data, should any arise. \n\n### How does this
    impact digital health companies long-term?\n \nThe rules and regulations have
    become more stringent upon U.S. companies involved with cross border data transfers.
    Abiding by the European requirements is imperative for staying out of hot legal
    waters. \n\nDatica exists to help make digital health companies successful whether
    they work solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial
    waters between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today.
    When everyone follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success
    and decrease the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\n"

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: 'The January, 2018 draft of the Trusted Exchange Framework is the first
    real step toward interoperability since the Cures Act was passed. '
  :blog_lead: 'One of the biggest obstacles to using electronic health data to the
    fullest potential is the lack of interoperability. At every level of healthcare,
    the lack of interoperability causes problems: patients cannot easily access their
    own health data, providers have problems accessing the health information of new
    patients, researchers cannot access the data necessary to identify trends that
    would improve population health, and technology companies struggle to compete
    in a closed marketplace. '
  :post: "The [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text),
    sometimes referred to as the Cures Act, which was passed in December 2016, identifies
    the need for interoperability. Interoperability would make the exchange of personal
    health information (PHI) possible while still maintaining security. Currently,
    information is siloed within EHR systems, and [data integration with those EHRs](https://datica.com/platform/integration/)
    is frequently cited issue for healthcare providers. \n\nAlongside the need for
    various stakeholders to be able to access information, there is the requirement
    to follow the dictates of the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA)](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/). Information needs
    to be accessible, but must also remain secure. Through the Cures Act, Congress
    instructed the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to create or support the
    creation of a framework for health information networks (HINs) to exchange health
    information through a common agreement. \n\n## What is The Trusted Exchange Framework?\n\nThe
    draft Trusted Exchange Framework is the first step toward interoperability. The
    ONC has published a [User’s Guide to Understanding the Draft Trusted Exchange
    Framework](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-guide.pdf). The
    document was released on January 5, 2018, and consists of two parts:\n\nPart A
    - Principles for Trusted Exchange\nPart B - Minimum Required Terms and Conditions
    for Trusted Exchange\n\nStakeholders are [encouraged to submit comments](https://beta.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement)
    through February 20, 2018. Once comments have been submitted and a final version
    agreed upon, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) will
    be published in the Federal Register. The ONC expects the final version to be
    published by late 2018. \n\nThe stakeholders include: \n\n* Health information
    networks\n* Federal agencies\n* Public health organizations\n* Individuals\n*
    Payers\n* Providers\n* Technology developers\n\nOne of the most important goals
    of the Trusted Exchange Framework is to create what the ONC describes as “a single
    on-ramp” to interoperability. Currently, healthcare organizations use different
    point-to-point interfaces to exchange PHI with each other. This system requires
    the creation and maintenance of all those individual interfaces, which is expensive
    and inefficient. \n\nCreating one framework for various stakeholders to exchange
    information will simplify the process, make accessing their own PHI easier for
    patients, and create a more competitive market for technology companies. \n\n##
    Two Parts of the Trusted Exchange Framework\n\n### Trusted Exchange Framework
    Part A\n\nThe first part of the Framework is Principles for Trusted Exchange.
    The ONC has defined six principles: \n1. Standardization\n2. Transparency\n3.
    Cooperation and Non-Discrimination\n4. Security and Patient Safety\n5. Access\n6.
    Data-Driven Accountability \n\nThese general principles are described as “guardrails,”
    and the goal of Part A is to build trust among the various HINs. \n\n### Trusted
    Exchange Framework Part B\n\nThe second part of the framework is Minimum Required
    Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. This section creates common practices
    for the exchange of health information, including a common authentication process,
    rules for exchange, and organizational and operational practices. \n\nSpeaking
    to [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/onc-genevieve-morris-trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-interoperability),
    Genevieve Morris, the principal deputy national coordinator for health information
    technology at the ONC said, \n\n> This is just the floor of what those required
    terms and conditions are. We all just have to agree to the same terms in order
    for that exchange to happen.” \n\n## Building on the 3 Goals of Interoperability\n\nThe
    Trusted Exchange Framework builds on the work that the industry has already done
    to advance interoperability. [A press release](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/01/05/draft-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-released-hhs.html)
    from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the draft stresses
    that there are three important goals of interoperability: \n\n1. Patient access
    - patients should be able to easily access their own health information.\n2. Population-level
    data exchange - both providers and payers need access to population-level health
    data in order to analyze trends, outcomes, and costs.\n3. Open and accessible
    APIs - giving the health IT community access to health information will improve
    the entrepreneurial climate, leading to innovation and improved usability. \n\nThe
    ONC will outsource the actual implementation of the framework. The ONC will hold
    an “open and competitive selection of a single Recognized Exchange Framework Entity
    (RCE) from the industry,” wrote Morris in a [blog post on HealthIT Buzz](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-common-sense-approach-achieving-health-information-interoperability/).
    \ \n\nThe RCE will work with the ONC to develop the final version of the TEFCA
    that is published in the Federal Register. \n"

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout
    drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n### HITRUST
    Essentials\n* [The HITRUST Guide](https://datica.com/guide/hitrust/)\n* [What
    is HITRUST?](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/)\n* [What is the HITRUST
    Framework?](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework)\n* [The Purpose

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
