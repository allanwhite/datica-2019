  :description: General Data Protection Regulation
:summary: Cloud Service Providers doing business in the EU are Processors under GDPR—it's
  kind of like being a HIPAA Covered Entity in the U.S. Read more on GDPR Service
  Providers.
:lead: 'General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) starts and ends with the different
  definitions of "Controller" and "Processor" and the relationship between the two.
  Using HIPAA as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor
  is like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.

'
:post: "If you are reading this, within GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
  sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of health
  IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based modality
  can be considered a \"cloud service provider\" which means a Processor, which means
  this article is for you. Let's understand together the obligations Processors (and
  cloud service providers) have within GDPR.\n\n## GDPR Risk Allocation\n\nMuch like
  [HIPAA, GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/) is meant
  to outline risk allocation between business partners. It's a legal framework for
  risk, nothing more; as a framework GDPR does have more teeth than HIPAA in regards
  to potential financial penalties. The dirty secret about HIPAA is that it's nothing
  more than a set of recommendations, which is why a world of consultants, compliance
  experts, and legal frameworks exists to try to interpret and define the recommendations.
  GDPR is no different.\n\nIn terms of risk allocated to the relationship, Controllers
  assume primary risk, as defined in [Article 24.1](https://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html):\n\n>
  Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well
  as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
  persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
  measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in
  accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where
  necessary.” \n\nProcessors then assume risk when engaging with the Controller, as
  defined in Article 28.1:\n\n> [W]here processing is to be carried out on behalf
  of a controller, the controller shall only use processors providing sufficient guarantees
  to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner
  that processing will meet the requirements of [GDPR] and ensure the protection of
  the rights of the data subjects.”\n\nBut most importantly, Article 28 continues
  to underline the obligations of Processors in section 28.3(f):\n\n> [The Processor
  is required to] assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations
  pursuant to Article 32 – 36 taking into account the nature of the processing and
  the information available to the processor.”\n\nWhen outlining risk, Processors
  have a lot of obligations. One way to interpret GDPR is that risk automatically
  flows down the supply chain, Controller to Processor to Sub-processor and so on.
  You will, by default, gain the obligations to abide by GDPR unless otherwise defined.\n\nThis
  is an important point: It's up to the Processor to tell the Controller where the
  line is drawn in the relationship, and not the other way around.\n\nMany of the
  major potential [GDPR hosting providers](https://hackernoon.com/why-gdpr-compliance-is-difficult-in-the-cloud-9755867a3662)
  are managing it this way already. AWS famously created their \"Shared Responsibility\"
  model, in which they outline AWS will own risk associated to compliance _of_ the
  cloud, like physical data centers, while its customers are responsible for compliance
  _in_ the cloud, like encryption, disaster recovery, and many more responsibilities.\n\nThe
  takeaway: If you are handling PHI in the cloud, within GDPR, you as a processor
  will assume the flow of risk unless you collaborate with your Controller partner
  to outline what risks you will not take on.\n\n## Data protection by design and
  by default\n\nProcessors must demonstrate \"data protection by design and by default\"
  which are terms from GDPR.\n\n**Data protection by design** is explained in Article
  25.1 as \n\n> taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation
  and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of
  varying likelihood and severity for rights of freedoms of natural persons posed
  by the processing shall, both at the time of determination of the processing and
  at the time of processing, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures,
  such as pseudonymisation which are designed to implement the data protection principles
  in an effective manner in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect
  the rights of data subjects.”\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection by design_ means
  that the product or service is built on top of an existing compliance and security
  framework. This is loosely similar to the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/the-hipaa-security-rule/).\n\n**Data
  protection by default** is explained in Article 25.1 as\n\n> The controller shall
  implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by
  default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the
  processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data
  collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their
  accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal
  data are not made accessible without the individual’s intervention to an indefinite
  number of natural persons.\"\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection by default_ means
  that the product or service has operational controls on top of data access. In HIPAA
  terms, this is loosely similar to the Privacy Rule.\n\n## The role of HITRUST in
  GDPR Compliance\n\nThe reason to call out _data protection by design and by default_
  for GDPR cloud hosting providers is to highlight the ultimate plan of action. In
  short, cloud providers need to use existing compliance and security frameworks to
  demonstrate operational control as it relates to both the technical construction
  of the product or service and the business processes surrounding the product or
  service.\n\nThis is very similar to HIPAA, which is where existing frameworks like
  HITRUST, ISO, SOC 2, etc. can come into play. Demonstrating GDPR compliance as a
  cloud service provider is important, but there aren't prescriptive ways to do so
  yet. [HITRUST or ISO certifications](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
  can work as a proxy for GDPR compliance for the time being.\n\n*Learn more about

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program,
    including GDPR, is breach notification.
  :lead: 'One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program
    is breach notification. “Beach notification” is actually multiple tasks — survelliance,
    investigation, and ultimately notification (to end users, partner, and sometimes
    media). It is time consuming, [expensive](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3234685/data-protection/how-much-will-non-compliance-with-gdpr-cost-you.html),
    and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead to more
    investigations. '
  :post: "The 72-hour security breach requirement written into General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating a lot of attention and angst.
    72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things that organizations are used
    to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals about a breach.\n\n##
    HIPAA vs. GDPR Breach Notifications\n\nIn the case of HIPAA in the United States,
    notifying affected individuals of a breach, especially when they number in the
    thousands or even millions, can be a massively resource-intensive endeavor; it
    is also very expensive. That said, in the United States under HIPAA often individuals
    are notified weeks or months after a breach is actually discovered. This is typically
    because healthcare organizations take time to investigate the scope and cause
    of breaches, mitigate the vulnerabilities that caused the breach, and develop
    and implement a process for managing notifications.\n\nThe [HIPAA Breach Notification
    Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification) requires
    that covered entities, or the delegates of covered entities (business associates
    typically), notify individuals and Health and Human Services (HHS) “without unreasonable
    delay and in no case later than 60 days following a breach”. 60 days is a lot
    of time. Breach notification under HIPAA is often a part of a [business associates
    agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (BAA) between covered entities and business associates. In many cases, we see
    breach reporting times of 30 to 60 days for cloud service providers, which aligns
    with the 60-day breach reporting requirement in HIPAA. Datica guarantees 4-hour
    breach reporting in our BAA with partners because our philosophy has always been
    to proactively notify in order to expedite discovery, containment, and notification
    to individuals while minimizing the risk to our partners; delaying notification
    to our partners exposes them to more risk, not less.\n\n## GDPR Articles 33 and
    34\n\nThe GDPR breach notification requirement, contained in [Articles 33 and
    34 of GDPR](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf)
    and [in contrast to HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/),
    states that “the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not
    later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data
    breach to the supervisory authority.” 72 hours is not a lot of time, even only
    to notify authorities and not individuals. For organizations operating in Europe
    with HIPAA-oriented policies, changes are likely required.\n\nThe first step to
    bringing your policies and procedures into compliance with GDPR is to accept that
    [GDPR breach reporting](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/) is more prescriptive
    and more aggressive than with HIPAA, or likely any other compliance frameworks
    to which you are familiar. From this first step it’s a matter of running a stringent
    process to update both your technology and organizational practices. You will
    also want to review the breach reporting obligations that your processors and
    subprocessors have in your data protection agreements. And do all that quickly
    as May 2018, the date GDPR goes into effect, is rapidly approaching.\n\n*Learn

  :summary: 'GDPR compliance is an imperative starting May, 2018 for companies who
    work with data on EU citizens. Understand the fines and penalties in Article 83. '
  :lead: If you work with data on EU citizens, complying with GDPR is an imperative
    starting in May of 2018. Article 58 of GDPR grants supervisory authority the ability
    to not only to investigate controllers and processors but also to impose fines.
    The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article 83. The fines are in
    addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective actions, outlined in
    Article 58.
  :post: "\n## Article 83 GDPR Fines and Penalties\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language,
    and the bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83.
    There are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of
    total worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide
    turnover (revenue). The reasons for each of the different fine levels are outlined
    below.\n\n### Low-Level GDPR Fines of 10,000,000 EUR\n\nFines of 10,000,000 EUR
    or 2% of revenue can be levied on controllers and processors based on the following
    terms. \n\n> Infringements of the following provisions shall, by paragraph 2,
    be subject to administrative fines up to 10,000,000 EUR, or in the case of an
    undertaking, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding
    financial year, whichever is higher: \n    a)    the obligations of the controller
    and the processor under Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39 and 42 and 43;\n    b)    the
    obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43;\n    c)
    \   the obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4).”\n\nTo sum
    up the reasons for the lower-level fines, it is that you didn’t follow the principle
    of [security by design](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)
    and in some way, your security posture resulted in a breach of EU citizen data.\n\n###
    High-Level GDPR Fines of 20,000,000 EUR\nFines of 20,000,000 EUR or 4% of revenue
    can be levied on controllers and processors based on the following terms.\n\n>
    Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph
    2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20,000,000 EUR, or in the case of
    an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding
    financial year, whichever is higher:\n    a)    the basic principles for processing,
    including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;\n    b)
    \   the data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;\n    c)    the transfers
    of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation
    pursuant to Articles 44 to 49;\n    d)    any obligations pursuant to Member State
    law adopted under Chapter IX;\n    e)    non-compliance with an order or a temporary
    or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the
    supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide access in
    violation of Article 58(1).”\n\nTo sum up the reasons for the higher-level fines,
    it is that you didn’t follow the principle of [security by default](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/).
    This means the policies and procedures you put in place for your compliance program,
    roughly the principle of data privacy, resulted in a breach of EU citizen data.\n\nThe
    regulation is clear that the intent of fines, regardless of the amount of the
    fine or the body imposing the penalty (Member State vs. EU GDPR Supervisor), imposed
    on controllers and processors is to be “effective, proportionate, and dissuasive”;
    this specific language is also used in Article 84, referenced below. \n\nArticle
    83 lays out factors that will be considered in assessing the size of the fine.
    The factors, and things you can do to minimize your risk of a more substantial
    fine, are outlined below.\n\n## How to minimize your risk of GDPR fines and penalties\n\n###
    Work with authorities proactively \n\nAt the very least, you should ensure you
    meet the [72-hour data breach notification requirement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    for reporting data breaches to authorities. \nMore broadly, you should cooperate
    and be as transparent as possible with authorities. Security by obscurity does
    not work with GDPR.\n\n### Follow recommendations by authorities \n\nOr have clear
    justification and mitigation for why you didn’t follow it. If a GDPR authority
    recommends a specific plan for your organization or even generally to data controllers
    and processors, you should evaluate implementing it. If you decide not to, clearly
    document the reasons why not.\n\n### Build in security by design and default \n\nYou
    need to have privacy (no authorized access) and security (technical security measures)
    in your DNA. Security should be a core part of how you design, develop, deliver,
    and support your products. There should be proof of this posture documented. This
    goes without saying, but you should also have your actions support your intentions
    of complying with GDPR.\n\n### Limit your data exposure\n\nOne of the significant
    factors in determining the amount of the fine is the extent of the precipitating
    data breach. The scope of the breach applies to both the number of records and
    the depth of the data. To minimize your risk exposure, there are things you can
    do to separate data and exposure, so there isn’t one key to the castle.\n\n##
    Article 84 Member States’ Penalties\n\nAdditionally, in Article 84 Member States
    are granted the power to implement their penalties for infringements of GDPR.
    These penalties, which can vary country to country, need to be communicated to
    the Commission by May 25, 2018. As such, this is an evolving area and the true
    extent of penalties for violating GDPR is not yet known.\n\nPenalties for violating
    GDPR and exposing EU citizen data in an unauthorized way are significant. The
    details are still trickling out and will continue to evolve even after GDPR goes
    into effect in May 2018, but the message is clear — if you do business in the
    EU and house data on EU citizens you are exposed to high financial risk.\n\n*Learn

  :summary: This GDPR data breach notification checklist outlines the steps that should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer to ensure GDPR compliance.
  :lead: The breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive
    —“The controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than
    72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the
    supervisory authority.” We discussed how this is different from [breach reporting
    requirements in HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in another Academy article. This post walks through the steps you should take
    to evaluate your breach reporting policies and procedures to bring them inline
    with GDPR.
  :post: "\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process to meet
    the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times, we’ve
    had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we went
    through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should be orchestrated
    by your data protection officer, the person at your organization who is ultimately
    responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n## Define and get consensus on what
    you mean by “breach”\n\nIt’s imperative to agree to the meaning of the term ahead
    of time, and educate your entire workforce and partners about it. Successfully
    meeting the 72-hour timeline for beach notification under GDPR requires that all
    members of your workforce are trained and activated when it comes to identifying
    a potential breach. Under GDPR, [the term “data breach” is more expansive](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)
    under GDPR  than under HIPAA, so it’s important to understand if you are complying
    with the GDPR definition before you go through the process of updating your breach
    notification processes.\n\n## Document your current process\n\nStart with your
    policies. Specifically, in regards to breach notification, these should outline
    1) the steps and 2) the responsible parties when it comes to breach notification.
    You can look at our [Datica breach policies here](https://policy.datica.com/#12-breach-policy).\nThere
    are several key things you need to identify and document:\n\n### Identify Major
    buckets of work \n\nYou don’t have to get into the details yet, but you should
    understand your broad areas of work. Examples are things like identification,
    investigation, containment, and notification (both internal and external).\n\n###
    Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n\nPerfect is the enemy of the good,
    even when it comes to compliance. To condense a set of processes down to meet
    the 72 GDPR data breach requirement successfully, there’s an incredibly high likelihood
    you will have to sequence things in new ways. Understanding the criticality is
    essential to do this. The criticality is based predominantly on the risk to your
    organization of not doing that process.\n\n### Rank each bucket of work by the
    amount of time it takes to complete\n\nFor each of the identified buckets of work,
    rank them by the amount of time they take to complete, from shortest to longest.
    Assume unlimited resources for these assessments.\n\n### Identify Key personnel\n\nIdentify
    required roles for your current process. As a part of this, pay attention to bottlenecks
    and where additional resources might be able to shorten the overall time required.\n\nIf
    this step of documenting your current process is hard to start or complete, you
    may want to quickly look for external assistance from an advisory firm that specializes
    in healthcare compliance. One of the features of GDPR is security by design and
    by default. Timely breach notification is a symptom that falls out of this underlying
    ethos, so it’s likely you need a broader revamp of your security and compliance
    programs.\n\n## Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n\nThis part is challenging because it has a degree of subjectivity.
    Now that you’ve documented your current breach process, you have to identify things
    that can be delayed until after authorities are notified. The GDPR 72 hour timeline
    isn’t for informing individuals; it’s for notifying authorities. The only way
    you’re going to be able to meet the 72 hours is by trimming part of the process.
    Since informing authorities isn't publicly disclosing a breach, some activities,
    like investigation and media strategy, can be done after authorities are notified
    of a breach. The intent of the 72-hour timeline in GDPR is likely to notify authorities
    so they can be prepared proactively and potentially assist with, notifications
    to affected individuals.\n\n## Develop the new process that can be completed in
    72 hours\n\nNow that you’ve documented the current process and made the hard decision
    about what can be delayed until after you notify authorities of a breach, you
    need to document your new process. You don’t need to list the 72-hour timeline
    for notifying authorities. You can outline this in your data protection agreements
    or contracts with customers.\n\nIn light of the GDPR requirements, our view is
    that it is prudent to have one breach notification policy and process that differentiates
    notifying authorities and notifying individuals. You can educate your workforce
    and ensure you can meet the stringent 72 hours for authorities while then doing
    additional steps before you inform individuals.\n\nBelow is a very high-level
    example breach notification process.\n\n1. Discovery\n2. Initial investigation\n3.
    Notify appropriate authorities\n4. Full investigation\n5. Risk assessment\n6.
    Risk mitigation\n7. Individual and public notification\n\n## Create templates/efficiencies\n\nConsistency
    is crucial to any compliance program. Taking the guesswork and busywork out of
    the breach reporting process by creating templates will help you move quickly,
    ideally meeting the GDPR 72 hour breach reporting requirement, and ensure repeatability.
    Templates can be used for the actual documents shared with authorities or with
    individuals. Depending on the workflow tool you’re using, you can create template
    processes in Jira or Trello or any number of project management systems. \n\n##
    Test your new process (and document it)\n\nTesting your breach reporting process,
    and documenting the results of that testing, is a requirement. There are different
    forms of testing. Initial testing should be tabletop testing. This is a form of
    testing where you, and all of the responsible parties, walk through the different
    processes, inputs, and outputs that are a part of breach reporting. You don’t
    do all the steps, but you walk through them as a group to ensure everything is
    clear.\n\nNext, you should do a full test. It doesn’t have to be a secret within
    the organization. You simply simulate the discovery a breach and follow the necessary
    steps. You can make it more complicated by keeping it a secret but, at this stage,
    there is limited value in that. Go through the process and document everything.
    When you’re done, do a retrospective. Use the feedback to inform edits the breach
    notification process.\n\n## Notify customers and partners of your new breach reporting
    process\n\nOnce you’ve created, tested, and documented the testing of your new
    GDPR-ready breach reporting process, you should inform your customers and partners.
    You want them to know that 1) GDOR is different and 2) you have ensured you comply
    with GDPR.\n\n*Learn more about GDPR—Understand the [requirements of data breach

  :summary: What is the definition of a security incident and data breach under HIPAA
    and GDPR and how do they compare? This article breaks down the key terminology.
  :lead: We get asked all the time for the meaning of a data breach. It often comes
    up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident. It gets even muddier
    when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought into the mix. While
    seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between these terms is essential
    to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers. Ambiguity and opacity
    is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and foundational definitions.
  :post: "\n## What is a security incident?\n\nStarting with a security incident,
    which is less ambiguous, [NIST defines the term in 800-61](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)
    as:\n\n> A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation
    of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.”\n\nHIPAA
    has a very similar definition in section 164.304:\n \n> \"A security incident
    as the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification,
    or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information
    system.”\n\nGDPR doesn’t explicitly define “security incident” so a safe path
    is to use the NIST definition if you want to comply with GDPR. GDPR does expand
    the definition of a “personal data breach,” as you’ll see below, so the distinction
    between security incident and data breach is less evident under GDPR than under
    HIPAA.\n\n## What is a HIPAA Data Breach?\n\nThe significant difference between
    a security incident and a data breach, or personal data breach, is the impact
    on individual data.\n\nHHS and HIPAA define a breach simply as:\n\n> A breach
    is, generally, an impermissible use or disclosure under the Privacy Rule that
    compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information.”\n \nAt
    Datica, we’ve used the [HIPAA definition for a data breach](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    But GDPR expands on that definition to include not just “impermissible use and
    disclosure” but “destruction, loss, and alteration” of personal data. As we extend
    our compliance program to meet the requirements of GDPR, we are adjusting our
    definition of breach to the more stringent GDPR definition.\n \n## What is a GDPR
    Data Breach?\n\nGDPR, in the definitions section of the regulation (Article 4),
    defines a “personal data breach” in the following way:\n \n> Personal data breach
    means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction,
    loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
    stored or otherwise processed.”\n\n## What's the difference?\n\nThe other difference
    in data breach between [HIPAA and GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    is the actual type of data. HIPAA is only concerned with “protected health information”
    where GDPR is concerned with “personal data,” a much broader scope. One security
    strategy employed in the US to mitigate the risk of a data breach is to separate,
    logically in storage, personally identifiable data and health data. This separation
    reduces the likelihood of protected health information being breached. Under GDPR,
    this strategy, while good to employ from a security and exposure perspective,
    does not mitigate the risk of personal data breach.\n\nThe differences in terminology
    between these definitions can be subtle. But the impact is significant if you
    don’t explicitly articulate these terms to your workforce because they are an
    essential component of an effective monitoring program and to meeting the [GDPR
    data breach notification requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements)
    outlined in GDPR Article 33 and 34.\n\n*Learn more about GDPR — Understand the

  :lead: "## What is the GDPR?\nGDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation,
    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
    applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the
    academy article, [GDPR for Cloud Service Providers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)\n\n##
    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
