:summary: In starting a compliance program, there is work to be done before you get
  to level one of the maturity model. We call this level zero.
:lead: Using [the maturity model](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
  to [build](https://datica.com/academy/steps-to-climbing-maturity-model/) your compliance
  program is a great strategy. It will walk you through the necessary steps to ensure
  you build the foundation before trying to stand up the walls or put on the roof.
:post: "\nThe challenge, especially if you’re just getting started with developing
  a compliance program, is that there is work that needs to be done [before you get
  to level one](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
  of the maturity model. We call this pre-maturity model work level zero.\n\n## What
  is your compliance DNA?\n\nChoosing your compliance DNA might be easy. It could
  be as simple as saying we work in this one industry, say finance or healthcare or
  education, and we only plan to operate in the United States, Europe, or Canada.
  Increasingly, though, the connected world, powered by the cloud and mobile, is breaking
  down barriers between geographies. It’s also common to operate a business across
  multiple industries.\n\nIf this is the case with your business, there is a good
  chance you will have to comply with multiple compliance regimes. It’s important
  to build your compliance DNA on a framework built to crosswalk to relevant regimes
  to avoid doing a lot of redundant work and data entry for your audits and customer
  security reviews. [Recent data from CHIME](https://chimecentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Healthcares-Most-Wired%E2%80%94National-Trends-2018-FINAL.pdf)
  shows that NIST is the compliance framework of choice for enterprises, with HITRUST
  showing up as an emerging favorite. \n\n![Screen Shot 2018-11-07 at 4.04.13 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2r9YfloevWae8GEWyiei6E/92c53e359e8a07bab6a13f632c0ace9e/Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_4.04.13_PM.png)\n\n##
  Our path to a compliance DNA at Datica\n\nOur focus at Datica has always been in
  healthcare. As a business, we chose an industry vertical and decided to go deep
  in that vertical, removing blockers in getting healthcare data onto the cloud. What’s
  interesting is that we have expanded beyond healthcare compliance regimes as some
  of our healthcare customers have brought us with them to new geographic areas where
  compliance with things like GDPR is now required.\n\nLooking back to 2013, when
  [Datica (formerly Catalyze)](https://datica.com/press-release/catalyze-rebrands-as-datica-solidifies-its-unique-mark-on-healthcare/)
  was founded, the world of privacy and compliance was very different. [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/)
  was starting to pick up steam but was still very early and not yet required by any
  covered entities. [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/) was not yet a thing,
  either in definition or implementation. The [HIPAA Omnibus rule](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
  which created the category of entities called subcontractors, was written but not
  yet implemented. And the concerns around privacy of personal data, highlighted in
  all of the recent news and debate about social media and, in particular, Facebook
  were not on the radar of politicians or the general public; Apple did not promote
  privacy as a differentiator at that time.\n\nCompliance was a company-wide and product
  focus for us from day one. Being in healthcare, we initially chose HIPAA as our
  anchoring compliance framework. We did this because we focused on 1) healthcare
  and 2) the US market. Our first audit was a HIPAA audit.\n\nEven at the time our
  company was founded, we knew we wanted to go beyond HIPAA so we planned to do a
  HITRUST assessment and seek a HITRUST Certification. We completed that assessment
  within the first year of the company and have been actively involved with HITRUST
  ever since. HITRUST has been very good for us and has clear ROI, both [internally](https://datica.com/blog/the-internal-roi-of-hitrust/)
  as well as [externally](https://datica.com/blog/the-truth-about-hitrust-and-why-it-should-become-the-industry-standard/).\n\n>
  HITRUST is our compliance DNA at Datica. Having that DNA has enabled us to develop
  a cadence for our audits and a clear guiding set of requirements at all times for
  all of our employees. \n\nBecause of the nature of HITRUST, and it’s pre-built crosswalks
  to multiple compliance regimes such as [SOC](https://datica.com/academy/soc-2-type-ii-compliance-for-cloud-computing/)
  or GDPR and frameworks  such as NIST or PCI, we have been able to leverage our HITRUST
  work, both entries into the HITRUST CSF and our assessor, to complete audits for
  GDPR and complete our SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2.\n\n## Doing it again\n\nThe truth
  is we did not develop our compliance program at Datica with the maturity model as
  our stepwise approach. In 2013, we developed our compliance program for healthcare
  and for HITRUST. We have since matured in our thinking about compliance and, despite
  being successful with HITRUST and with our compliance program over the last 5+ years,
  we would be more intentional if we were doing it again from scratch.\n\nIf we were
  starting over, one clear intention would be to build our program explicitly along
  the levels outlined in the maturity model. And we would start with level zero —
  an evaluation of the types of customers and, by extension, data and geographies,
  in which we plan to operate. From there, we would know the compliance regimes to
  which we would need to comply and choose an anchoring regime, or a compliance DNA,
  that we would ultimately have to crosswalk to all the relevant regimes.\n\n## Take
  the first step\n\nThe nice thing about a level zero approach is you can get started
  yourself, without any outside help and with minimal web searching skills. You should
  have an understanding of your target customers/users and the types of data you and
  your products will access. From there, you should be able to get a sense of the
  compliance regulations to which you will need to comply, and it’s a short step from
  that point to developing a short list of compliance frameworks that could work as
  your compliance DNA. If you want to learn more about compliance frameworks, regulations,
  controls, rules, and regimes, [start here](https://datica.com/blog/we-wrote-a-book-complete-cloud-compliance/).\n\nAt
  some point, you will need to find more experienced resources to help put policies
  and procedures into place and to start to work your way up the levels of the maturity
  mode; but that is not a day zero problem to solve.\n"

  :summary: 'Getting started with compliance on the cloud is easiest if you have a
    stepwise approach like the 5-level maturity model outlined in this post. '
  :lead: At Datica, we get asked frequently how to start down the path of setting
    up a compliance program for the cloud or adjusting a non-cloud compliance program
    to the cloud. Based on our experience, we wrote a [book](https://www.completecloudcompliance.com/)
    with ways to get started on the cloud all the way to best practices for cloud
    compliance programs.
  :post: |2

    Getting started with compliance on the cloud is easiest if you have a stepwise approach. Conveniently, there is a model made for this. It’s called the [maturity model](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/). The maturity model can be followed along a five-level framework, outlined later in this post. The goal is to start with the basics and work your way to a more mature compliance program and state. Of note, the later levels of the maturity model are hard to achieve in their totality. The maturity model is a framework to continually improve and optimize your compliance program.

    ## Maturity Model Stages

    Below are the 5 levels of the maturity model.

    1. __Policy__. Informed by privacy, these are the overarching, highest level policies for the handling of data and technology.
    2. __Procedure__. These translate the policies from level one above into actionable steps that can be followed.
    3. __Implementation__. These are the specific technical manifestations, or technical configurations, for the procedures above.
    4. __Measurement__. Once implemented, the configurations need to be measured on a continual basis to ensure continued alignment with procedures.
    5. __Management__. As gaps or anomalies are identified through measurement, procedures and resources need to be available to address them.

        shall be applied for users and equipment."</code></p>
        <p>Each piece of technology needs to go through a similar process.</p>
        <p>This is an example <strong>Capability Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand the maturity of controls.</p>

    ## Design Phase - Levels 1 through 3

    The design phase technically includes the first three levels of the maturity model. Starting with building out a set of overarching policies. These policies need to be specific to an organization but there are general structures and even [free templates](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/) available to help you get started.

    Considering the changing nature of technology and cloud technology, in particular, policies still need to be generic enough to be consistent despite the changes. These policies flow to slightly more dynamic procedures that outline the ways that people and tools follow policies. Procedures are then implemented into specific configurations. Below is an example to make this more concrete.

    Let’s assume, as an organization and to meet the compliance requirements for the data and/or geographies relevant to you, you need to monitor access to your data (this is something you should do regardless of compliance requirements). You create a policy that states that you log all access to data and provide automated tooling for detecting anomalies or high-risk events. You then create 1-n procedures for how you collect, store, and review those logs and events. Then, you implement your technology (servers, applications, network devices, cloud services, etc) to gather the relevant data and move it to the appropriate storage location as defined by your procedures. In addition to automated tooling, you will likely also have some manual process of reviewing logs.

    If that’s all done, you’ve successfully climbed the maturity ladder through level three. You need to do this for each control and requirement so it is not a trivial amount of work. That said, this structure can be used over and over again.

    ## Operationalize - Levels 4 and 5

    Operationalizing your compliance program, from a maturity model point of view, encompasses measurement and management. It is rare for organizations to achieve 100% success, or scoring in the context of HITRUST, for levels four or five. Depending on the risk profile and scale of your organization, you can be HITRUST Certified without passing, or at least passing completely and for all controls, on levels four and five.

    Once you implement your technology inline with your procedures which, in turn, tie up to your policies, you need ways to measure your controls to detect anomalies for investigation. There should be an expected state — your implementations — that you measure against. You then need resources, both human and capital, and procedures to manage any detected anomalies.

    While you can be HITRUST Certified without passing completely on levels four and five, these levels are becoming increasingly important. The reason for their importance is the nature of the cloud. The cloud opens up configurations to non-admin and non-ops users, such as software developers. The cloud also changes the available tooling and configurations for [abstracted services](https://datica.com/blog/compliance-is-a-team-sport/) on a constantly dynamic basis. Measuring and managing your compliance program on the cloud is imperative to identify implementation anomalies and reduce your risk.

    Extending the example from above on monitoring access to data, let’s start with the assumption that the technical tools and processes have been put in place to create, store, and analyze an event/log pipeline. The next step, level four (measurement), means you should be tracking to ensure the tools and data are flowing as expected and any manual processes, like reviews of logs, are being done. There is some automation in this process to detect data flow; this automation should be tested on a regular basis to ensure it is working. In the case of Datica, we also use a manual process to monitor manual event review activity; this involves reviewing activity in [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

    Extending into level five (management), there should be resources dedicated to addressing anomalies and gaps identified by measurement. This includes both staff and budget (dollars) set aside for compliance-related work.

    ## Don’t do it all at once

    The example above about monitoring access to data is trivial but speaks to what needs to be done over and over again for each control. The most important thing, because this can become daunting fast, is to just get started. And the maturity model gives a clear stepwise approach on where and how you can get started. Start at level zero by determining the compliance regimes to which you need to comply. Then develop policies (level one), either using an [open source template](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/), from scratch or engage with a third-party consultant to help in the process. Then move to level two and on from there.

    Don’t worry about the higher levels until you’ve ironed out each level beneath them. Developing a compliance program is a journey and you need to take the first step to get to your end goal. The unique thing about the compliance journey *on the cloud* is that the path continually changes despite the destination being a static target.

  :summary: With all the attention on compliance and the need for compliance artifacts,
    or evidence, to be successful, it’s helpful to understand more about artifacts.
  :lead: "Artifact has been used both as a historical/cultural reference and technology
    term. But it seems to be gaining traction in the world of cloud as a term du jour.
    [Azure uses it to describe software packages](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/)
    that can be shared and ensure consistency for teams. [Google uses the term similarly
    for builds](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/build-test-deploy-artifacts).
    And AWS recently launched [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/), a
    portal for customers to gain access to AWS compliance reports. \n"
  :post: "\nThe AWS use for the term artifact for its new portal is the most relevant
    for this guide. In this guide, we walk through the importance of compliance artifacts
    for an effective compliance program. Compliance artifacts are often synonymous
    with compliance evidence. Using this definition, this is a simple topic. But compliance
    artifacts in the context of the cloud are anything but simple. In today's world
    of cloud services, managed services, and APIs, the breadth of artifacts is massive.
    This article also touches on data artifacts that are being shed, often unknowingly,
    by cloud services and can contain protected data that needs to be handled as all
    other protected information is handled.\n\n## Introduction to Evidence\n\nWhen
    it comes to compliance, a [compliance maturity model](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    is a good place to start to appreciate the value of evidence. While privacy defines
    the high-level policies for the management of data and technology, and security
    is the implementation of those privacy-driven policies, compliance is the effective
    measurement of the entire compliance program, from policies through secure implementation.
    Measurement is all about documentation, ideally on an ongoing basis, in support
    of a functioning compliance program and the following of compliance policies.\n\nHopefully,
    compliance is not seen as a checkbox within your organization. When compliance
    is seen as a roadblock or something that is bolted on after the fact, evidence
    is generated and stored for an auditor. It is not seen as having value and it
    is not used internally to monitor and improve compliance posture. Evidence should
    be used to [constantly internally monitor](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    your compliance posture and ensure proactive identification of gaps, threats,
    and risks that can then be mitigated. A mature compliance program does not simply
    implement secure technology configurations and internal processes, it actively
    manages those configurations and implementations to proactively identify and resolve
    gaps, find areas for improvement, and, something we’ve seen at Datica, identify
    where there might be human resource gaps.\n\nCompared to the post-cloud world
    of today, technology choices and workflows were previously limited. Similarly,
    in a pre-cloud world, compliance evidence was more confined. Today, the cloud
    opens up a new world of compliance evidence in the form of both manually generated
    artifacts (most cloud providers can generate certain data and reports on demand)
    and automatically generated artifacts (APIs, logs, event streams, etc). The compliance-relevant
    artifacts generated by cloud services are not well understood or appreciated,
    either by the users of the cloud or by auditors and assessors.\n\n## Examples
    of Compliance Artifacts\n\nWith all the attention on compliance and the need for
    compliance artifacts, or evidence, to be successful, it’s helpful to see common
    examples. The list below is an example list from Datica. It is certainly not exhaustive
    and there are different tools to accomplish the same things.\n\n- __Jira Tickets__.
    We are heavy [Atlassian users](https://www.atlassian.com/) at Datica. In addition
    to general company documentation, we use Confluence for documenting and change
    control for our procedures. When it comes to artifacts, we leverage Jira tickets
    and projects to ensure we document how we follow procedures and provide a historical
    record, with all interactions of users, for all compliance related tasks. We use
    templating in Jira to minimize variability in compliance procedure workflows.
    Jira provides good integrity to ensure logging of activities on tickets.\n  -
    __Event Reviews__. We have certain regular review activities we do per our policies.
    These are scheduled at some cadence from weekly to monthly up to annually. The
    most common examples are things like reviewing logs, vulnerability scan, virus
    scans, system inventory, etc. \n  - __Deployment Tickets__. We do security reviews
    as a part of our deployment ticket process. This aligns our operations with our
    configuration management policies and provides a separation of duties between
    security (reviewers) and operations.\n- __Workstation Configurations__. We standardize
    on MacOS machines at Datica and use [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) to manage those
    machines remotely and ensure hardened configurations are in use. Jamf reports
    are reviewed and logged in Jira but the actual report is also an artifact.\n-
    __Support Tickets__. Some of the events that are triggered by our scans are relevant
    to our customers and, in those cases, we sometimes use Zendesk to communicate
    with them. This means we’ve had to use Zendesk tickets at times for compliance
    artifacts.\n- __Cloud Configurations__. One of the new risk vectors with the cloud
    is configuring managed services from cloud service providers to comply with our
    compliance policies. This is very much an emerging area, one we go deep into in
    our [new book on cloud compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). The challenge
    is not simply setting parameters correctly for cloud services (things like encryption
    and open ports and backups) but also ensuring those configurations don’t change.
    The configuration themselves would ideally be snapshotted to create a historical
    record of evidence. Some of this can be done today with APIs but much of it is
    still manual and bespoke for each cloud service and each cloud provider.\n- __Events__.
    We document our event reviews in Jira, as stated above, but the content of the
    events themselves are also artifacts. For logging, we leverage the [ELK stack](https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/)
    for immediate, shorter-term log storage and access. By policy, we move log data
    to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and retain that data for at least a year.\n-
    __System Inventory__. Doing a system inventory is a lot more difficult on the
    cloud, especially if you have a fleet of hundreds or thousands of instances and
    leverage managed services (like S3 above). In the good old days of data centers
    and purchased hardware, tracking sheets with serial numbers were the norm. Today,
    with virtualization, managed cloud services, and the on-demand nature of the cloud,
    system inventories are harder and harder grok, especially if you need accurate
    historical records. At Datica, we focus on retaining our monthly inventory, based
    on a mix of sources including cloud billing information.\n- __Network Diagrams__.
    This can also be more challenging on the cloud given the nature of virtualization
    and abstraction. We manage a lot of different cloud accounts and environments
    at Datica and typically try to enforce a standard network architecture across
    all of them. This network architecture is what we maintain and it is validated
    by our system inventory.\n- __People Operations__. Compliance is not just about
    technology. Some of the content that would historically be a part of an employee
    file also contains relevant compliance artifacts.\n  - __Employment Agreements__.
    Not all employment agreements are relevant for our compliance program and our
    HITRUST Certification, but some, like our IP agreements, are relevant and we have
    to provide them during our audits.\n  - __Background Checks on Personnel__. We
    conduct background checks on all new employees. We persist these reports as artifacts
    for future reference.\n  - __Security Training__. HIPAA, and most other compliance
    regimes, require regular security training. In reality, given the nature and value
    of digital data today and the role all companies play as stewards of that data,
    security training should be done at every organization, ideally tailored to the
    specific organization. At Datica, we require annual training and we document using
    G Suite (from Google). We also provide [open source HIPAA training](https://training.datica.com)
    if you’re looking for starter content for your own organization.\n- __Patch Testing__.
    Despite the adoption of the cloud and abstracted services from cloud providers
    (some levels of abstraction include the OS and software packages so patching falls
    on cloud providers), unpatched software is and remains one of the most relevant
    threat vectors. Patchers should be tested before going out to production systems
    and this patch testing should be documented, along with the ultimate patch information
    metadata when the patch is actually installed into production. Jira is a good
    tool for this as well.\n- __SLAs__. We have SLAs with the various cloud service
    providers (CSPs). As a part of our [HITRUST Certification](https://datica.com/compliance),
    we are required to assess the performance of CSPs against their stated and committed
    service levels. We do this on an annual basis and we document it using Jira tickets.\n-
    __Risk Assessments__. Risk assessment, and risk generally, should be the driving
    force behind many compliance and security decisions. Full risk assessments should
    be done at least annually while mini-risk assessments, those that evaluate significant,
    and sometimes even small, changes to your technology and compliance program should
    be done on an ad hoc basis as needed. At Datica, we leverage a risk assessment
    template in a Google Sheet that is based on NIST standards for risk assessments.\n\n##
    How to Use Artifacts\n\nArtifacts should be used to 1) internally monitor and
    measure the performance of your compliance program and 2) externally validate
    your compliance program for auditors and other third parties. In both uses, organization
    and regular pruning of your compliance artifacts are essential (pruning doesn’t
    mean deleting).\n\nThe major challenge we’ve experienced at Datica is compliance
    artifact overload and consistent organization, especially with personnel changes
    (growth and departures). Your compliance program, and the associated evidence,
    should not be tied to any one individual and should outlast your team. This is
    easier said than done.\n\nAs you can see above, there are a lot of different forms
    of artifacts from the documentation of reviews (we use Jira for this) to logs
    to scans to SLAs to personnel files and more. We’ve tried multiple times to consolidate
    our tooling but, in the end, we still have a mix of Jira, Zendesk, AWS S3, ELK
    (on CSP), and G Suite. This highlights the volume and variety of compliance artifacts
    for a modern cloud company and the associated challenge of organizing those artifacts.
    We still use regular manual grooming to ensure things are in the right places.\n\nSince
    we’ve been unable to consolidate all of our artifacts into one tool, the key is
    to document, ideally within the procedures themselves, where each type of compliance
    artifact is stored and to ideally ensure there is a separation between those that
    create/store the artifacts and those that access/organize/prune the artifacts.\n\n##
    A Caveat of Securing Artifacts (and risks)\n\nBackups, APIs, logs, scans, tickets
    and more can and do create a lot of data exhaust. This data exhaust can be in
    the content itself or in the metadata associated with the artifacts. This data
    exhaust can contain PHI (logs are the easiest example to imagine this being the
    case) and, as such, needs to be secured and treated like any of PHI to which you
    are responsible. That means BAAs should be in place with any relevant tools/tech
    that are storing compliance artifacts and other protections, per your organizations’
    policies, should be implemented.\n\n## Starting is the Hardest Part\n\nEffectively
    capturing and managing compliance artifacts is not fun. And it’s not easy today
    as most organizations use a mix of service providers for various aspects of their
    technology. But it’s necessary to effectively move up the [compliance maturity
    model](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
    \ and being a trusted party in today’s world where trust is an essential asset.\n"

  :summary: In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure, and
    ways to leverage a maturity model, such as the HITRUST maturity model, to optimize
    your compliance posture.
  :lead: Many people view compliance as a checkbox or something you just have to do
    in order to operate within a certain geographic or vertical market. While privacy,
    compliance, and security are not the same things, none of them are simple bolt-ons
    or checkboxes. Another common misconception is that doing security right means
    you are compliant. This is simply untrue and represents a historic view of compliance
    as a liability instead of as an asset to be used for competitive advantage.
  :post: "\nCompliance is not binary but when you think about it as a checkbox or
    afterthought you end up framing it in that way. The nuance of compliance is represented
    well in the maturity model now commonly used in practice for evaluating compliance
    programs and requirements. Maturity models take different forms. At Datica, we
    leverage HITRUST for our compliance program so use the HITRUST-specific flavor
    of maturity model, which in turn is based on the [NIST Program Review for Information
    Security Management Assistance (PRISMA)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir7358.pdf)
    methodology. In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure,
    and ways to leverage a maturity model to optimize your compliance posture.\n\n##
    The Purpose of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA framework was created by NIST
    to support the vast array of information technology and information security requirements
    of federal agencies. In this mandate, it has flexibility and extensibility built
    into the maturity model. This flexible structure is highly aligned with the needs
    of a compliance maturity model for the cloud as the cloud has a huge array of
    different technology implementations and use cases. Additionally, as we will see
    with the actual scoring of maturity models, the thresholds can be set differently
    based on the risk to specific organizations and information system environments.\n\n##
    Structure of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA model, and similarly the HITRUST
    maturity model, have five distinct maturity levels. For the purposes of this guide,
    we will focus on the [HITRUST maturity model](https://hitrustalliance.net/documents/csf_rmf_related/RiskAnalysisGuide.pdf)
    from this point on, which again is a modified version of the PRISMA with the first
    three maturity levels being the same. HITRUST, in its own words, buckets levels
    one through three as “design effectiveness” and levels four and five our as “operational
    effectiveness”.\n\nThe HITRUST maturity levels are outlined below with summary
    points.\n\n1. __Policy.__ These are the high-level policy and standard documents
    that outline the goals and define the overarching compliance program within an
    organization. HITRUST clearly states that these include “shall” and “will” statements,
    clearly articulating, in writing, the formal goals of an organization. The starting
    point for policies is often a mix of internal data privacy needs and external
    compliance regimes to which the organizations must attest and ultimately comply.
    \ These should be made easily accessible to all employees and contractors.\n2.
    __Procedures.__ Procedures define the ways in which policies are to be carried
    out or implemented as well as the specific teams and individuals that are responsible
    for them. In the simplest form, procedures outline how an organization follows
    its own policies. This can be an extremely detailed and difficult step but is
    essential to tying policies, above, to implementation, below, in a consistent
    and defensible way.\n3. __Implementation.__ This is the actual implementation
    of the controls (settings, configurations, etc) that are defined by procedures
    and mandated by policies. Once implemented, and ideally required by procedures,
    these implementations should have some initial testing performed to ensure baselines
    have been achieved.\n4. __Measurement.__ Ongoing, not one and done, testing of
    all three of the above maturity levels is required to successfully achieve this
    level. These are self-assessments performed internally within an organization.
    Baseline metrics or KPIs for policies, procedures, and implementations should
    be defined and tracked over time. Threats are dynamic, more now than ever with
    the pace of technology and the cloud, so those need to be continually assessed
    as well. In some respects, this maturity level is an ongoing risk assessment or
    a set of mini risk assessments.\n5. __Management.__ From our experience, “Managed”,
    as a maturity level, is the least well understood; it’s also rarely achieved or
    fully achieved, by organizations going through a HITRUST assessment. Managed is
    tied to Measured above in that it is assessing how an organization responds to
    the outcomes, or measures, of control testing. An example is when testing detects
    anomalies. In those cases, do organizations have processes and procedures that
    are followed to assess the root cause of the anomalies and then address or make
    changes as to ensure alignment with policies and procedures. One key activity
    in this level is setting metric goals and then assessing and responding to those
    over time.\n\n## Privacy, Security, and Compliance\n\nThere is a tight interplay
    between privacy, security, and compliance. Oftentimes there is confusion on the
    boundaries of each. Leveraging the maturity model is an easy way to differentiate,
    albeit with some gray area remaining, between these increasingly important functions.
    At Datica, we take this approach and leverage it to break down the maturity model
    to assess our privacy, compliance, and security independently.\n\nWe view Privacy
    as largely residing at the Policy level, with some input from Compliance in terms
    of external frameworks and requirements (like GDPR in Europe). Procedures are
    coupled tightly with Implementation and both align with the functions of Security.
    The last two levels, Measurement and Management, fit with the functions of Compliance
    to continually assess, certify, and document necessary compliance artifacts and
    corrective action plans.\n\n\n<div class=\"row bg-white collapse pad group align-middle

    is a Control?</h4>\n    <p>Example: <code>\"Users shall only be provided with
    access to\n    internal and external network services that\n    they have been
    specifically authorized to use.\n    Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n
    \   shall be applied for users and equipment.\"</code></p>\n    <p>Each piece
    of technology needs to go through a similar process.</p>\n    <p>This is an example
    <strong>Capability Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand
    the maturity of controls.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## How HITRUST Scores the Model\n\nScoring
    of the maturity model is complex and beyond the scope of this article. At a high
    level, each control, of which there can be hundreds, is assessed against the maturity
    model. The maturity model is not applied to an organization as a whole, but to
    each specific HITRUST control. For each control, each maturity level is rated
    as: \n\n* Non-Compliant (0%),\n* Somewhat Compliant (25%),\n* Partially Compliant
    (50%),\n* Mostly Compliant (75%), or \n* Fully Compliant (100%). \n\nThe percentage
    is supposed to coincide with a rough numerical equivalent. When completing a HITRUST
    assessment, there is a rating for each maturity level for each control. If you
    have 50 relevant HITRUST controls, you have 250 maturity ratings (50 x 5). These
    ratings are verified by 3rd party assessors and ultimately certified by HITRUST.
    These ratings are then used to calculate an overall rating, which determines if
    you pass or fail the assessment.\n\n## How to use the Maturity Model\n\nThe maturity
    model is an excellent framework to build, maintain, and optimize a full stack
    compliance program; in HITRUST terms, it can be used to both “design” and “operationalize”
    your compliance program. _Full stack_ in this context means _full stack maturity_,
    or successfully demonstrating compliance across all levels of the maturity model.
    In practical terms, even using the maturity model as a guide, there is not a time
    when you are “fully compliant” and can sit back and relax. Compliance needs to
    be ongoing and proactive, and the maturity model is a framework that can be leveraged
    to do that over time and to meet the myriad of new technologies, partnerships,
    data, and compliance tools.\n\nAt Datica, we leverage the [HITRUST maturity model](https://datica.com/compliance/).
    We used it to ensure consistency from policies, or privacy, through implementation,
    or security, to management, or compliance. We even classify the technology tools
    we use into the levels of the maturity model they help to address. An example
    of this would is the logging mechanism we use fits into implementation, the events
    we log into procedures and policies, and the documentation of log review into
    measurement and management. We have had successful outcomes, and eased our external
    audit burden, by aligning and mapping our privacy, security, and compliance posture
    to a maturity model.\n\n\n\n\n"

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
