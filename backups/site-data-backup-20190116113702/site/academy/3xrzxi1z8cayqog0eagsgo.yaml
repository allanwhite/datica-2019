  > The reason a lot of people do not recognize opportunity is because it usually goes around wearing overalls looking like hard work. – Thomas A. Edisons

  The term “HIPAA compliant” gets thrown around a lot—by vendors, consultants, developers, audits, and others. The problem with the free flowing nature of the term is that “HIPAA compliant” is subjective. The only way to [prove](https://catalyze.io/learn/proving-hipaa-compliance) compliance is to complete—and pass—an external audit, preferably one conducted by a reputable audit firm with HIPAA experience.
:post: |-
  Because of the subjective nature of HIPAA and variability in audits (as a former info sec auditor I feel qualified in saying that), [covered entities](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-hipaa-privacy-rule) have a hard time assessing compliance and security for external vendors as well as internal projects (think innovation groups and research). Oftentimes the result is a re-invention of the wheel every time a vendor sells to a new covered entity and every time a covered entity assesses the security of a new vendor. It’s incredibly inefficient and ripe with opportunities to miss things; missing things with security and compliance expose covered entities to significant risk. Enter HITRUST, an industry-driven effort to standardize on a common, certifiable framework to benefit both vendors and covered entities.

  ### Introduction to HITRUST

  [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/), or the Health Information Trust Alliance, is actually not a framework at all, but the organization that created and maintains the Common Security Framework, or [CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/). The CSF, currently in version 7, is a certifiable framework that brings together, or harmonizes, several other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, PCI, ISO, and NIST. By “harmonize” the CSF maps all of those standards together, with the CSF as the central mapping key.

  According to its website, HITRUST, and its corresponding CSF, “was born out of the belief that information security should be a core pillar of, rather than an obstacle to, the broad adoption of health information systems and exchanges.” Security and compliance are a key part of the success of health technology; they cannot be ignored or treated as an afterthought. Without a standardized framework, process, and certifying body, HIPAA is often an obstacle for healthcare technology. HITRUST is an attempt to help vendors better prove their security and to help covered entities streamline security and compliance reviews of vendors. In that attempt, HITRUST is succeeding. More and more health systems are asking for HITRUST and vendors that have it are moving more quickly through the process with covered entities.

  (Image credit: [HITRUST CSF Assurance Program](https://hitrustalliance.net/content/uploads/2014/04/BA-1-Understand-the-CSF-and-CSF-Assurance-Program.pdf))


  ### CSF Domains and Controls

  The CSF is divided into 19 different domains. In contrast to HIPAA, the CSF does not create broad buckets like Administrative and Security controls.

  * Information Protection Program
  * Endpoint Protection
  * Portable Media Security
  * Mobile Device Security
  * Wireless Protection
  * Configuration Management
  * Vulnerability Management
  * Network Protection
  * Transmission Protection
  * Password Management
  * Access Control
  * Audit Logging & Monitoring
  * Education, Training & Awareness
  * Third Party Security
  * Incident Management
  * Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
  * Risk Management
  * Physical & Environmental Security
  * Data Protection & Privacy

  In addition to the above domains, HITRUST has 135 specific controls.


  ### CSF Levels of Implementation

  For each of the 135 controls defined by HITRUST, there are 3 distinct implementation levels. Each implementation level builds on the one below - level 2 includes all of level 1 plus additional requirements, level 3 includes all of level 2 plus additional requirements. So technically level 3 is the most stringent set of requirements. Most organizations have varied levels of implementation for different controls and are not just level 1 or 2 or 3 across the board.

  I think this is the area in which there is the most confusion about HITRUST, or at least the area in which we get asked most about our own HITRUST CSF Certification. The start of every HITRUST assessment, regardless of the type of assessment (see Degrees of Assurance below for more on that), is gathering information about the entity being assessed. This information is used to assess the organization, system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment. Conceptually, the risk or scope of the assessment is being determined.

  This step is also written into HIPAA but is not a part of most assessments. HIPAA allows for controls that are reasonable and appropriate. In the words of HHS `An important step in protecting electronic protected health information (EPHI) is to implement reasonable and appropriate administrative safeguards that establish the foundation for a covered entity’s security program.` Most HIPAA assessments are one size fits all because there is no framework to interpret `reasonable` and `appropriate`; in the end, it’s likely a good thing that those aren’t interpreted.

  In determining the implementation level, HITRUST dynamically sets requirements for each organization and each assessment. Like the CSF more broadly, it’s a standardized process for determining implementation level.


  ### CSF Degrees of Assurance

  HITRUST offers 3 different Degrees of Assurance, which are essentially levels of assessment. The Degrees of Assurance align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds on the one below. For reference, Datica has completed a CSF Certified assessment, which is the highest Degree of Assurance.

  The following options exist for Degrees of Assurance, starting with the least cost, effort, time, and rigor.

  1. **Self Assessment.** This is simply an organization completing CSF on its own. It is valuable, typically as an internal tool for the organization, because it’s done again a standardized framework. There are no external parties that verify any aspects of the assessment. It results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self Assessment Report.

  2. **CSF Validated.** This, and the CSF Certified option below, requires a 3rd party CSF Assessor to verify the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment. The CSF Assessor is [approved](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/) by HITRUST. This Degree of Assurance requires an onsite visit by the CSF Assessor. HITRUST reviews the completed and validated assessment and issues a Validated Report as the outcome.

  3. **CSF Certified** Similar to the CSF Validated assessment, the organization undergoing the assessment is granted a HITRUST CSF Certification that is good for two years. The major differences for this Degree of Assurance is that the organization granted HITRUST CSF Certification meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the entries of the organization and the validation of the 3rd party assessor. In the case of Datica, this final step for certification took 3-4 months.


  ### PCI for Healthcare

  There are parallels between HITRUST and PCI. For those that are not familiar, PCI is the compliance framework for the financial and payments processing industry. Achieving PCI compliance is very involved, similar to a Certified HITRUST Assessment. Whereas HIPAA was written and is technically enforced by the federal government (HHS specifically), the CSF was written and is maintained by HITRUST, which is [governed](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/) by a representative body from the healthcare industry.

  In many ways, HITRUST is an attempt by the healthcare industry to create a standardized, PCI-like certification. In terms of enforcement, the healthcare industry, as opposed to HHS, is meant to enforce HITRUST by requiring Certified Assessments of business associates and subcontractors. There are still gaps in adoption within the healthcare industry, but the tide is clearly turning as more and more entities are expecting vendors to be HITRUST CSF Certified.


  ### HITRUST vs HIPAA

  As mentioned above, HITRUST builds on HIPAA. It takes HIPAA, a non-standardized and non-prescriptive compliance framework, and creates a standardized compliance framework, assessment, and certification process for the healthcare industry. In the process it “harmonizes” HIPAA with other compliance frameworks such as PCI and NIST. HITRUST also adapts requirements for certification to the risks of an organization based on organizational, system, and regulatory factors.

  As opposed to HIPAA, which has defined penalties for security breaches, the enforcement of HITRUST is dependent on the healthcare industry itself, typically covered entities like hospitals and payers, requiring HITRUST CSF Certification of vendors. HITRUST has gained adoption quickly in healthcare and we are seeing it more and more as an expectation for vendors. While not always required as a step in implementing a new technology, HITRUST certainly streamlines the security and compliance step in the implementation process.

  Having been through both HIPAA audits and a Certified CSF Assessment, it is safe to say that HITRUST CSF Certification is a much more rigorous process, with a higher burden of proof put on the organization trying to achieve certification, than a HIPAA audit. Achieving HITRUST CSF Certification requires significantly more time, effort, and resources than a HIPAA audit. Being HITRUST CSF Certified should be seen as a more significant badge for security and compliance than completing a HIPAA audit.

'
  :post: |
    Major organizations in healthcare, currently [United Healthcare](http://www.uhc.com/), [HCSC](http://www.hcsc.com/), [Highmark](https://www.highmark.com/hmk2/index.shtml), [Anthem](https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/home/overview), and [Humana](https://www.humana.com/) will require HITRUST CSF Certification in all business associate and partner agreements. Those requirements apply to both new and existing contracts. In addition, ten pediatric hospitals are strongly encouraging all of their vendors to become HITRUST CSF Certified. This is a major shift that was done in an effort to reduce the exceptional redundancy and flawed-fraught current process of doing one-off reviews for every vendor.

    Many may be asking themselves what HITRUST is and what this means exactly, and as [HIPAA compliance](/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer) experts, we’re here to answer your questions since we have achieved HITRUST CSF Certification. And as [Dr. Good](/about/travis) says:

    > If I’m being honest, I’d tell you that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly hard. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Catalyze Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected. I’ve experienced HIPAA from multiple angles - as a technical auditor, as a mobile app vendor, as a clinician, and as a compliant platform vendor - but I learned more about compliance from this HITRUST experience than anything I’ve done before. But, that’s all the more reason to be excited about this announcement! HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology bring great value to our customers. I’m ecstatic because our HITRUST CSF Certification will help our customers prove their applications and data are secure. It’s more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits.

  :summary: 'HIPAA attestation is everywhere but are they really compliant? Companies
    can self-attest to HIPAA compliance because there are no HIPAA certifications. '
  :post: "> I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger
    to my father. He said he wanted more proof. - Rodney Dangerfield\n\nAnybody can,
    and many companies do, put \"HIPAA Compliant\" on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to [selling software](https://datica.com/whitepapers/making-enterprise-healthcare-sales-easier/)
    that processes, stores, transmits, or somehow touches [ePHI](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/).
    It's an essential, though non-differentiating, feature of any B2B healthcare technology
    product. The reason companies can self-attest to being HIPAA compliant is that
    there isn't a certifying body, or accompanying certification, for HIPAA. That's
    problematic for both _vendors_ making and selling healthcare software to enterprises
    and _enterprises_ buying software from third party vendors. Let's talk briefly
    about those two camps.\n\n* **Vendors.** Compliance is a challenge because vendors
    constantly answer the same questions over and over again, though often phrased
    differently or in different formats (word docs vs spreadsheets). They often must
    provide different forms of evidence for each of these reviews. Not having evidence,
    or not having validated (externally audited) evidence, can slow the process and
    extend sales and implementation cycles.\n\n* **Enterprises.** Compliance is problematic
    for enterprises because they need to collect and review different forms of evidence
    and responses to questions from vendors. This takes time, does not typically leave
    security and compliance groups with lots of confidence since the evidence is so
    scattered and largely self-attested. Angst is often created between business buyers
    and compliance groups.\n\nThe end result is an inefficient process of security
    and compliance reviews where vendors and enterprises essentially reinvent the
    wheel for every new relationship. It's akin to how EHR integrations work today
    in that every new contract for a vendor or enterprise is like creating a new point-to-point
    relationship. Similarly, it can be a big stumbling block for vendors, especially
    smaller ones that have a hard time absorbing the cost of longer sales cycles.\n\n\n##
    HIPAA vs PCI\n\nThe financial industry, in contrast to healthcare, created a standardized
    certification for processing financial transactions or storing financial data.
    The [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2-0#pci_dss_v2-0)
    is a set of rules and requirements that can be tested, with passing resulting
    in certification to process financial transactions. Financial organizations and
    vendors work with a [qualified security assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php)
    in order to be certified. As opposed to HIPAA, organizations cannot self-attest
    to being \"PCI Compliant.\"\n\nThe reason for the differences between the financial
    industry (PCI) and the healthcare industry (HIPAA) is that PCI was created and
    is maintained by the private sector. If you look at who governs PCI, it's almost
    all the [large financial institutions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/organization_info/executive-committee.php).
    Essentially PCI is self-governing. HIPAA, in contrast, was created and is maintained
    by Health and Human Services (HHS), a government agency responsible for many different
    areas of healthcare. HIPAA is [interpreted and enforced](https://datica.com/blog/whos-really-interpreting-and-enforcing-hipaa-for-startups/)
    by non-government organizations and not HHS.\n\nChange is coming in healthcare
    that will make HIPAA more like PCI. The changes are represented in the new compliance
    framework and certification called [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).\n\nHITRUST,
    like PCI, is [governed by a board made up of large private sector healthcare organizations](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/)
    like Anthem and United Healthcare. HITRUST maintains the [Common Security Framework
    (CSF)](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/), which is
    essentially a PCI DSS for healthcare and HIPAA. Similarly to PCI, HITRUST CSF
    Certifications are granted to organizations that complete the CSF, have the results
    validated by an [approved third party assessor](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/),
    and then are verified by HITRUST itself. The resulting form of evidence is a certification
    and standard report. Datica has been through the HITRUST process and is awaiting
    final verification from HITRUST.\n\n\n## How to Prove HIPAA Compliance\n\nDifferent
    paths can lead to HIPAA compliance. To be clear, we're talking about proving compliance
    with HIPAA as part of an enterprise (payer and provider system) deployment. We've
    outlined a couple of options below. We have personal experience with each path,
    and have Datica customers that fit into each, so we feel confident discussing
    the pros and cons of each.\n\n\n### Path 1 - Self Assessments\n\nThe first option
    does not require third party verification or auditing. Not shockingly, self assessments
    are the easiest and least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show
    compliance with HIPAA.\n\nDownsides proliferate, however. The inspiration that
    led to the formation of Datica was based on our experience trying to sell modern,
    cloud based software as part of a previous venture; it's also important to note
    this was just before the new HIPAA Omnibus Rules went into effect in late 2013.
    We were selling to large healthcare enterprises (mostly academic - UCSF, University
    of Colorado, etc) and trying to prove compliance with HIPAA based on our own assessment.
    We were spending the majority of our time configuring our technology and updating
    our policies and internal procedures in order to deploy our technology and complete
    sales. All that time, effort, and work was going into things that our users would
    never see or appreciate. It's the reason we built Datica and the reason we [open
    sourced our policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/).\n\n\n####
    Supporting Documentation\n\nWithout official audit reports you must illustrate
    your compliance story through hand-crafted documentation. You can simply respond
    to compliance questionnaires with specific technical settings, but you may also
    have to provide some form of proof (like screenshots of settings or links to policies).\n\nA
    better approach is to use some type of framework to pre-compile answers to questions
    around HIPAA. The best framework to use is the [Audit Program Protocol](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/protocol.html)
    from OCR (part of HHS). Companies complete this framework to at minimum identify
    existing gaps before talking to compliance officers. Another option is to complete
    the [Common Security Framework (CSF)](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/)
    from HITRUST. This is more involved and takes more time than the OCR framework
    but provides a standardized report (not a spreadsheet you created yourself for
    the OCR framework). Self-assessing with HITRUST also has a cost, whereas the OCR
    framework is free.\n\nBe prepared to answer many questions. You will need both
    technology settings and policies to prove compliance. You need to assure technology
    (things like backup and DR) and internal procedures (things like training) are
    in line.\n\nWe've been through [multiple third party audits](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    at Datica. Based on that experience, we discovered transparency and proactive
    approaches to HIPAA have value for everyone. We decided to publish our [policies](https://policy.datica.com/)
    and our [mappings to HIPAA](https://hipaa.datica.com/). The HIPAA page is very
    close to a web page representation of the OCR audit framework linked above. If
    you're interested in leveraging our design for these pages, please [let us know](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to provide you with the code to host it yourself. Also, both
    our policy page and HIPAA page are dynamically generated by Github repos, which
    serve as the master source and provide a great form of version control (good for
    an audit). Our policies are written in Markdown for simplicity.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Less upfront time and effort\n* Lower cost\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* Can derail (or drastically
    slow) sales process\n* A lot more effort during the sales process (it will require
    a lot more time learning about HIPAA to respond to questions)\n\n\n### Path 2
    - Full third party audits\n\nAudits are not fun. Audits are not cheap. \n\nIn
    a previous life, Datica's CEO, [Travis Good](https://datica.com/about/travis/),
    conducted technology assessments for HIPAA audits in addition to Datica completing
    three external audits. We feel we have a good understanding of the process and
    value. Despite the effort and cost, audits are the single best way to streamline
    the security and compliance portion of the sales process.\n\nWe fully realize
    audits aren't an option for many smaller organizations. We are often asked \"when
    should I do an audit?\" and \"do I have to do an audit to close a deal?\" The
    answer to the latter question is an emphatic _No_, you don't have to do an audit
    to close a deal with a healthcare enterprise. The answer to the former is harder
    to answer. Of current non-enterprise Datica customers, less than 5% have done
    external audits (we think this is fantastic, actually).\n\nVendors typically do
    audits once they have about 4-5 enterprises customers. At this point companies
    shift to scaling sales based on lessons learned from early reference customers.
    It may have taken 12-24 months to acquire the initial 4-5 customers; acquiring
    the next 8-10 customers must be faster. Scaling sales means adding more sales
    agents, many of which won't have the same experience selling and answering questions
    about security and compliance; in this context, audit reports are empowering to
    sales people. Also, organizations with 4-5 customers typically have more resources.
    All those factors seem to push vendors over the tipping point of doing an external
    audit. The audit is a tool to help vendors accelerate and scale sales efforts.
    Maybe the best way to answer the question around when to do an audit is to say
    that doing an audit makes sense when security and compliance is the main bottleneck
    for sales.\n\n\n#### Supporting Documentation\n\nWhile you may still have to answer
    questions from each customer about security and compliance, providing your audit
    reports will go a long way to circumventing long, drawn out security and compliance
    reviews. On many occasions, you may only get asked about gaps that exist in your
    audit reports. Oftentimes those gaps will have associated remediation plans and
    you may get asked if gaps have been remediated. In essence, you've proven compliance
    to third party auditors so there's a lower burden of proof for your customers.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Speeds up sales process\n* Puts less of a burden on internal resources (sales
    and tech) to be well versed in HIPAA\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* It's expensive and time consuming\n*
    They do become out of date so need to assure you revisit, likely annually\n\n\n####
    Types of audits\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance
    frameworks that you can be audited against:\n\n1. HIPAA (from HHS)\n2. HITRUST\n\nWe've
    done both at Datica. We started with HIPAA, as our auditors recommended, and then
    moved on to HITRUST. We began with a HIPAA gap assessment, which most auditing
    firms will recommend if it's your first audit. Basically a gap assessment is lighter
    weight in terms of verifying things and is meant to, as the name implies, identify
    gaps in your compliance and security programs when mapping those programs to HIPAA
    rules. Once you know the gaps you can address them, or mitigate them if they can't
    be addressed for some reason. From there, a full HIPAA audit is a lot easier and
    holds a much higher chance of success.\n\nOnce we'd completed our gap assessment,
    addressed our gaps, and then completed our HIPAA audit, we did our HITRUST audit.
    The official term for that a Validated HITRUST Assessment. We opted to complete
    the HITRUST assessment because:\n\n1. More enterprises were asking about it\n2.
    A strong security and compliance program and culture at Datica is important\n3.
    It is a valuable tool for our customers in their sales process\n\nAs opposed to
    HIPAA audits, which are somewhat customized by each auditing firm, HITRUST has
    created one framework (the CSF linked above) that all entities are assessed against.
    It doesn't matter if you're small or large, the framework is the same. Some variability
    exists around the scope of a HITRUST audit as there are certain aspects of security
    and compliance that apply to some organizations and not others. HITRUST also has
    the concept of risk levels which determine the extent of questions organizations
    need to answer and prove. The bank of questions and resulting report are standardized.
    It is a true certification, as opposed to HIPAA.\n\nFor us, the HITRUST assessment
    involved two site visits and completing 278 different question areas. Each question
    area required attestation of 5 different maturity levels and each maturity level
    required some form of justification and/or proof. Also, many questions required
    additional comments to add context and specificity for how the question area fit
    with Datica. Taking out the comments and back and forth as HITRUST and our auditors
    reviewed our responses, that's just under 7,000 responses. Completing the 7,000
    HITRUST entries was made more painful by the incredibly slow (think spinning pinwheel)
    response times in the CSF web app.\n\nOther certification-type frameworks exist,
    like the [DIRECT certification](http://www.directtrust.org/becoming-accredited/)
    and Meaningful Use. These can be used as a proxy for an audit, as they do assess
    certain aspects of security and compliance programs, but these don't hold as much
    weight as HIPAA or HITRUST audits.\n\n#### Cost of an audit\n\nCost is a common
    question. This is too broad a topic to completely cover here because the [real
    cost of audits](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) involves more than the
    direct cost. For example, try to estimate the cost of completing 7,000 entries
    in a slow web app for a sense of the indirect costs.\n\nMost want to know the
    direct costs, which is easier to compute. From our experience, and those of customers
    and contacts at other modern tech vendors, the average cost of audits is about
    $20,000 for a HIPAA gap assessment, $20,000-$25,000 for a full HIPAA audit, and
    $30,000-$35,000 for a Validated HITRUST Assessment (includes both auditor's fees
    the the licensing fee to HITRUST). Variability exists from audit firm to audit
    firm but these prices are consistently what we hear.\n\n\n### Path 3 - Middle
    Road: Inheriting Proof\n\nIf you've gotten this far, chances are neither Path
    1 or 2 above appeal to you. Path 1 is easy but can kill sales. Path 2 is expensive,
    extremely time consuming, and you might run out of money before you start selling.
    We've been in your shoes. When we sat down as a team and decided to build Datica,
    pivoting out of our previous venture, neither Path 1 or 2 seemed terribly appealing
    to us.\n\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier way to
    build modern healthcare technology, practice modern development practices, comply
    with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert, and to prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nAs technology has evolved and computing
    has become distributed, driven largely by easy-to-use cloud platforms and APIs,
    different requirements of HIPAA are getting distributed across partner organizations.
    It's why HHS expanded who is covered under HIPAA to include [subcontractors](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-subcontractors-and-baas/).
    Covered entities work with business associates who in turn work with one to many
    subcontractors. In this brave new world, certain requirements under HIPAA are
    inherited by business associates from their subcontractors.\n\nThe industry has
    proven our early assumptions. Many customers utilize our audit reports, policy
    page, and HIPAA mappings as the cornerstone of their compliance programs. These
    resources, collectively what we refer to as a **HIPAA Sales Package**, are a core
    part of the value that we provide to our customers. We've spent 1,000s of hours
    on security and compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training,
    etc) and $10,000s on audits so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our
    customers inherit our work and our expertise, making compliance and trust a core
    part of their products. In fact, several of our customers have told us they've
    delayed audits because they leverage Datica.\n\nWhen our customers do decide to
    go down the path of doing a full audit, we help them in the process and make it
    less time consuming for them. Since we've been through multiple HIPAA and HITRUST
    audits, our customers give their auditors our documentation and audit reports
    to show evidence of certain aspects of HIPAA. \n\nHow is Path 3 different from
    Path 1 and other compliant cloud options? If you've built and configured your
    own technology on a traditional hosting vendor like AWS, you're going to have
    to prove every aspect of HIPAA compliance. You can point to the hosting vendors
    SOC2 (other audit reports) and BAA, but those only a address a small subset of
    the HIPAA rules like physical security. All other aspects of HIPAA, from a technical
    perspective, is yours to prove. The same goes for the admin side of HIPAA, though
    this is typically less important to security and compliance groups that the technical
    rules. With Path 3, we offer a fully audited platform and address more of HIPAA
    than any other option.\n\n\n## Choices, choices, choices\n\nIn the end, the path
    you choose to prove HIPAA is up to you and will be driven by your available resources,
    both financial and human. We've focused here more on the technical requirements
    of HIPAA, but the administrative side is also relevant. Completely addressing
    both the technical and administrative side of is necessary to proving compliance
    with HIPAA.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how we can help with
    the technical aspects of HIPAA, don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com).
    If you have specific questions about any of this, please let us know and we'd
    be happy to respond."

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica.com/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica.com/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica.com/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout
    drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n### HITRUST
    Essentials\n* [The HITRUST Guide](https://datica.com/guide/hitrust/)\n* [What
    is HITRUST?](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/)\n* [What is the HITRUST
    Framework?](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework)\n* [The Purpose

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
