:summary: This guide is intended to give developers a simple way to configure their
  Cosmos DB service to be HITRUST CSF ready. In this guide we’ll walk through the
  requirements, controls, and configurations for Azure Cosmos DB.
:lead: This guide is intended to give developers an easy to understand, step by step
  run book to configuring their Azure Cosmos DB instance to be HITRUST CSF ready.
  In the following sections we’ll walk through the requirements, controls, and configurations
  for Cosmos DB.
:post: "_Disclaimer: while utilizing these guides can provide alignment with HITRUST,
  it is still your responsibility as an organization to complete an audit and obtain
  certification._\n\n## Step 1: The Business Associate Agreement (BAA)\n\nFrom Microsoft:\n\n>
  “To help customers comply with HIPAA and the HITECH Act, Microsoft includes execution
  of the HIPAA BAA as part of a customer’s volume licensing agreement, which includes
  any agreement that incorporates the Online Services Terms by reference. The BAA
  (full text of which is available at [http://aka.ms/BAA](http://aka.ms/BAA)) applies
  to a customer that is a “covered entity” or a “business associate” and includes
  \"protected health information\" in Customer Data. Microsoft currently offers the
  BAA for the services listed in the Scope section below.”\n\nMicrosoft does not provide
  programmatic access to their BAA (at least none that we could find). To double check
  that you do in fact have a BAA in place with Microsoft, it’s recommended that you
  reach out to your Azure rep (or Azure support if you do not have a rep). \n\nMore
  general tips on BAAs [here](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
  \n\n| HIPAA Rule     | API Reference     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| HIPAA
  &sect; 164.308       | N/A: Azure does not provide API access to the BAA       |\n\n##
  Step 2: Creating the database\n\nInside of the Azure portal, find the search bar
  and type “*Cosmos DB*”. Once the results populate, click the “*Azure Cosmos DB*”
  service in the list.\n\n<img class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"Azure Cosmos DB service
  list\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2DBCBDXJYM6CkuQG4WmSCU/47e457b5a970f90bfc4b969559d5a1d4/cosmos-1.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=800\"
  data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2DBCBDXJYM6CkuQG4WmSCU/47e457b5a970f90bfc4b969559d5a1d4/cosmos-1.png?fm=png&fl=png8\"
  />\n\nFor compliant services, it’s recommended that you create a new resource group,
  or, if you have other compliant services, that you keep them together. The rule
  of thumb here is that services touching PHI should be separate from services not
  touching PHI.\n\nOnce you’re inside the “*Create Azure Cosmos DB Account*” page,
  follow below:\n\n1. Select your subscription and associated resource group\n2. Give
  the instance a name (“*Account name*”)\n3. Select your API\n4. Select the location
  in which you want the service to live. It’s recommended that you keep it in the
  same location with the other services that will be interacting with it\n5. Ensure
  both “*Geo-Redundancy*” and “*Multi-region Writes*” are enabled\n6. Click “*Next:
  Network*”\n7. On the network tab, we can see that we have the option to create a
  network. Click the “*Create a new virtual network*” link. In the right sidebar,
  give your new network a name. We’ll also want to create a new subnet. Pick a name
  and IP address in CIDR notation.\n\n<img class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"Networking
  options\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2Z546yr0DYSAik6a0qgSAQ/b61c2dec992ad914897aa06f04e6ae69/cosmos-2.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=800\"
  data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2Z546yr0DYSAik6a0qgSAQ/b61c2dec992ad914897aa06f04e6ae69/cosmos-2.png?fm=png&fl=png8\"
  />\n\nFollow the rest of the steps for database setup and finish creation.\n\n<img
  class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"Final setup steps\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5gJCxn9ZcAgIEWMasKiiaC/7b00a8d9ea2f6372dc8b55f12b907453/cosmos-3.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=800\"

  />\n\n## Step 3: Networking\n\nIn Step 2 above we created a new VPC as well as a
  subnet. See the reference below to see how to check this via the Azure REST API
  and how it relates to HITRUST.\n\n| Related Control(s)     | API Reference     |\n|
  ---------- | ---------- |\n| HITRUST 0805.01m1 Organizational.12       | [Subnets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/subnets)
  \      |\n\n## Step 4: Redundancy\n\nIn Step 2 above we created a database with
  several configurations. Two of those configurations were enabling both “*Geo-Redundancy*”
  and “*Multi-region Writes*”. To interact with these configurations, see the API
  reference below.\n\n| Related Control(s)     | API Reference     |\n| ----------

  \      |\n\n## Step 5: Access\n\nGating access to your database is imperative to
  achieving compliance. Cosmos DB supports a concept called “Service Endpoints”. From
  Azure:\n\n> “Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network
  private address space and the identity of your VNet to the Azure services, over
  a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources
  to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always
  remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.”\n\nAzure provides a step by step
  guide to for securing access to an Azure Cosmos DB account by using Azure Virtual
  Network service endpoint, so instead of rehashing those steps here, you should follow
  that guide.\nThose settings, if done correctly, will ensure your database is only
  being accessed by approved services within your Azure account.\n\n| Related Control(s)

  \      |\n\n## Step 6: Encryption\n\nFrom Azure:\n\n> “As a PaaS service, Cosmos
  DB is very easy to use. Because all user data stored in Cosmos DB is encrypted at
  rest and in transport, you don't have to take any action.”\n\nFor more information
  on how encryption at rest is implemented for Cosmos DB, [see this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/database-encryption-at-rest).\n\nEnsuring
  encryption is on everywhere:\n\nFor encryption and access not already covered in
  step 5, [see this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data)
  from Azure on securing point access to your Cosmos DB instance.\n\n| Related Control(s)

  [Available Endpoint Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/availableendpointservices)
  \      |\n\n## Step 7: Backups\n\nAzure provides automatic backups for Cosmos DB
  without the need to configure any settings. However, working with those backups,
  and attesting to their availability can be cumbersome. From Azure:\n\n> “All your
  backups are stored separately in another storage service, and those backups are
  globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters. The automatic backups
  are intended for scenarios when you accidentally delete your Cosmos DB container
  and later require data recovery or a disaster recovery solution.”\n\n| Related Control(s)

  Step 8: Logging & Monitoring\n\nInside of the Azure Cosmos DB portal, you’ll find
  a link in the left side navigation that reads “*Activity log*”, this is where you’ll
  see an audit log of various activity performed on the instance.\n\n<img class=\"lozad
  tofigure\" alt=\"Monitoring panel\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1UkPX9b0QMY82AGIAe6OI/c4d0fbd685ba8b359b2cea86515a0dc7/cosmos-4.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=800\"

  />\n\nMonitoring on the other hand has its own section, where you can see specific
  metrics about the instance, configure alerts, and run diagnostics.\n\n<img class=\"lozad
  tofigure\" alt=\"Cosmos DB diagnostics\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3Xpjhm1FPi8EkkYuWAeYae/cf140a76f41a5c27dc853c5eb41d1b85/cosmos-5.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=800\"

  \      |\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nUsing this guide, developers can ensure their new
  Cosmos DB instance is ready to comply with the HITRUST CSF. Maintaining these configurations
  for all new infrastructure, updating them for new versions of HITRUST and providing
  proof — a digital papertrail — is an incredible amount of work. Having a partner
  like Datica can mean the difference between an audit taking 4 months, or 4 weeks.\n\nFor

    for RDS.
  :post: |-
    _Disclaimer: while utilizing these guides can provide alignment with HITRUST, it is still your responsibility as an organization to complete an audit and obtain certification._

    ## Step 1: Ensuring you have a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

    First and foremost, you’ll need a [BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/) in place with AWS before configuring any service (and subsequently accepting PHI). AWS maintains a list of services that are covered under their BAA [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/) (RDS included). If you haven’t signed a BAA already with AWS, please see the steps below. If you already have a BAA with AWS, simply move on to step 2.

    More information on BAAs from AWS can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-the-self-service-business-associate-addendum/).

    <img class="lozad tofigure" alt="Setting up a BAA" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5WuZ9O1zMcCcy2YwIamSMg/80cfaebfaa4f32c41cf3f49fa5903949/rds-1.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5WuZ9O1zMcCcy2YwIamSMg/80cfaebfaa4f32c41cf3f49fa5903949/rds-1.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    To sign the AWS BAA...

    1. Navigate to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/)
    2. Select the “AWS Business Associate Addendum” section
    3. Download the AWS Business Associate Addendum
    4. Confirm you’ve followed the steps properly by checking the three boxes show on the screen
    5. Click the button that says “Accept the AWS Business Associate Addendum for this account”
    6. You now have a BAA in place with AWS

    | Rule     | API Reference     |
    | ---------- | ---------- |
    | HIPAA &sect; 164.308       | N/A: AWS does not provide API access to their Artifact service       |

    ## Step 2: Selecting a database version

    Because AWS RDS offers various versions of each database, it’s imperative from a compliance and security perspective that you select a known good patched version, and one that will continue to receive updates and patches in the future (using versions no older than 3 previous versions is typically a safe bet).

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="RDS: Selecting a database version" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4r27J6VIEE4eAEIQ4KI4ky/63e34d3ae56d32fdc45f37a38e8f8293/rds-2.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4r27J6VIEE4eAEIQ4KI4ky/63e34d3ae56d32fdc45f37a38e8f8293/rds-2.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ## Step 3: Create new subnet group

    From AWS:

    > “Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that you designate to group your resources based on security and operational needs. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB instances. A DB subnet group allows you to specify a particular VPC when creating DB instances using the CLI or API; if you use the console, you can just select the VPC and subnets you want to use.”

    How to create a new subnet group:

    1. Search for or choose “*RDS*” in the AWS console (or if you’re following along in this guide find the “*Subnet group*” link in the left side navigation).
    2. Select the “*Subnet group*” link if you haven’t already
    3. Select “*Create DB Subnet Group*”
    4. Complete the information for name and description
    5. Select your VPC and all subnets related to this VPC
    6. Select “*Create*”

    <img class="lozad tofigure" alt="Creating a new subnet group" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3xeX4ZhkPYysm2CuIIKEKi/eb3d15faec2fd9ec6866fded805e82f8/rds-3.gif?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3xeX4ZhkPYysm2CuIIKEKi/eb3d15faec2fd9ec6866fded805e82f8/rds-3.gif" />

    ## Step 4: Enable multi-AZ

    When creating your new RDS instance, ensure you have selected “*Create replica in different zone*” as high availability and replication is critical to businesses handling PHI &mdash; you’ll also see in the table below the relevance to various required HITRUST controls.

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Enabling multi-AZ" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3txkWTfv5CwqaKc4cEkKSC/dc3afde2ba3fc156537e72f833a8fbc3/rds-4.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3txkWTfv5CwqaKc4cEkKSC/dc3afde2ba3fc156537e72f833a8fbc3/rds-4.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ## Step 5: Create security group

    Communication should be limited to only the two VPC networks. No other access should be granted. To create a new Security group, [follow this guide from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#CreatingSecurityGroups).

    ## Step 6: Turn off public access

    It should go without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: providing public, unauthorized, access to PHI (either directly or indirectly) is a violation of HIPAA, HITRUST, and several other regimes. Ensuring your RDS instance has public access turned off is critical.

    To turn off public access do the following:

    1. If you’re already in the RDS console and following along as you create a new instance, on Step 3 of creation, select “No” under the “Public accessibility” field <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Disabling public access" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4tWBvDKdcIa22EAC00ikiM/ffe8a7e493def8508c402cfd7953f288/rds-5.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4tWBvDKdcIa22EAC00ikiM/ffe8a7e493def8508c402cfd7953f288/rds-5.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />
    2. ...or if you have an instance already, simply click the “*Instances*” link in the left side navigation from the main RDS console
    3. Select the RDS instance you want
    4. Once you have the instance selected, click the “*Modify*” button on the top right
    5. Then scroll to the “*Network & Security*” security section — here you will find the “*Public accessibility*” option
    6. Select “*No*”

    ## Step 7: Enable encryption

    Encryption is perhaps the most important of all controls that need to be in place on your database instance(s).

    To enable encryption on an RDS instance, [follow this guide from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Enabling).

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Enabling encryption" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5mnNkN0b5usYq86UsIgMUm/dab71a3d5b9b9789abf03cb289a29aa3/rds-6.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5mnNkN0b5usYq86UsIgMUm/dab71a3d5b9b9789abf03cb289a29aa3/rds-6.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ## Step 8: Working with backups

    From AWS:

    > “By default, Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance securely in Amazon S3 for a user-specified retention period.”

    If you’ve already set up an RDS instance without specifying the backup period, AWS states:

    > “You can set the backup retention period when you create a DB instance. If you don't set the backup retention period, the default backup retention period is one day if you create the DB instance using the Amazon RDS API or the AWS CLI, or seven days if you create the DB instance using the AWS Console”

    To set the retention period when creating a new RDS instance, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to your RDS console
    2. Select “*Instances*”
    3. Select “*Create database*”
    4. Go through the several steps, stop once you’re on the “*Configure advanced settings*” page
    5. Scroll to the “*Backup*” section and select your desired preferences

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Configuring backup settings" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/6i3g94kdZSiGiOIMwmYUUI/7394feea3da1c140f21c06536f0bad99/rds-7.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/6i3g94kdZSiGiOIMwmYUUI/7394feea3da1c140f21c06536f0bad99/rds-7.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ## Step 9: Patching schedule

    Managing vulnerabilities is a burden for users. Luckily, AWS provides maintenance as part of the RDS instance. In the “*Maintenance*” section on the “*Configure advanced settings*” step of creating an RDS instance, you’ll see two options:

    1. __Auto minor version upgrade__ &mdash; You should set this to “Enable auto minor version upgrade”
    2. __Maintenance window__ &mdash; For policy purposes, you’ll want/need to select a specific window. Recommendations on day and time will vary drastically depending on your location, business, and several other factors

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Setting up a schedule" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/Nq2e3iCIYUQQ4yYqE466S/5971449c0756f1cedeae67d3464b4770/rds-8.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/Nq2e3iCIYUQQ4yYqE466S/5971449c0756f1cedeae67d3464b4770/rds-8.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ## Step 10: Working with SSL

    “Encrypting everything” is often the most difficult aspect of complying with frameworks like HITRUST CSF. Ensuring that your connections to RDS are encrypted is a fundamental requirement. The best way to enforce encryption for your RDS instance is to force all connections to use SSL.

    The steps required to enforcing SSL on your database will vary depending on your database of choice. For more information and step by step guides, see the following articles from AWS:

    - [MariaDB SSL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.SSLSupport)
    - [MySQL SSL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.SSLSupport)

    ## Step 11: Audit Logging & Monitoring

    ### Monitoring

    Enhanced monitoring can be turned on for RDS at time of creation. On the “*Configure advanced settings*” step, find the “*Monitoring*” section and select “*Enable enhanced monitoring*”.

    <img class="lozad tofigure content-screenshot" alt="Enabling enhanced monitoring" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2wzKtvxtZya0Oi28kQ6m8S/50c2bdd4e0eec79bc0ad54b7073c7d8d/rds-9.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2wzKtvxtZya0Oi28kQ6m8S/50c2bdd4e0eec79bc0ad54b7073c7d8d/rds-9.png?fm=png&fl=png8" />

    ### Logging

    From AWS:

    > “RDS PostgreSQL generates query and error logs. We write auto-vacuum info and rds_admin actions to the error log”

    AWS has several articles detailing how logging and monitoring work together to give you transparency into your instance. For more information, [see this guide from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Monitoring.html).

    ## Wrapping up

    Using this guide, developers can ensure their new RDS instance is ready to comply with the HITRUST CSF. Maintaining these configurations for all new infrastructure, updating them for new versions of HITRUST and providing proof &mdash; a digital papertrail &mdash; is an incredible amount of work. Having a partner like Datica can mean the difference between an audit taking 4 months, or 4 weeks.

  :summary: This guide helps developers configure their Google Cloud SQL instance
    to be HITRUST CSF ready. It covers requirements, controls, and configurations
    for GCP Cloud SQL.
  :lead: This guide is intended to give developers an easy to understand, step by
    step run book to configuring their Google Cloud SQL instance to be HITRUST CSF
    ready. In the following sections we’ll walk through the requirements, controls,
    and configurations for GCP Cloud SQL.
  :post: "_Disclaimer: while utilizing these guides can provide alignment with HITRUST,
    it is still your responsibility as an organization to complete an audit and obtain
    certification._\n\n## Step 1: The Business Associate Agreement (BAA)\n\nGoogle
    Cloud Platform requires users to contact their account manager to get a BAA signed.
    From Google: \n\n> \"Execute a Google Cloud BAA. You can request a BAA directly
    from your account manager.\"\n\nOnly once you’ve signed the BAA and subsequently
    configured your SQL database to be compliant should you start accepting PHI.\n\nMore
    on BAAs can be found in the [Datica Academy](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\n|
    Rule     | Header     |\n| ---------- | ---------- |\n| HIPAA &sect; 164.308       |
    N/A: GCP does not provide an API to the BAA       |\n\n## Step 2: Working with
    VPC networks\n\nBefore we jump into creating our SQL instance, first we’re going
    to create a new VPC and subnet. Creating a network and a subnet is very simple
    with GCP. Follow these steps.\n\n1. In the left side navigation find \"*VPC network*\"
    under the \"*Networking*\" heading\n2. Above the table of default networks, click
    the \"*Create VPC network*\" button\n3. Fill out the name, and description fields
    and then select \"*Subnet creation mode*\" under the \"*Subnets*\" section\n4.
    In the box titled \"*New subnet*\" fill out a name\n5. The region should be the
    same region as the database\n6. For the IP address range, you should use a standard
    private VPC network address range\n7. For \"*Private google access*\" which indicates:
    \" *...whether VMs in this subnet can access Google services without assigning
    external IP addresses* \" select \"*Off*\"\n8. Set flow logs to \"*On*\"\n9. Set
    \"Dynamic routing mode\" to \"*Regional*\"\n10. Click \"*Create*\"\n\n| Related

    \      |\n\n## Step 3: Creating the database\n\nNow that we have a network and
    subnet, we can create our database. To do that, click the menu button in the top
    left and follow these steps:\n\n1. Select \"*SQL*\"\n2. At the following prompt,
    select \"*Create instance*\" <img class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"Creating a Cloud
    SQL instance\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/6tB9ogqgPCGImsOC4wiEcW/edfe8828e0505dc5685e5597b4558d59/cloudsql-1.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600\"

    />\n3. Make a selection for \"*MySQL*\" or \"*PostgreSQL*\" <img class=\"lozad
    tofigure\" alt=\"Choosing database type\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/6EVJDRf5D24UkwUK2q0eo8/43e673137e7b4d399e7bc9d2201e337a/cloudsql-2.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600\"

    />\n4. Enter the information for \"*Instance ID*\", \"*Default user password*\",
    \"*Location*\", \"*Region*\" and \"*Zone*\"\n5. Select the \"*Show configuration
    options*\" link\n6. Under \"*Set Connectivity*\" select \"*Private IP*\" (enable
    the API if you haven’t already)\n7. Under \"*Private IP*\" select the VPC we just
    created in the previous step <img class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"Private IP decisions\"
    src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/31gvagB55eqEaM0uMUsSUu/9b57729fdf6152b6f5c1f5bdd126c623/cloudsql-3.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600\"

    />\n8. If \"*Public IP*\" is checked be sure to uncheck it\n9. In the \"*Enable
    auto backups and high availability*\" section, select \"*Automate backups*\" \n10.
    In the same section under \"*Availability*\" select \"*High availability (regional)*\"\n11.
    Next, under the \"*Set maintenance schedule*\" section be sure to select the window
    and timing that’s appropriate for your internal policy\n12. Then click \"*Create*\"\n\n##
    Step 4: High availability\n\nIn the previous step where we created our database,
    we were able to setup high availability across multiple regions. This aids in
    both disaster recovery and business continuity for your organization. If a region
    within GCP goes down, high availability will ensure that your data is still accessible
    from another region. \n\nFor more information on high availability from the GCP,
    see this [article](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/high-availability).\n\n|

    Step 5: Database access & encryption\n\nWhen we created the database in step 3,
    we selected \"Private IP\" and unselected \"*Public IP*\". This restricts traffic
    to the instance only to approved networks. This is important because it forces
    all traffic to be encrypted and authenticated.\n\nMore information on Private
    IP can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip).\n\n###
    Connecting over SSL/TLS\n\nFrom Google:\n\n> \"If you are connecting using private
    IP, configuring SSL/TLS is optional; private services access traffic stays within
    Google's network at all times.\"\n\n<img class=\"lozad tofigure\" alt=\"SSL/TLS
    options\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5ryAolx2hyoeEyIcCUkAGe/5db42940b5947db917ac706569eee29b/cloudsql-4.png?fm=png&fl=png8&w=600\"

    /> \n\nYou can see in the screenshot above that all incoming connections must
    use SSL and also that we haven’t set up a certificate yet, which is covered in
    the guide below. For the purposes of this guide, SSL/TLS is not optional. To enforce
    a secure connection, [follow this guide](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance#enforcing-ssl).\n\n|

    in the \"operations\" tab. However, this still doesn’t get us all the way to HITRUST
    alignment. For auditing, we’re going to be using [Google Cloud Audit Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/).

    />\n\nFortunately Cloud Audit Logging is on by default, and can be accessed at
    [console.cloud.google.com/home/activity](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/activity).
    If you navigate to that page, you’ll see a log of activity, with options in the
    right menu to filter based on certain criteria.\n\n\n<img class=\"lozad tofigure\"

    GCP Cloud SQL instance is ready to comply with the HITRUST CSF. Maintaining these
    configurations for all new infrastructure, updating them for new versions of HITRUST
    and providing proof &mdash; a digital papertrail &mdash; is an incredible amount
    of work. Having a partner like Datica can mean the difference between an audit
    taking 4 months, or 4 weeks.\n\nFor more information on Datica’s products and

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
