  :description: Founded in 1987, Health Level Seven International (HL7) is a not-for-profit,
    ANSI-accredited standards developing organization dedicated to providing a comprehensive
    framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval
    of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the management,
    delivery and evaluation of health services.
  :url: http://hl7.org
:summary: 'The Medical Document Management (MDM) message is a commonly used HL7 message
  type that provides information about new or updated notes or documents. '
:post: "The Medical Document Management (MDM) message is a commonly used HL7 message
  type that provides information about new or updated notes or documents. Per the
  HL7 standard, it's main purpose is \"to produce an accurate, legal, and legible
  document that serves as a comprehensive account of healthcare services provided
  to a patient\".\n\nThere are several MDM message trigger events and they can be
  split into two categores - those that describe the status of the document and those
  that both describe the document and also contain the document itself:\n\n| MDM Subtype
  | Trigger Event/Description |\n|-------------|---------------------------|\n| T01
  | Original Document Notification |\n| T02 | Original Document Notification with
  Content |\n| T03 | Document Status Change Notification |\n| T04 | Document Status
  Change Notification with Content |\n| T05 | Document Addendum Notification |\n|
  T06 | Document Addendum Notification with Content |\n| T07 | Document Edit Notification
  |\n| T08 | Document Edit Notification with Content |\n| T09 | Document Replacement
  Notification |\n| T10 | Document Replacement Notification with Content | \n| T11
  | Document Cancel Notification |\n\n\nFollowing the standard HL7 message structure,
  an MDM message is made up of segments and groups of segments, each of which may
  be required, optional, repeatable, or some combination thereof. A quick note on
  reading HL7 message examples which seem to contain a bunch of [],{} etc. The general
  rule is as follows:\n- No brackets around it - **Required**\n- [] - **Optional**\n-
  { } - **Repeating**\n- [{ }] - **Optional Repeating**\n\nThe MDM message structure
  is as follows.\n```\nMDM     Medical Document Management Message\nMSH     Message
  Header\nPID     Patient Identification\n  [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments\nPV1   Patient
  Visit\n{[\n  ORC    Common Order\n  OBR Observation Request\n    [NTE]  Notes and
  Comments\n]}\nTXA Document Notification\n  [{NTE}] Notes and Comments\n{\n  OBX*
  Observation notes\n    [{NTE}] Notes and Comments\n}\n```\n\nSome notes on the above
  triggers and message structure:\n\n- The most common of the MDM subtypes is the
  T02 because it notifies the receiving system that a new document has been created
  and also includes the document content itself. One typical workflow will have a
  vendor write notes back into the EMR via an MDM^T02 so that the notes are loaded
  into a patient's chart and available for physician review.\n\n- The ORC/OBR segments
  are optional and are mostly only used for workflows like order-based transcriptions,
  where an order can be created or updated by the MDM message.\n\n- Note the asterisk
  (*) next to the OBX segment. That's there to indicate that MDM messages will only
  include repeating OBX segments if they include the document content itself. The
  content is stored in the OBX segment(s) in a format dictated by the receiving system.
  Some possible formats include: plain text, formatted text (ie. RTF), or base64-encoded
  documents like PDFs. The document can be split across multiple OBX segments or stored
  in one single OBX dependent on the preference of the receiving system or the character
  limits of each segment. \n\nNow let's break down an example MDM HL7 message by each
  segment. The message we want to send is: a note containing a consulting physician's
  (James A. Matthews) clinical diagnosis has been created and should be attached to
  a patient's chart. The patient is Mike J. Thomas: male, African American, MRN:12983718,
  SSN:123-45-9999, born on January 1, 1970, account number: 18273652.\n\nBased on
  this information, the required segments would be created as follows:\n\n**MSH -
  Message Header**\nLet's assume an all Epic environment, i.e. the sending and receiving
  systems are both Epic, and that the note is created on 2016/05/10 at 07:16:33. Also,
  the version of HL7 being used is v2.3. This would result in a segment that looks
  like this.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|Epic|Epic|||20160510071633||MDM^T02|12345|D|2.3\n```\n\n**PID
  - Patient Identification**\nHere we identify which patient this note is about. We
  include the patient's identifier, full name, DOB, sex, race, address, phone number(s),
  account number, SSN and place of birth. Some of these are optional as described
  in the format specification:\n\n```\nPID|1||12983718^^^^EPI||Thomas^Mike^J^^MR.^||19500101|M||AfrAm|506
  S. HAMILTON AVE^^MADISON^WI^53505^US^^^DN |DN|(608)123-9998|(608)123-5679||S||18273652|123-45-9999||||^^^WI^^\n```\n\n**PV1
  - Patient Visit**\nThis usually contains information on the admission information,
  attending, referring and consulting, admitting physician IDs and names and so on.
  We'll just keep it simple and just have the consulting physician's info:\n\n```\nPV1|||^^^CARE
  HEALTH SYSTEMS^^^^^||||||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^||||||||||||\n```\n\n**TXA - Document
  Notification**\nThe TXA segment contains information about the transcribed document
  including the report type, date/time, provider info, a unique document number assigned
  by the sending system (ex: 12345), and a document status (ex: PA = Pre-Authenticated):\n\n```\nTXA||CN||20160510071633|1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^|||||||^^12345|||||PA|\n```\n\n**OBX
  - Observation**\nOBX segment(s) contain the document content itself. Here, we'll
  split out document contents into multiple OBX segments for clarity though this isn't
  a requirement. The receiving system should dictate their preference. In this example,
  TX indicates the content will be in plain text:\n\n```\nOBX|1|TX|||Clinical summary:
  Based on the information provided, the patient likely has viral sinusitis  commonly
  called a head cold.\nOBX|2|TX|||Diagnosis: Viral Sinusitis\nOBX|3|TX|||Diagnosis
  ICD: J01.90\nOBX|4|TX|||Prescription: benzonatate (Tessalon Perles) 100mg oral tablet
  30 tablets, 5 days supply. Take one to two tablets by mouth three times a day as
  needed. disp. 30. Refills: 0, Refill as needed: no, Allow substitutions: yes\n```\n\nNow,
  putting them all together we get the full HL7 MDM message.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|Epic|Epic|||20160510071633||MDM^T02|12345|D|2.3\nPID|1||12983718^^^^EPI||Thomas^Mike^J^^MR.^||19500101|M||AfrAm|506

    Computing Total Cost of Ownership is an important project for any technology leader, but healthcare integrations pose a particularly challenging problem due to hidden process costs.

    When calculating the decision between building your own integrations versus working with a managed service provider, the 'right' answer is the best fitting solution dependent on organizational needs.

    The Datica guide to healthcare integration total cost of ownership will help give you the knowledge to determine your own TCO calculation. Included in the guide:

    - The integration process
    - People - roles and responsibilities
    - Components of work efforts and effort estimates

  :summary: 'The HL7 SIU and HL7 SRM message types are HL7 appointment scheduling
    messages with date and time, resources, services, location, and more appoint info. '
  :post: "The SIU (Schedule Information Unsolicited) and SRM (Schedule Request Message)
    messages contain information related to appointment scheduling. SRM messages are
    used for requesting changes to a health system's schedule, such as a request for
    a new appointment booking, appointment rescheduling, modification, cancellation,
    etc. SIU messages are used to notify auxiliary applications of a change made to
    the health system's schedule, such as a notification for the booking of a new
    appointment, appointment rescheduling, modification, cancellation, etc. Scheduling
    messages contain information about the appointment date and time, resources, services,
    location, and any other pertinent information regarding the appointment. The purpose
    or action prescribed by any scheduling message will depend entirely on the trigger
    event (See the List of Trigger Events below). \n\nFollowing the standard HL7 message
    structure, an SIU or SRM message is made up of segments and groups of segments,
    each of which may be required, optional, repeatable, or some combination thereof.
    A quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to contain a bunch of
    [],{} etc. The general rule is as follows:\n\n- No brackets around it - Required\n-

    \    Notes and Comments (for Personnel)\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\nThere are a few things
    to note about the message structures. As you may have already noticed, the structure
    of the two message types are virtually identical. We'll discuss that more later.
    For now, we will explore the shared features of both the SIU and SRM:\n\n- The
    Resource Group segment (RGS) is always required, and may contain more than one
    resource group. This segment acts as a header for the collection of resource segments
    that follow it.\n\n- Within a Resource Group, the Appointment Service Information
    (AIS) is the only required resource segment. This suggests that any new/requested
    appointment must have a scheduled service attached to it.\n\n- Note the presence
    of multiple (optional, repeatable) Diagnosis (DG1) segments. If repeated, the
    first will be the primary diagnosis.\n\n- Note the presence of the OBX (Observation)
    segment as an optional, repeatable segment. The use here is different from its
    use in the ORU (Observational Report - Unsolicited) message. When used, it contains
    notes and comments pertaining to the patient in much the same way an NTE segment
    would, rather than information about observations and results. For instance, the
    OBX segments may contain a Transcribed Report (TX) with patient information that
    may be relevant to the appointment. \n\nAs mentioned before, the only apparent
    difference between the structure of an SIU message and an SRM message is the second
    segment. The SIU message contains an **SCH** segment whereas the SRM message contains
    an **ARQ** segment. Even these two segments share most of the same fields. However,
    there are some key differences, notably:\n\n- **Date/Time Range**\n\tIn the SIU
    message, the SCH segment contains one field with all of the appointment timing/quantity
    information in one place (SCH.11). In the SRM message, the ARQ segment has four
    separate fields for appointment timing quantity. They consist of one required
    field for the requested start date/time range (ARQ.11) and the optional fields
    for appointment priority (ARQ.12), repeating interval (ARQ.13), and the interval
    duration (ARQ.14).\n\n- **Audit Trail Contacts**\n\tThe SIU message can contain
    the name, phone number, address, and location information for the person who \"placed\"
    the appointment (SCH.12 - SCH.15), the person who \"filled\" the appointment (SCH.16
    - SCH.19), and the person who \"entered\" the appointment (SCH.20 - SCH.22). As
    an SRM message is sent only when an appointment has not yet been filled, the ARQ
    segment only contains fields for the placer (ARQ.15 - ARQ.18) and enterer (ARQ.19
    - ARQ.21) of the appointment.\n\t\n- **Filler Status Code**\n\tThe status of the
    appointment is only present in SIU messages (SCH.25). This is, again, due to the
    fact that a scheduling request must be filled before it can have any status other
    than \"requested\".\n\nApart from the few differences between the SCH segment
    and the ARQ segment, there is no structural difference between an SIU message
    and an SRM message. However, the main difference between any two message types
    comes not from the structure of the message, but from the action prescribed by
    the different trigger events.\n\n### List of Trigger Events\n\nTrigger events
    for SRM:\n\n| Segment ID | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| S01
    | Request New Appointment Booking |\n| S02 | Request Appointment Rescheduling
    |\n| S03 | Request Appointment Modification |\n| S04 | Request Appointment Cancellation
    |\n\nTrigger Events for SIU:\n\n|Segment ID | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n|
    S12 | Notification of New Appointment Booking |\n| S13 | Notification of Appointment
    Rescheduling |\n| S14 | Notification of Appointment Modification |\n| S15 | Notification
    of Appointment Cancellation |\n| S26 | Notification that Patient did not show
    up for Scheduled Appointment |\n\n### Message Construction\n\nThe message I want
    to send is: A female, Caucasian patient, Jane Fredericks, MRN:30745109, SSN:321-87-6543
    born on May 1, 1973 and account number of 11396810 wants to schedule a new appointment
    to have an X-Ray taken of her ankle. The appointment request is being placed by
    Dr. James Matthews. The exact service to be performed is X-RAY ANKLE 3+ VW with
    the associated CPT code of 73610. This is based upon a diagnosis of Broken Ankle.
    Additional information that will need to be sent will include the appointment
    date and time, duration, sending and receiving systems, the version of HL7 being
    used etc. The request is approved and the hospital sends a notification for the
    new appointment booking.\n\nBased on this information, the segments would be created
    as follows:\n\n#### MSH - Message Header\nAssuming an all Epic environment i.e.
    sending and receiving systems are all Epic and request is created at 2016/05/02
    at 16:20:33. Version of HL7 being used is v2.3. Since this message is a notification
    for a new appointment booking, the message type is SIU and the trigger event is
    S12. This would result in a segment that looks like this.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|EPIC|EPIC|||20160502162033||SIU^S12|538|D|2.3||\n```\n\n####
    SCH\nThis contains all of the scheduling information - the placer and filler application's
    appointment identifiers, duration, start time, the person who requested the appointment,
    and the appointment status. To keep things simple, we'll only include the identifiers
    and required information.\n\n```\nSCH|01928374|57483920|||||||1|hr|1^^^20160515133000|||||||||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A|||||BOOKED\n```\n\n####
    PID - Patient Identification\nSince this message is a patient specific request,
    it needs all the associated patient info to prevent any confusion. This would
    include the patient's identifier, full name, DOB, sex, race, address, phone number(s),
    account number, SSN and place of birth.\n\n```\nPID|1||30745109^^^^EPI||FREDERICKS^JANE^I^^MRS.^||19730501|F||Cauc|421
    N. BAKER ST^^MADISON^WI^53513^US^^^DN|DN|(608)555-6789|(608)555-4321||S||11396810|321-87-6543||||^^^WI^^\n```\n\n####
    PV1 - Patient Visit\nThis usually contains information on the admission information,
    attending, referring and consulting, admitting physician IDs and names and so
    on. I'll just keep it simple and just have the attending physician's info in the
    sample giving us\n\n```\nPV1|||^^^CARE HEALTH SYSTEMS^^^^^||| |1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^||||||||||||610613||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||V\n```\n\n####
    DG1 - Diagnosis\nSome basic context needs to be provided so that the billing systems
    can do their work so diagnosis information is also provided. So in ICD10 (I10),
    ankle fracture is coded as S82.\n\n```\nDG1||I10|S82^ANKLE FRACTURE^I10|ANKLE
    FRACTURE||\n```\n\n#### RGS - Resource Group\nThis is brief header for the group
    of resource segments that follow it. Included is the number of the resource group,
    the action prescribed (here it's \"add\", or 'A'), and the group ID. This group
    ID may be used for modifying or rescheduling the resource group at a later date.\n\n```\nRGS|1|A|094\n```\n\n####
    AIS - Appointment Info. - Service\nThis contains information related to the scheduled
    service. In this case, it will be an X-Ray for the patient's ankle. Along with
    the CPT code for the scheduled service, the segment also contains the time the
    service is expected to start (may be different from the appointment start time)
    and the length of time the service will be needed.\n\n```\nAIS|1||73610^X-RAY
    ANKLE 3+ VW^CPT|20160515134500|15|min|45|min||\n```\n\n#### AIP - Appointment
    Info. - Personnel\nThis optional repeating segment identifies personnel needed
    for the appointment that are not explicitly mentioned anywhere else in the message.
    For the scheduled appointment, a radiologist (Allan Good) will be needed to perform
    the X-Ray. Just like the AIS segment, this segment contains the time the radiologist

  :summary: 'The Order Entry (ORM) message is a common HL7 message type. ORM messages
    contain information about an order, most commonly radiology or lab orders. '
  :lead: The Order Entry (ORM) message is one of the most commonly used HL7 message
    type. ORM messages contain information about an order. This includes placing new
    orders, canceling existing orders, discontinuation, holding, etc. Orders pertain
    to either materials (e.g., 1 liter of 0.9% saline) or services (e.g., a blood
    panel, etc.). Usually this is patient specific. The trigger event for this message
    is any change to an order i.e. order is created, modified, cancelled, put on hold
    and so on.
  :post: "Before we jump into ORM messages, a quick review might be in order. As we've
    discussed [before](/discover/ehr-integrations/), HL7 has many message types which
    can be very daunting. It's not only that there are messages but also that there
    are types of HL7 messages which are geared towards handling specific events. Admission,
    Discharge, Transfer (ADT) messages are sent when patient's are admitted, discharged
    or otherwise moved around the hospital. Scheduling (SIU) messages schedule and
    update appointments in clinics. Order Entry (ORM) messages are sent when orders
    are placed or edited and Order Result (ORU) messages are sent back with results
    that correspond to the original ORM message. These are the most common HL7 message
    types; most other workflows, like updating flowsheets or filing visit notes, use
    some combination of segments from these message types to accomplish their goals.
    Since we already covered the ADT message in detail [here](/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/),
    we thought we could move onto the Order Entry (ORM) message.\n\nAs mentioned earlier,
    an order is a request for material or services, usually for a specific patient.
    These could be anything ranging from medication orders, measuring of vitals, lab
    tests, specific food / dietary orders, radiology films. These could also be generic
    orders (not clinical or pertaining to patient) for materials required to keep
    the hospital running i.e. linens from housekeeping, supplies from central supply
    etc. If something needs to happen in a hospital or clinic, from printing a requisition
    to e-prescribing, orders distribute pertinent data from system to system.\n\nORM
    messages are most commonly used to send Radiology Orders and Lab Orders[1]. Following
    the standard HL7 message structure, an ORM message is made up of segments and
    groups of segments, each of which may be required, optional, repeatable, or some
    combination thereof. A quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to
    contain a bunch of [],{} etc. The general rule is as follows:\n- No brackets around
    it - **Required**\n- `[]` - **Optional**\n- `{ }` - **Repeating**\n- `[{ }]` -
    **Optional Repeating**\n\nThe ORM message structure is as follows.\n\n~~~javascript\nORM
    \    General Order Message\nMSH     Message Header\n [{NTE}]    Notes and Comments
    (for Header)\n[\n   PID     Patient Identification\n   [PD1]    Additional Patient
    Identification\n      [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments (for Patient ID)\n   [PV1    Patient
    Visit\n    [PV2|]   Patient Visit Additional Information\n    [{IN1   Insurance\n
    \     [IN2]   Insurance Additional Info\n   [IN3]   Insurance Additional Info\n
    \   }]\n    [GT1]   Guarantor\n    [{AL1}]   Allergy\n  ]\n]\n {\n   ORC    Common
    Order\n  [\n   Order Detail Segment OBR, etc.\n       [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments
    (for Detail)\n       [{DG1}]  Diagnosis\n       [\n        {\n         OBX   Observation/Result\n
    \             [{NTE}] Notes and Comments (for Results)\n         }\n       ]\n
    \ ]\n  {[CTI]}   Clinical Trial Identification\n [BLG]    Billing segment\n }\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\nA couple of interesting things to note before we work
    through an example.\n\n- As mentioned earlier, the ORM message can be used to
    send patient specific orders or just operational orders (like ordering sheets
    etc.) which is why, the PID segment above is an optional segment. The segment
    is only required in the case of new orders and only if the new order is related
    to a particular patient. Only then will / should  the PID segment be included
    in the message.\n- Note the presence of multiple (optional, repeatable) Diagnosis
    (DG1) segments. If repeated, the first will be the primary diagnosis.\n- Note
    the presence of the OBX (Observation) segment as an optional, repeatable segment.
    The use here is different from its use in the ORU (Observational Report - Unsolicited)
    message. When used, it carries clinical information that might be needed by the
    receiving system to interpret the observation that will be made, rather than information
    about observations and results. So if the consuming system is an Imaging system,
    then the ID would be set to TCM and and additional context around the order would
    be sent (for example, CPT code of order with the associated description- 73610^X-RAY
    ANKLE 3+ VW). Similarly, other ID types allowed include GDT (narrative), Addendum
    (ADT), Study Notes (TCM), Transcribed Reports (TX).\n\nWith that out of the way,
    let's take a simple message and see how it gets translated into an HL7 ORM message.\n\nThe
    message I want to send is: A male, African American patient, John Appleseed, MRN:20891312,
    SSN:123-45-7890 born on December 1, 1966 and account number of 11480003 needs
    to have X-Ray of his ankle done. The order is being place by Dr. James Matthews.
    The exact procedure to be performed is X-RAY ANKLE 3+ VW with the associated CPT
    code  of 73610. This is based upon a diagnosis of Broken Ankle. Additional information
    that will need to be sent will include facility, sending and receiving systems,
    the version of HL7 being used etc.\n\nBased on this information, the segments
    would be created as follows:\n\n#### MSH - Message Header\nAssuming an all Epic
    environment i.e. sending and receiving systems are all Epic and order is created
    at 2014/04/18 at 17:33:14. Version of HL7 being used is v2.3. This would result
    in a segment that looks like this.\n\n~~~shell\nMSH|^~\\&|EPIC|EPIC|||20140418173314|1148|ORM^O01|497|D|2.3||\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-shell}\n\n#### PID - Patient Identification\nSince this message
    is a patient specific order, it needs all the associated patient info to prevent
    any confusion and ensure no billing comebacks. This would include the patients
    identifier, full name, DOB, sex, race, address, phone number(s), account number,
    SSN and place of birth. Some of these are optional as described in the format
    specification.\n\n~~~shell\nPID|1||20891312^^^^EPI||APPLESEED^JOHN^A^^MR.^||19661201|M||AfrAm|505

    the NTE segment and go the next key one.\n\n#### PD1 - Patient Additional demographics\nThis
    essentially contains the name and ID of primary facility where care is being provided
    and the name and ID of the provider placing the order resulting in\n\n~~~shell\nPD1|||FACILITY(EAST)^^12345|1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-shell}\n\n#### PV1 - Patient Visit\nThis usually contains information
    on the admission information, attending, referring and consulting, admitting physician
    IDs and names and so on. I'll just keep it simple and just have the attending
    physician's info in the sample giving us\n\n~~~shell\nPV1|||^^^CARE HEALTH SYSTEMS^^^^^|||

    .prettyprint .lang-shell}\n\n#### ORC - Common Order\nFinally, we get to the order
    details. As mentioned before, since this is a patient specific order, it must
    be a new order.  So, we need to specify that it is a new order (NW), the order
    number of the originating (placer) system (987654 from EPIC), the order number
    of the system filling this (for reference - 76543 from EPIC). Additional details
    that need to be filled in include dates and times of transaction, who created
    the order, who the ordering provider was, the location IDs (facility, department)
    and callback information in case something needs to be clarified.\n\n~~~shell\nORC|NW|987654^EPIC|76543^EPC||Final||^^^20140418170014^^^^||20140418173314|1148^PATTERSON^JAMES^^^^||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^|1133^^^222^^^^^|(618)222-1122||\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-shell}\n\n#### Observation Request\nSince the order is being
    sent to an imaging facility, additional details need to be specified such as the
    CPT codes and so on. I won't detail this as much here. The key fields required
    here are the order details (73610^X-RAY ANKLE 3+ VW), ordering provider info (1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^)
    and who the interpreter of the results is going to be (6064^MANSFIELD^JEREMY^^^^).\n~~~\n{:

    .prettyprint .lang-shell}\n\n#### DG1:  - Diagnosis\nSome basic context needs
    to be provide so that the billing systems can do their work so diagnosis information
    is also provided. So in ICD10 (I10), ankle fracture is coded as S82.\n\n~~~shell\nDG1||I10|S82^ANKLE

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
