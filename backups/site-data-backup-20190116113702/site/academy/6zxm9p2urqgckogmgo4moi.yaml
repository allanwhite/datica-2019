  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Health—The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,
    among others. His expertise on compliance, HIPAA, and health IT is highly regarded
    and sought after. He recently released his first book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). "

  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: 'HIPAA attestation is everywhere but are they really compliant? Companies
  can self-attest to HIPAA compliance because there are no HIPAA certifications. '
:post: "> I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to
  my father. He said he wanted more proof. - Rodney Dangerfield\n\nAnybody can, and
  many companies do, put \"HIPAA Compliant\" on their websites and marketing material.
  Complying with HIPAA is essential to [selling software](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/whitepapers/making-enterprise-healthcare-sales-easier/)
  that processes, stores, transmits, or somehow touches [ePHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/).
  It's an essential, though non-differentiating, feature of any B2B healthcare technology
  product. The reason companies can self-attest to being HIPAA compliant is that there
  isn't a certifying body, or accompanying certification, for HIPAA. That's problematic
  for both _vendors_ making and selling healthcare software to enterprises and _enterprises_
  buying software from third party vendors. Let's talk briefly about those two camps.\n\n*
  **Vendors.** Compliance is a challenge because vendors constantly answer the same
  questions over and over again, though often phrased differently or in different
  formats (word docs vs spreadsheets). They often must provide different forms of
  evidence for each of these reviews. Not having evidence, or not having validated
  (externally audited) evidence, can slow the process and extend sales and implementation
  cycles.\n\n* **Enterprises.** Compliance is problematic for enterprises because
  they need to collect and review different forms of evidence and responses to questions
  from vendors. This takes time, does not typically leave security and compliance
  groups with lots of confidence since the evidence is so scattered and largely self-attested.
  Angst is often created between business buyers and compliance groups.\n\nThe end
  result is an inefficient process of security and compliance reviews where vendors
  and enterprises essentially reinvent the wheel for every new relationship. It's
  akin to how EHR integrations work today in that every new contract for a vendor
  or enterprise is like creating a new point-to-point relationship. Similarly, it
  can be a big stumbling block for vendors, especially smaller ones that have a hard
  time absorbing the cost of longer sales cycles.\n\n\n## HIPAA vs PCI\n\nThe financial
  industry, in contrast to healthcare, created a standardized certification for processing
  financial transactions or storing financial data. The [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2-0#pci_dss_v2-0)
  is a set of rules and requirements that can be tested, with passing resulting in
  certification to process financial transactions. Financial organizations and vendors
  work with a [qualified security assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php)
  in order to be certified. As opposed to HIPAA, organizations cannot self-attest
  to being \"PCI Compliant.\"\n\nThe reason for the differences between the financial
  industry (PCI) and the healthcare industry (HIPAA) is that PCI was created and is
  maintained by the private sector. If you look at who governs PCI, it's almost all
  the [large financial institutions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/organization_info/executive-committee.php).
  Essentially PCI is self-governing. HIPAA, in contrast, was created and is maintained
  by Health and Human Services (HHS), a government agency responsible for many different
  areas of healthcare. HIPAA is [interpreted and enforced](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/whos-really-interpreting-and-enforcing-hipaa-for-startups/)
  by non-government organizations and not HHS.\n\nChange is coming in healthcare that
  will make HIPAA more like PCI. The changes are represented in the new compliance
  framework and certification called [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).\n\nHITRUST,
  like PCI, is [governed by a board made up of large private sector healthcare organizations](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/)
  like Anthem and United Healthcare. HITRUST maintains the [Common Security Framework
  (CSF)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/), which is
  essentially a PCI DSS for healthcare and HIPAA. Similarly to PCI, HITRUST CSF Certifications
  are granted to organizations that complete the CSF, have the results validated by
  an [approved third party assessor](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/),
  and then are verified by HITRUST itself. The resulting form of evidence is a certification
  and standard report. Datica has been through the HITRUST process and is awaiting
  final verification from HITRUST.\n\n\n## How to Prove HIPAA Compliance\n\nDifferent
  paths can lead to HIPAA compliance. To be clear, we're talking about proving compliance
  with HIPAA as part of an enterprise (payer and provider system) deployment. We've
  outlined a couple of options below. We have personal experience with each path,
  and have Datica customers that fit into each, so we feel confident discussing the
  pros and cons of each.\n\n\n### Path 1 - Self Assessments\n\nThe first option does
  not require third party verification or auditing. Not shockingly, self assessments
  are the easiest and least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show
  compliance with HIPAA.\n\nDownsides proliferate, however. The inspiration that led
  to the formation of Datica was based on our experience trying to sell modern, cloud
  based software as part of a previous venture; it's also important to note this was
  just before the new HIPAA Omnibus Rules went into effect in late 2013. We were selling
  to large healthcare enterprises (mostly academic - UCSF, University of Colorado,
  etc) and trying to prove compliance with HIPAA based on our own assessment. We were
  spending the majority of our time configuring our technology and updating our policies
  and internal procedures in order to deploy our technology and complete sales. All
  that time, effort, and work was going into things that our users would never see
  or appreciate. It's the reason we built Datica and the reason we [open sourced our
  policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).\n\n\n#### Supporting
  Documentation\n\nWithout official audit reports you must illustrate your compliance
  story through hand-crafted documentation. You can simply respond to compliance questionnaires
  with specific technical settings, but you may also have to provide some form of
  proof (like screenshots of settings or links to policies).\n\nA better approach
  is to use some type of framework to pre-compile answers to questions around HIPAA.
  The best framework to use is the [Audit Program Protocol](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/protocol.html)
  from OCR (part of HHS). Companies complete this framework to at minimum identify
  existing gaps before talking to compliance officers. Another option is to complete
  the [Common Security Framework (CSF)](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/)
  from HITRUST. This is more involved and takes more time than the OCR framework but
  provides a standardized report (not a spreadsheet you created yourself for the OCR
  framework). Self-assessing with HITRUST also has a cost, whereas the OCR framework
  is free.\n\nBe prepared to answer many questions. You will need both technology
  settings and policies to prove compliance. You need to assure technology (things
  like backup and DR) and internal procedures (things like training) are in line.\n\nWe've
  been through [multiple third party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
  at Datica. Based on that experience, we discovered transparency and proactive approaches
  to HIPAA have value for everyone. We decided to publish our [policies](https://policy.datica.com/)
  and our [mappings to HIPAA](https://hipaa.datica.com/). The HIPAA page is very close
  to a web page representation of the OCR audit framework linked above. If you're
  interested in leveraging our design for these pages, please [let us know](mailto:hello@datica.com)
  and we'll be happy to provide you with the code to host it yourself. Also, both
  our policy page and HIPAA page are dynamically generated by Github repos, which
  serve as the master source and provide a great form of version control (good for
  an audit). Our policies are written in Markdown for simplicity.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
  Less upfront time and effort\n* Lower cost\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* Can derail (or drastically
  slow) sales process\n* A lot more effort during the sales process (it will require
  a lot more time learning about HIPAA to respond to questions)\n\n\n### Path 2 -
  Full third party audits\n\nAudits are not fun. Audits are not cheap. \n\nIn a previous
  life, Datica's CEO, [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), conducted technology
  assessments for HIPAA audits in addition to Datica completing three external audits.
  We feel we have a good understanding of the process and value. Despite the effort
  and cost, audits are the single best way to streamline the security and compliance
  portion of the sales process.\n\nWe fully realize audits aren't an option for many
  smaller organizations. We are often asked \"when should I do an audit?\" and \"do
  I have to do an audit to close a deal?\" The answer to the latter question is an
  emphatic _No_, you don't have to do an audit to close a deal with a healthcare enterprise.
  The answer to the former is harder to answer. Of current non-enterprise Datica customers,
  less than 5% have done external audits (we think this is fantastic, actually).\n\nVendors
  typically do audits once they have about 4-5 enterprises customers. At this point
  companies shift to scaling sales based on lessons learned from early reference customers.
  It may have taken 12-24 months to acquire the initial 4-5 customers; acquiring the
  next 8-10 customers must be faster. Scaling sales means adding more sales agents,
  many of which won't have the same experience selling and answering questions about
  security and compliance; in this context, audit reports are empowering to sales
  people. Also, organizations with 4-5 customers typically have more resources. All
  those factors seem to push vendors over the tipping point of doing an external audit.
  The audit is a tool to help vendors accelerate and scale sales efforts. Maybe the
  best way to answer the question around when to do an audit is to say that doing
  an audit makes sense when security and compliance is the main bottleneck for sales.\n\n\n####
  Supporting Documentation\n\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each
  customer about security and compliance, providing your audit reports will go a long
  way to circumventing long, drawn out security and compliance reviews. On many occasions,
  you may only get asked about gaps that exist in your audit reports. Oftentimes those
  gaps will have associated remediation plans and you may get asked if gaps have been
  remediated. In essence, you've proven compliance to third party auditors so there's
  a lower burden of proof for your customers.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* Speeds up sales process\n*
  Puts less of a burden on internal resources (sales and tech) to be well versed in
  HIPAA\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* It's expensive and time consuming\n* They do become out of
  date so need to assure you revisit, likely annually\n\n\n#### Types of audits\n\nBroadly
  speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be audited
  against:\n\n1. HIPAA (from HHS)\n2. HITRUST\n\nWe've done both at Datica. We started
  with HIPAA, as our auditors recommended, and then moved on to HITRUST. We began
  with a HIPAA gap assessment, which most auditing firms will recommend if it's your
  first audit. Basically a gap assessment is lighter weight in terms of verifying
  things and is meant to, as the name implies, identify gaps in your compliance and
  security programs when mapping those programs to HIPAA rules. Once you know the
  gaps you can address them, or mitigate them if they can't be addressed for some
  reason. From there, a full HIPAA audit is a lot easier and holds a much higher chance
  of success.\n\nOnce we'd completed our gap assessment, addressed our gaps, and then
  completed our HIPAA audit, we did our HITRUST audit. The official term for that
  a Validated HITRUST Assessment. We opted to complete the HITRUST assessment because:\n\n1.
  More enterprises were asking about it\n2. A strong security and compliance program
  and culture at Datica is important\n3. It is a valuable tool for our customers in
  their sales process\n\nAs opposed to HIPAA audits, which are somewhat customized
  by each auditing firm, HITRUST has created one framework (the CSF linked above)
  that all entities are assessed against. It doesn't matter if you're small or large,
  the framework is the same. Some variability exists around the scope of a HITRUST
  audit as there are certain aspects of security and compliance that apply to some
  organizations and not others. HITRUST also has the concept of risk levels which
  determine the extent of questions organizations need to answer and prove. The bank
  of questions and resulting report are standardized. It is a true certification,
  as opposed to HIPAA.\n\nFor us, the HITRUST assessment involved two site visits
  and completing 278 different question areas. Each question area required attestation
  of 5 different maturity levels and each maturity level required some form of justification
  and/or proof. Also, many questions required additional comments to add context and
  specificity for how the question area fit with Datica. Taking out the comments and
  back and forth as HITRUST and our auditors reviewed our responses, that's just under
  7,000 responses. Completing the 7,000 HITRUST entries was made more painful by the
  incredibly slow (think spinning pinwheel) response times in the CSF web app.\n\nOther
  certification-type frameworks exist, like the [DIRECT certification](http://www.directtrust.org/becoming-accredited/)
  and Meaningful Use. These can be used as a proxy for an audit, as they do assess
  certain aspects of security and compliance programs, but these don't hold as much
  weight as HIPAA or HITRUST audits.\n\n#### Cost of an audit\n\nCost is a common
  question. This is too broad a topic to completely cover here because the [real cost
  of audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) involves more than the direct
  cost. For example, try to estimate the cost of completing 7,000 entries in a slow
  web app for a sense of the indirect costs.\n\nMost want to know the direct costs,
  which is easier to compute. From our experience, and those of customers and contacts
  at other modern tech vendors, the average cost of audits is about $20,000 for a
  HIPAA gap assessment, $20,000-$25,000 for a full HIPAA audit, and $30,000-$35,000
  for a Validated HITRUST Assessment (includes both auditor's fees the the licensing
  fee to HITRUST). Variability exists from audit firm to audit firm but these prices
  are consistently what we hear.\n\n\n### Path 3 - Middle Road: Inheriting Proof\n\nIf
  you've gotten this far, chances are neither Path 1 or 2 above appeal to you. Path
  1 is easy but can kill sales. Path 2 is expensive, extremely time consuming, and
  you might run out of money before you start selling. We've been in your shoes. When
  we sat down as a team and decided to build Datica, pivoting out of our previous
  venture, neither Path 1 or 2 seemed terribly appealing to us.\n\nDatica was built
  to create Path 3. There had to be an easier way to build modern healthcare technology,
  practice modern development practices, comply with HIPAA without having to hire
  a compliance expert, and to prove compliance with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nAs
  technology has evolved and computing has become distributed, driven largely by easy-to-use
  cloud platforms and APIs, different requirements of HIPAA are getting distributed
  across partner organizations. It's why HHS expanded who is covered under HIPAA to
  include [subcontractors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-subcontractors-and-baas/).
  Covered entities work with business associates who in turn work with one to many
  subcontractors. In this brave new world, certain requirements under HIPAA are inherited
  by business associates from their subcontractors.\n\nThe industry has proven our
  early assumptions. Many customers utilize our audit reports, policy page, and HIPAA
  mappings as the cornerstone of their compliance programs. These resources, collectively
  what we refer to as a **HIPAA Sales Package**, are a core part of the value that
  we provide to our customers. We've spent 1,000s of hours on security and compliance
  (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training, etc) and $10,000s on audits
  so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our customers inherit our work
  and our expertise, making compliance and trust a core part of their products. In
  fact, several of our customers have told us they've delayed audits because they
  leverage Datica.\n\nWhen our customers do decide to go down the path of doing a
  full audit, we help them in the process and make it less time consuming for them.
  Since we've been through multiple HIPAA and HITRUST audits, our customers give their
  auditors our documentation and audit reports to show evidence of certain aspects
  of HIPAA. \n\nHow is Path 3 different from Path 1 and other compliant cloud options?
  If you've built and configured your own technology on a traditional hosting vendor
  like AWS, you're going to have to prove every aspect of HIPAA compliance. You can
  point to the hosting vendors SOC2 (other audit reports) and BAA, but those only
  a address a small subset of the HIPAA rules like physical security. All other aspects
  of HIPAA, from a technical perspective, is yours to prove. The same goes for the
  admin side of HIPAA, though this is typically less important to security and compliance
  groups that the technical rules. With Path 3, we offer a fully audited platform
  and address more of HIPAA than any other option.\n\n\n## Choices, choices, choices\n\nIn
  the end, the path you choose to prove HIPAA is up to you and will be driven by your
  available resources, both financial and human. We've focused here more on the technical
  requirements of HIPAA, but the administrative side is also relevant. Completely
  addressing both the technical and administrative side of is necessary to proving
  compliance with HIPAA.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how we can
  help with the technical aspects of HIPAA, don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com).
  If you have specific questions about any of this, please let us know and we'd be
  happy to respond."

  :summary: 'HIPAA encryption strategy is another factor of HIPAA compliance, whether
    HIPAA SSL, data at rest, Filevault2, firewall encryption, or more.   '
  :post: |
    Encryption is one of the standards that exist within the HIPAA Security Rule (164.312(a)(2)(iv)). Specifically, encryption is used as a means of access control. HIPAA defines encryption as "the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key". HIPAA goes to say “Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information."

    When we talk about encryption in HIPAA, it means both encryption in transit, or data moving from point A (app) to point B (server/DB), and as encryption at rest, or on the hard drive. Encryption is straightforward. It's become industry practice not just in healthcare, but generally - with web services and even increasingly websites - to use SSL and encryption during transmission. With HIPAA, it's important that you do end-to-end encryption - from app to firewall to app server to database server, or logging server even. That means every step along the way from origination to delivery.

    The level of encryption that you use in transit is something that should be industry best practice. We use 256-bit SSL encryption in transit. We have talked to some large corporate entities that have systems that store massive amounts of ePHI behind firewalls in secure networks and the encryption that they're using is just 56-bit on some of these systems. If you talk to them, they feel that the risk is mitigated because of the environment and the access controls that are round those systems and networks.

    The other aspect of encryption is encryption at rest. If you store data in some type of database, encrypting that hard disk is important. When we started out with Datica, we encrypted all of our hard drives. What we discovered was that we took a pretty big hit on I/O performance doing that with standard drives. We swapped out all of our drives for high performing SSD drives and that improved our performance considerably. Today, we encrypt all of our database drives using AES 256-bit encryption, and the SSD drives make the performance comparable to unencrypted volumes.

    There are other encryption tools you can use to improve performance in an encrypted environment. The newer Intel i5 and i7 chips can do AES-NI, which speeds up encryption considerably. AES-NI is what the makes the performance in FileVault2 encryption on new Macs so much better than the performance in previous versions. As part of our HIPAA workstation security policy, we require FileVault encryption on all company laptops. We also encrypt internal company passwords, SSH keys, and secure notes using Lastpass and 256-bit encryption. Decrypting Lastpass requires two-factor authentication through Duo Security.

    Encryption strategy is something you need to think about. This means more than just encrypting, it means how you are going to securely manage keys and maintain performance of your technology. We're happy to talk to you more about how we take care of all aspects of encryption, from in-transit and at-rest to key management and performance, for our customers.

  :summary: 'Learn about HIPAA enforcement, including who is responsible for enforcing
    HIPAA violations and compliance, and the fines for violating HIPAA. '
  :lead: When people talk or write about HIPAA, it's always presumed that there's
    an enforcement aspect, though enforcement is rarely explicitly discussed.
  :post: |
    As much as people and organizations value the privacy and security of the personal health information of their customers (patients, members, users/consumers), the fear of HIPAA violation fines and other penalties are the major drivers of compliance and security efforts. Penalties, whether fines or otherwise, are quantifiable and expose organizations to very real financial risk if proper controls, both tech and policy, aren't put into place and followed.

    HHS sets the rules for HIPAA, and enforcement is carried out by The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS. OCR is tasked with the responsibility of investigating complaints. Based on an investigation, the OCR determines if the covered entity or the business associate of a covered entity was in compliance with the HIPAA security and privacy rule. The investigation branches at whether an organization is in violation of HIPAA rules or not. If the organization is not in violation, the findings are documented and the case is closed. HIPAA is not always prescriptive, and has terms like "reasonable," so there is some interpretation and gray area at this stage.

    In a recent report by the OCR, the HIPAA Security Rule accounted for the majority, or 60%, of violations, followed by HIPAA Privacy Rule violations and then HIPAA Breach Notification violations. That recent report also cited a lack of complete or accurate risk assessments as a widespread problem, with up to two thirds of entities lacking full and timely risk assessments. Risk assessments are incredibly valuable and should inform much of your security and privacy posture as an organization.

    If the OCR finds an organization to be in violation, the following actions may take place:

    * Voluntary compliance;
    * Corrective action; and/or
    * Resolution agreement.

    There are monetary penalties associated with HIPAA violations, and the amounts of such violations were raised considerably last year as part of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule included in the HITECH act. The current financial penalties are listed below.

    (image: penalties.png)

    Previous to these new rules, the fine associated with each HIPAA violation was capped at $25,000. This number is now $1.5 million per violation.

    In certain extreme HIPAA cases, individuals can be exposed to criminal risk as well. When criminal action is involved with HIPAA, the OCR hands the case off to The Department of Justice. Individuals are at risk of HIPAA enforcement and penalties if they "knowingly" obtain, disclose, or use PHI "in violation" of HIPAA rules. You can read a very detailed, legal opinion on what [constitutes](http://www.justice.gov/olc/hipaa_final.htm) legal vs civil in the case of HIPAA. There is a lengthy discussion of the terms "knowingly" and "in violation" in that document, which is why we put them in quotes.

    It's not always clear who enforces HIPAA compliance and violations. The HIPAA privacy rule is enforced by the OCR, the Department of Justice to a lesser extent, and, recently, the FCC has waded into HIPAA enforcement for the privacy of health data through its mandate to protect consumers. The financial penalties from the FCC are lower than those from the OCR; but, the FCC has the power to require annual privacy audits, as it has done with companies like Google and Facebook, and these audits, over time, have the potential to be very expensive for companies. This move by the FCC is new, and still making its way through the courts, so it's still uncertain how the FCC will fit with HIPAA enforcement.

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :summary: HITRUST is a superset security framework and understanding both the advantages
    and disadvantages of this will help you wield HITRUST successfully.
  :blog_lead: One big reason HITRUST is taken so seriously is how it is composed of
    a long list of other security and risk management frameworks. HITRUST is a superset
    security framework and understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of
    this point goes a long way in understanding how to wield HITRUST successfully.
  :post: "The HITRUST Alliance purposefully took the best parts of past frameworks
    to mold its \"Common Security Framework\" or CSF. The [HITRUST CSF](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    is then a list of more than seven hundred controls with the best parts of PCI,
    NIST, and more in mind. Let's walk through the composite list.\n\n## The HITRUST
    list\n\nIn HITRUST's official introduction, it lists out the sources of influence:\n\n*
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Principles
    and Criteria\n* Catalog of Minimum Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-E)
    – Exchange Reference Architecture (ERA) Supplement v2\n* Center for Internet Security
    (CIS) Critical Security Controls v6\n* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) Omnibus Final Rule\n* IRS Publication 1075, Tax Information Security
    Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies: Safeguards for Protecting Federal
    Tax Returns and Return Information (New)\n* ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Information Technology—Security
    Techniques—Information Security Management Systems Requirements\n* ISO/IEC 27002:2013,
    Information Technology—Security Techniques—Code of Practice for Information Security
    Controls\n* ISO/IEC 27799:2008 Health Informatics (guidance for information security
    management for healthcare organizations using ISO/IEC 27002:2005)\n* National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)\n*
    NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity v1\n* Control
    Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT) v4.1\n* Payment Card
    Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard v3.2\n* Federal privacy requirements (e.g.,
    HHS)\n* State security requirements (e.g., Nevada, Massachusetts, and Texas)\n*
    Experiences and best practices of HITRUST participants\n\n## The positives and
    negatives of HITRUST CSF certification\n\nThere are positives and negatives to
    thinking about [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) as a superset framework.\n\nFirst,
    the main negative: If you become HITRUST CSF Certified, you are **not** certified
    or compliant with the above list. If you want to be SOC2 certified or PCI compliant,
    you must still conduct those assessments independently with your auditor. If your
    business is such where it's mandatory you provide those defined assurances, it
    means you have other audits to manage and pay for. That can be frustrating.\n\nBut
    there are many positives to HITRUST's superset nature. The biggest is the credibility
    and thoroughness attributed to a certification. Most compliance and security officers
    at covered entities are adopting HITRUST as the best and only required way to
    assess business associates because they know if someone is HITRUST CSF Certified,
    they have gone through a thorough process to prove assurances.\n\nThe other positive
    is the overall reduction in cost for your company to prove security and compliance.
    Again, within the framing that it's not necessarily a hard requirement to show
    PCI compliance, et al, your organization can effectively demonstrate credibility
    within those 14 frameworks in a one-time shot. We've written a case study about
    [our own HITRUST certification costs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/),
    which average somewhere around $20,000-$60,000 depending on scope.\n\nIf you are
    working on a project which requires compliance and are looking into HITRUST, consider
    us a resource. We'd be happy to chat more about the benefits of HITRUST on the
    cloud. \n\n"

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
