  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: HIPAA Security Rule standards include training workforce members. That means
  all employees and contractors of a business associate or covered entity.
:post: |-
  There are standards within the HIPAA Security Rule to train all organization workforce members. That means all employees, as well as contractors, of a business associate  or covered entity. The rules for training two-fold - 1) providing training to new workforce members and 2) ongoing and periodic training, especially with environment or organizational changes. It's not simply a one time and done requirement.

  The content of training should also be two-fold - 1) training around HIPAA (what is PHI, when is it authorized to disclose, etc) and 2) training around information security. The first category of content deals with understanding what HIPAA is, the types of data that would meet the definition of ePHI, and the types of safeguards which are required and addressable as part of HIPAA - things like encryption, auditing, and disaster recovery. The goal should be for every employee and contractor to have an understanding of what HIPAA means, at a high level, and ideally have it be a part of the way that an organization makes operational and technical decisions.

  The other category of training relates not specifically to HIPAA, but more around training workforce members in information security best practices. It's important to understand about things like encryption from the technical perspective and from a process perspective, not necessarily for HIPAA, but so that good information security practices are something that workforce members know and follow.

  At Datica, we provide HIPAA and information security training for all new employees to assure that they know how to spell HIPAA correctly, and additionally, so that they understand the nature of the types of data that we're storing for customers, the importance of the integrity of that data, and the security and privacy related to that data. We also provide employees training on an annual basis and with weekly, what we call, Brown Bag Trainings. Those trainings always relate to either a HIPAA topic, like contingency planning or disaster recovery, or a security topic, like some specific information security topic that may not be prescriptive within HIPAA, but is really best practice. The reason we differentiate between the two categories of training is that compliance and security aren't always the same thing.

  We want security to be a part of the way that our workforce members think about technology. We want it to go into every decision that they make, and every requirement that they write, and every line of code. So that they understand not just the importance of HIPAA, not just what is PHI, but also what are the best technical practices to secure that data. We're acting as a trusted compliance partner, and an abstracted compliance and security layer for our customers, so we need security and compliance to be at the center of how we operate. We put a lot of time and energy into training to make sure that all of the technology that we provide to our customers is not just compliant, but also secure. We're planning to "open source" our training, and do more open training by using our Brown Bag Trainings as a springboard into blog posts in which others can learn.

  :summary: If you're going through a HIPAA security audit by a hospital or payer
    compliance office, auditing and logging will show that your application is secure.
  :post: |
    Auditing and logging are an important part of the HIPAA Security Rule, but there not prescriptive controls defined. According to HIPAA Security Rule - 164.312(b):

    > Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

    HIPAA goes on to say, in slightly more specific terms, that covered entities and business associates implement:

    > Procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies.

    Put simply, what HIPAA boils down to is that all access, both success and failures, to electronic protected health information (ePHI) should be monitored and logged and be accessible in the case of a breach. You should be able to go back to your HIPAA log and investigate what data was accessed, conduct forensics to try to figure out how that data was accessed in an unauthorized way and who may have been the person or entity that accessed it, and determine if/how data was altered. It's the who, what, when, and how of access that needs to be audited and logged.

    Auditing is so important because the integrity and availability of data is crucial in healthcare and in HIPAA. When ePHI data changes, is deleted, or is accessed in some unauthorized way, that represents a breach to HIPAA and is something that needs to be tracked both proactivel – using alerting and monitoring – as well as reactively, or retroactively, to investigate when an unauthorized breach might have taken place.

    The types of logs should include system and network logs. This is basically what goes into syslog on a *nix box and, ideally, the server has detailed logging turned on. Next, any application access and database access should be logged. The metadata (when, what, where, etc) associated with log data is extremely valuable.

    If you log enough data, you can proactively identify when a breach may have occurred with intelligent alerting. Once logging is properly configured, alerts are relatively easy to add. You can go back and investigate and dive deeper into what that the breach might be and ideally not just say "we store 100,000 patient records and our database was breached, so 100,000 patient records were disclosed improperly." With good logging, you should be able to point to the one, individual record that was breached and additionally maybe even the one specific piece of the record was breached (and how it might have or might not have been altered). That's some of the power of good logging.

    The approach that we take at Datica is to log every interaction with our systems - all API traffic - application logs, database logs, and system logs. For companies that use us as Datica Compliant Cloud, we give them one endpoint so that whatever application logs they are generating, we can store those for them; we'll also help them determine what data they should be capturing in application logs. We store the application logs, along with system logs that we generate, in an encrypted, dedicated store for each customer, and we provide customers with views and API access into that data.

    It's a very powerful unified logging service, one that's HIPAA grade and meant for ePHI. The service sits within our environment right next to your application and we combine your log data that we're already collecting on the servers and network traffic. We pull all that in into one place and give you a managed console for logging. Soon we'll be enabling customers to set alerts as well. If you're going through a HIPAA audit or assessment by a compliance office at a hospital or payer, this is a very powerful tool to assure them of the security and integrity of your application.

  :summary: 'HIPAA encryption strategy is another factor of HIPAA compliance, whether
    HIPAA SSL, data at rest, Filevault2, firewall encryption, or more.   '
  :post: |
    Encryption is one of the standards that exist within the HIPAA Security Rule (164.312(a)(2)(iv)). Specifically, encryption is used as a means of access control. HIPAA defines encryption as "the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key". HIPAA goes to say “Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information."

    When we talk about encryption in HIPAA, it means both encryption in transit, or data moving from point A (app) to point B (server/DB), and as encryption at rest, or on the hard drive. Encryption is straightforward. It's become industry practice not just in healthcare, but generally - with web services and even increasingly websites - to use SSL and encryption during transmission. With HIPAA, it's important that you do end-to-end encryption - from app to firewall to app server to database server, or logging server even. That means every step along the way from origination to delivery.

    The level of encryption that you use in transit is something that should be industry best practice. We use 256-bit SSL encryption in transit. We have talked to some large corporate entities that have systems that store massive amounts of ePHI behind firewalls in secure networks and the encryption that they're using is just 56-bit on some of these systems. If you talk to them, they feel that the risk is mitigated because of the environment and the access controls that are round those systems and networks.

    The other aspect of encryption is encryption at rest. If you store data in some type of database, encrypting that hard disk is important. When we started out with Datica, we encrypted all of our hard drives. What we discovered was that we took a pretty big hit on I/O performance doing that with standard drives. We swapped out all of our drives for high performing SSD drives and that improved our performance considerably. Today, we encrypt all of our database drives using AES 256-bit encryption, and the SSD drives make the performance comparable to unencrypted volumes.

    There are other encryption tools you can use to improve performance in an encrypted environment. The newer Intel i5 and i7 chips can do AES-NI, which speeds up encryption considerably. AES-NI is what the makes the performance in FileVault2 encryption on new Macs so much better than the performance in previous versions. As part of our HIPAA workstation security policy, we require FileVault encryption on all company laptops. We also encrypt internal company passwords, SSH keys, and secure notes using Lastpass and 256-bit encryption. Decrypting Lastpass requires two-factor authentication through Duo Security.

    Encryption strategy is something you need to think about. This means more than just encrypting, it means how you are going to securely manage keys and maintain performance of your technology. We're happy to talk to you more about how we take care of all aspects of encryption, from in-transit and at-rest to key management and performance, for our customers.

  :summary: A risk assessment – a HIPAA requirement – is the first thing to do since
    it frames many decisions you'll make regarding your security posture.
  :post: |
    Probably the first thing to consider when going down the path of compliance, or really the first thing to think about regarding security holistically, is to perform a risk assessment. A risk assessment is a requirement of HIPAA and it's really the first thing that should be done. The reason it's so important is because it frames many of the rest of the decisions you make regarding your security posture.

    In the words of HHS - "Conducting a risk analysis is the first step in identifying and implementing safeguards that comply with and carry out the standards and implementation specifications in the Security Rule. Therefore, a risk analysis is foundational..."

    From the HIPAA Security Rule - "Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the organization."

    As part of the risk assessment you need to outline your core technology infrastructure. In that process you should do an inventory of all the systems that you manage. Then you need to map out which of those systems process, transmit, or store electronic protected health information (ePHI). For us that's the starting point for risk management strategy and a risk assessment.

    The next step in a thorough risk assessment is to assess the various threats and vulnerabilities to your environment, and ultimately to the integrity of ePHI. These can be anything from physical threats, like breaking into a data center or a fire or natural disaster in your data center, to malicious software, like hacking into a system, to internal malfeasance, like an employee going rogue and breaking into your systems. You need to map out all of the possible threats and vulnerabilities.

    For us, we map vulnerabilities specifically to HIPAA rules related to protection of ePHI. For each perceived vulnerability, we assess the likelihood and impact - with the product of those two factors producing the risk level. The impact is the potential of a risk leading to a PHI breach - or a loss of PHI - because there are issues around integrity of data in HIPAA. We also determine if that risk has been mitigated in some way by our current security posture and controls.

    Once you know the infrastructure, risks, and threats/vulnerabilities, the next step is to mitigate the risks that exist and have not been fully mitigated by current security controls. Not all risks can be 100% mitigated. There are typically gaps in almost all risk assessments because if you do a risk assessment you will get a ton of different variables - not just the obvious ones at the top of your head right now. And, from those risks, there typically are some gaps that need to be mitigated. It's imperative that you come up with a mitigation strategy. Ask yourself what you can do that is reasonable and appropriate to mitigate risks to ePHI. From there, you need to implement those mitigation strategies and documenting thoroughly. Documentation is not fun but has to be done in a compliant industry like healthcare.

    We follow all of the steps above using a spreadsheet with sheets for each step, and we do ours both annually and on an ongoing basis, when there are changes to our core infrastructure. We use NIST standards ([NIST800-30](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf) and [800-26](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/Draft-sp800-26Rev1.pdf)) as the model for our [risk assessment](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#security-management-process---164.308(a)(1)(i)) at Datica. We're more than happy to share the spreadsheets and the steps and processes that we use to do that. If you want to reach out to us we can help you with that process. But that really is the first step that you need to do because that helps you really understand where your major gaps are. And it also helps you understand which things you need to do to implement or mitigate the risk that you have within, and the threats that you have to your infrastructure and to PHI -  that you're storing a processing or whatever it might be for covered entity.

  :summary: The acronym PHI stands for Protected Health Information. An individual's
    PHI is data on health status, provision of health care, or payment for health.
  :post: |-
    **The acronym**: PHI stands for **P**rotected **H**ealth **I**nformation - not personal health information (although that's in essense what it implies), not personally identifiable health information (I've seen it used although that would technically be PIHI) and I'm sure there are variants of this that you've heard as well.


    **The definition**: Here's the wikipedia [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information). Protected health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual. HHS provides an even simpler  of PHI - individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a Covered Entity or its Business Associate; the definition of a "business associate" has been extended with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. This term "information" is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient's medical record or payment history. The key here is this phrase "that can be linked to a specific individual". Which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information) - here's the [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) to the wikipedia article on that - becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal definition - i.e. PII is anything that **could** be used to uniquely identify an individual. PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person - especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.

    ## Protection

    The core of the HIPAA regulations is to ensure that ownership of any and all medical data is retained solely by the individual. The individual can then decide to parcel out access to others - providers, family members, employers if needed or necessary or simply by preference of the record owner. Only an individual has the right to grant access to their medical data. This was mainly done for the following reasons:

    1. **Privacy**: Obviously we would prefer that our neighbor (or in some cases, family members) not know about whatever condition we might be suffering from or medication we are taking.

    2. **Bias and discrimination**: AIDS, mental health and other conditions have some (albeit declining) social stigma associated with it. The HIPAA PHI provisions ensure that employers and others do not have access to one's medical record and use the information contained within to discriminate against the individual based on their health information.

    ## Uniqueness

    Obviously protection and privacy come into play once the individual can / has been uniquely identified. [There are after all 25.8 million Americans have diabetes](http://ndep.nih.gov/diabetes-facts/). Which leads to the question of what data can be used to uniquely identify an individual. The generally accepted set of individually unique data elements include the following:

    |#|Identifier|Description|
    |-|----------|-----------|
    |1|Name|Well, of course i.e. first name, last name, maiden name combinations. One could argue that just any **one** of the above doesn't uniquely identify an individual after all "James" is a pretty common name. But it could be possible to identify an individual using a combination of data i.e. first name, zipcode, street address etc.|
    |2|Geographic locators|Everything (street address, city, precinct, zipcode, lat long coordinates etc.) are considered PII. The first three digits of the zipcode are usually considered ok for use except in the case of certain zipcodes which cover a small population (less than 20,000). There are currently 17 zipcodes that fit that profile - 036, 692, 878, 059, 790, 879, 063, 821, 884, 102, 823, 890, 203, 830, 893, 556, 831. So three digit zipcodes are ok to be used except for the above listed ones.|
    |3|Dates|Pertaining to significant events in an individual's life - birth, death, marriage, admission, discharge etc. Just the year is generally considered fine for use except in the case of the very elderly (>89 years of age; in which case they would be represented by an aggregate category, e.g. <90)|
    |4|Phone numbers|Well, of course.|
    |5|Fax numbers|This is, IMHO, a carryover from the old days. Do you know a lot of people with a personal fax number? But, it does make sense.|
    |6|Electronic mail addresses (email)|Check|
    |7|Social Security numbers|Check|
    |8|Medical record numbers|This is usually a "random" number and could be used if one also knew the institution that assigned it.|
    |9|Health plan beneficiary numbers|This is your insurance card / member ID.|
    |10|Account numbers|Bank numbers etc.|
    |11|Certificate/license numbers|Drivers license, birth certificate number etc.|
    |12|Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers|If it's good enough for the police to track someone down...|
    |13|Device identifiers and serial numbers|Medical devices have unique serial numbers. Your computer's MAC id is unique as well.|
    |14|Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)|This is a bit murky but is in here to cover all possibilities. http://www.facebook.com isn't very unique. But if logged within a specific application, could indeed be very unique to an individual.|
    |15|Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers|Your IP address can be used to easily identify your address. There are several free services that offer this (do a quick google search for [address from ip](https://www.google.com/search?q=address+from+ip&oq=address_) and try this as an [example](http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm)|
    |16|Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints|Don't forget retinal images.|
    |17|Full face photographic images and any comparable images|Check|
    |18|Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code|Re code - note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the system to code the data.|

    These 18 elements are the core set of data elements that individually or in combination can be used to uniquely identify an individual. And, considering the fact that the above list of identifiers has **fax numbers** and not Twitter @usernames, Facebook IDs, or a host of other modern, more common identifiers, it's clear that the PII list is not the most up to date and some more thought should go into recognizing and protecting identifiable information. However, since patient data is valuable in clinical trials, medical case studies etc., the above list is used as a guideline to ensure privacy. Which leads to...

    ## Anonymization & De-identification

    **Anonymization** is a process by which PHI elements are removed or changed with the purpose of minimizing / removing the possibility of going back to the original data set. This involves removing all identifying data to create unlinkable data.

    **De-identification** under HIPAA occurs when data has been stripped of common identifiers by two methods:

    1. Remove the 18 elements listed above;

    2. If another approach is used, ensure a statistically small / negligible risk of re-identification which is validated by a statistics expert (you have to love the interpretability of that rule).

    ## Designing HIPAA compliant solutions

    Given the above constraints, it is essential that any application that you design takes these anonymization and/or de-identification requirements into account before any data is shared with any external entity. PHI data can be "shared" with an external entity provided you have BAA ([business associate agreement](http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/hipaaglos.htm#g7)) in place and the individual has signed the appropriate consent documents. How PHI needs to be managed under HIPAA is a whole topic in itself. Look for a blog post from us shortly describing how we enable HIPAA compliance and simplify adherence to the letter and spirit of the law at [Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).

  :summary: What is the definition of a security incident and data breach under HIPAA
    and GDPR and how do they compare? This article breaks down the key terminology.
  :lead: We get asked all the time for the meaning of a data breach. It often comes
    up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident. It gets even muddier
    when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought into the mix. While
    seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between these terms is essential
    to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers. Ambiguity and opacity
    is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and foundational definitions.
  :post: "\n## What is a security incident?\n\nStarting with a security incident,
    which is less ambiguous, [NIST defines the term in 800-61](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)
    as:\n\n> A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation
    of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.”\n\nHIPAA
    has a very similar definition in section 164.304:\n \n> \"A security incident
    as the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification,
    or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information
    system.”\n\nGDPR doesn’t explicitly define “security incident” so a safe path
    is to use the NIST definition if you want to comply with GDPR. GDPR does expand
    the definition of a “personal data breach,” as you’ll see below, so the distinction
    between security incident and data breach is less evident under GDPR than under
    HIPAA.\n\n## What is a HIPAA Data Breach?\n\nThe significant difference between
    a security incident and a data breach, or personal data breach, is the impact
    on individual data.\n\nHHS and HIPAA define a breach simply as:\n\n> A breach
    is, generally, an impermissible use or disclosure under the Privacy Rule that
    compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information.”\n \nAt
    Datica, we’ve used the [HIPAA definition for a data breach](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    But GDPR expands on that definition to include not just “impermissible use and
    disclosure” but “destruction, loss, and alteration” of personal data. As we extend
    our compliance program to meet the requirements of GDPR, we are adjusting our
    definition of breach to the more stringent GDPR definition.\n \n## What is a GDPR
    Data Breach?\n\nGDPR, in the definitions section of the regulation (Article 4),
    defines a “personal data breach” in the following way:\n \n> Personal data breach
    means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction,
    loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted,
    stored or otherwise processed.”\n\n## What's the difference?\n\nThe other difference
    in data breach between [HIPAA and GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    is the actual type of data. HIPAA is only concerned with “protected health information”
    where GDPR is concerned with “personal data,” a much broader scope. One security
    strategy employed in the US to mitigate the risk of a data breach is to separate,
    logically in storage, personally identifiable data and health data. This separation
    reduces the likelihood of protected health information being breached. Under GDPR,
    this strategy, while good to employ from a security and exposure perspective,
    does not mitigate the risk of personal data breach.\n\nThe differences in terminology
    between these definitions can be subtle. But the impact is significant if you
    don’t explicitly articulate these terms to your workforce because they are an
    essential component of an effective monitoring program and to meeting the [GDPR
    data breach notification requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements)
    outlined in GDPR Article 33 and 34.\n\n*Learn more about GDPR — Understand the

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
