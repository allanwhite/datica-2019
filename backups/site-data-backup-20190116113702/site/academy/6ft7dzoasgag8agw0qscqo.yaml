  :description: General Data Protection Regulation
:summary: What is the definition of a security incident and data breach under HIPAA
  and GDPR and how do they compare? This article breaks down the key terminology.
:lead: We get asked all the time for the meaning of a data breach. It often comes
  up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident. It gets even muddier when
  the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought into the mix. While seemingly
  nitpicky, understanding the differences between these terms is essential to reduce
  your risk and to inform your partners and customers. Ambiguity and opacity is a
  not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and foundational definitions.
:post: "\n## What is a security incident?\n\nStarting with a security incident, which
  is less ambiguous, [NIST defines the term in 800-61](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)
  as:\n\n> A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation
  of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.”\n\nHIPAA
  has a very similar definition in section 164.304:\n \n> \"A security incident as
  the attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification,
  or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information
  system.”\n\nGDPR doesn’t explicitly define “security incident” so a safe path is
  to use the NIST definition if you want to comply with GDPR. GDPR does expand the
  definition of a “personal data breach,” as you’ll see below, so the distinction
  between security incident and data breach is less evident under GDPR than under
  HIPAA.\n\n## What is a HIPAA Data Breach?\n\nThe significant difference between
  a security incident and a data breach, or personal data breach, is the impact on
  individual data.\n\nHHS and HIPAA define a breach simply as:\n\n> A breach is, generally,
  an impermissible use or disclosure under the Privacy Rule that compromises the security
  or privacy of the protected health information.”\n \nAt Datica, we’ve used the [HIPAA
  definition for a data breach](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
  But GDPR expands on that definition to include not just “impermissible use and disclosure”
  but “destruction, loss, and alteration” of personal data. As we extend our compliance
  program to meet the requirements of GDPR, we are adjusting our definition of breach
  to the more stringent GDPR definition.\n \n## What is a GDPR Data Breach?\n\nGDPR,
  in the definitions section of the regulation (Article 4), defines a “personal data
  breach” in the following way:\n \n> Personal data breach means a breach of security
  leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
  disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.”\n\n##
  What's the difference?\n\nThe other difference in data breach between [HIPAA and
  GDPR](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/) is the actual type
  of data. HIPAA is only concerned with “protected health information” where GDPR
  is concerned with “personal data,” a much broader scope. One security strategy employed
  in the US to mitigate the risk of a data breach is to separate, logically in storage,
  personally identifiable data and health data. This separation reduces the likelihood
  of protected health information being breached. Under GDPR, this strategy, while
  good to employ from a security and exposure perspective, does not mitigate the risk
  of personal data breach.\n\nThe differences in terminology between these definitions
  can be subtle. But the impact is significant if you don’t explicitly articulate
  these terms to your workforce because they are an essential component of an effective
  monitoring program and to meeting the [GDPR data breach notification requirements](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements)
  outlined in GDPR Article 33 and 34.\n\n*Learn more about GDPR — Understand the requirements

  :summary: Cloud Service Providers doing business in the EU are Processors under
    GDPR—it's kind of like being a HIPAA Covered Entity in the U.S. Read more on GDPR
    Service Providers.
  :lead: 'General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) starts and ends with the different
    definitions of "Controller" and "Processor" and the relationship between the two.
    Using HIPAA as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a
    Processor is like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.

'
  :post: "If you are reading this, within GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of
    some sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece
    of health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a \"cloud service provider\" which means a Processor,
    which means this article is for you. Let's understand together the obligations
    Processors (and cloud service providers) have within GDPR.\n\n## GDPR Risk Allocation\n\nMuch
    like [HIPAA, GDPR](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/) is
    meant to outline risk allocation between business partners. It's a legal framework
    for risk, nothing more; as a framework GDPR does have more teeth than HIPAA in
    regards to potential financial penalties. The dirty secret about HIPAA is that
    it's nothing more than a set of recommendations, which is why a world of consultants,
    compliance experts, and legal frameworks exists to try to interpret and define
    the recommendations. GDPR is no different.\n\nIn terms of risk allocated to the
    relationship, Controllers assume primary risk, as defined in [Article 24.1](https://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html):\n\n>
    Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well
    as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
    measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed
    in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated
    where necessary.” \n\nProcessors then assume risk when engaging with the Controller,
    as defined in Article 28.1:\n\n> [W]here processing is to be carried out on behalf
    of a controller, the controller shall only use processors providing sufficient
    guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such
    a manner that processing will meet the requirements of [GDPR] and ensure the protection
    of the rights of the data subjects.”\n\nBut most importantly, Article 28 continues
    to underline the obligations of Processors in section 28.3(f):\n\n> [The Processor
    is required to] assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations
    pursuant to Article 32 – 36 taking into account the nature of the processing and
    the information available to the processor.”\n\nWhen outlining risk, Processors
    have a lot of obligations. One way to interpret GDPR is that risk automatically
    flows down the supply chain, Controller to Processor to Sub-processor and so on.
    You will, by default, gain the obligations to abide by GDPR unless otherwise defined.\n\nThis
    is an important point: It's up to the Processor to tell the Controller where the
    line is drawn in the relationship, and not the other way around.\n\nMany of the
    major potential [GDPR hosting providers](https://hackernoon.com/why-gdpr-compliance-is-difficult-in-the-cloud-9755867a3662)
    are managing it this way already. AWS famously created their \"Shared Responsibility\"
    model, in which they outline AWS will own risk associated to compliance _of_ the
    cloud, like physical data centers, while its customers are responsible for compliance
    _in_ the cloud, like encryption, disaster recovery, and many more responsibilities.\n\nThe
    takeaway: If you are handling PHI in the cloud, within GDPR, you as a processor
    will assume the flow of risk unless you collaborate with your Controller partner
    to outline what risks you will not take on.\n\n## Data protection by design and
    by default\n\nProcessors must demonstrate \"data protection by design and by default\"
    which are terms from GDPR.\n\n**Data protection by design** is explained in Article
    25.1 as \n\n> taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation
    and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk
    of varying likelihood and severity for rights of freedoms of natural persons posed
    by the processing shall, both at the time of determination of the processing and
    at the time of processing, implement appropriate technical and organisational
    measures, such as pseudonymisation which are designed to implement the data protection
    principles in an effective manner in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR
    and protect the rights of data subjects.”\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection by
    design_ means that the product or service is built on top of an existing compliance
    and security framework. This is loosely similar to the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica.com/academy/the-hipaa-security-rule/).\n\n**Data
    protection by default** is explained in Article 25.1 as\n\n> The controller shall
    implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that,
    by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of
    the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal
    data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and
    their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default
    personal data are not made accessible without the individual’s intervention to
    an indefinite number of natural persons.\"\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection
    by default_ means that the product or service has operational controls on top
    of data access. In HIPAA terms, this is loosely similar to the Privacy Rule.\n\n##
    The role of HITRUST in GDPR Compliance\n\nThe reason to call out _data protection
    by design and by default_ for GDPR cloud hosting providers is to highlight the
    ultimate plan of action. In short, cloud providers need to use existing compliance
    and security frameworks to demonstrate operational control as it relates to both
    the technical construction of the product or service and the business processes
    surrounding the product or service.\n\nThis is very similar to HIPAA, which is
    where existing frameworks like HITRUST, ISO, SOC 2, etc. can come into play. Demonstrating
    GDPR compliance as a cloud service provider is important, but there aren't prescriptive
    ways to do so yet. [HITRUST or ISO certifications](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    can work as a proxy for GDPR compliance for the time being.\n\n*Learn more about

  :summary: One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program,
    including GDPR, is breach notification.
  :lead: 'One of the most challenging aspects of any security and compliance program
    is breach notification. “Beach notification” is actually multiple tasks — survelliance,
    investigation, and ultimately notification (to end users, partner, and sometimes
    media). It is time consuming, [expensive](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3234685/data-protection/how-much-will-non-compliance-with-gdpr-cost-you.html),
    and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead to more
    investigations. '
  :post: "The 72-hour security breach requirement written into General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating a lot of attention and angst.
    72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things that organizations are used
    to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals about a breach.\n\n##
    HIPAA vs. GDPR Breach Notifications\n\nIn the case of HIPAA in the United States,
    notifying affected individuals of a breach, especially when they number in the
    thousands or even millions, can be a massively resource-intensive endeavor; it
    is also very expensive. That said, in the United States under HIPAA often individuals
    are notified weeks or months after a breach is actually discovered. This is typically
    because healthcare organizations take time to investigate the scope and cause
    of breaches, mitigate the vulnerabilities that caused the breach, and develop
    and implement a process for managing notifications.\n\nThe [HIPAA Breach Notification
    Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification) requires
    that covered entities, or the delegates of covered entities (business associates
    typically), notify individuals and Health and Human Services (HHS) “without unreasonable
    delay and in no case later than 60 days following a breach”. 60 days is a lot
    of time. Breach notification under HIPAA is often a part of a [business associates
    agreement](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (BAA) between covered entities and business associates. In many cases, we see
    breach reporting times of 30 to 60 days for cloud service providers, which aligns
    with the 60-day breach reporting requirement in HIPAA. Datica guarantees 4-hour
    breach reporting in our BAA with partners because our philosophy has always been
    to proactively notify in order to expedite discovery, containment, and notification
    to individuals while minimizing the risk to our partners; delaying notification
    to our partners exposes them to more risk, not less.\n\n## GDPR Articles 33 and
    34\n\nThe GDPR breach notification requirement, contained in [Articles 33 and
    34 of GDPR](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf)
    and [in contrast to HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/),
    states that “the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not
    later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data
    breach to the supervisory authority.” 72 hours is not a lot of time, even only
    to notify authorities and not individuals. For organizations operating in Europe
    with HIPAA-oriented policies, changes are likely required.\n\nThe first step to
    bringing your policies and procedures into compliance with GDPR is to accept that
    [GDPR breach reporting](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/) is more prescriptive
    and more aggressive than with HIPAA, or likely any other compliance frameworks
    to which you are familiar. From this first step it’s a matter of running a stringent
    process to update both your technology and organizational practices. You will
    also want to review the breach reporting obligations that your processors and
    subprocessors have in your data protection agreements. And do all that quickly
    as May 2018, the date GDPR goes into effect, is rapidly approaching.\n\n*Learn

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.

    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
    back to the states, you must address EU-U.S. Privacy Shield — an additional privacy
    requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice.
  :blog_lead: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
    back to the states, you must address an additional privacy requirement laid out
    by the European Court of Justice. The [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome),
    which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies a stronger obligation
    on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either self-certify for the
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment. This [self-certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1)
    or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy Shield Framework requirements
    that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
  :post: "\nWhile everyone is gearing up for the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) that goes into effect for the European Union on May 25, 2018, one critical
    facet cannot be overlooked for customers who aspire to work internationally.\n\n##
    Q & A with Lori Meals\n\nDatica Director of Compliance Lori Meals has been gathering
    more details on the Privacy Shield and readying Datica for its own self-certification.
    She recently sat down to answer questions on the topic that will be helpful to
    you as you think through the necessary steps in bringing private health data back
    to the states from abroad.\n \n### Why are the privacy protections more stringent
    in the European Union than the U.S.?\n \nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to this sort of personal data being
    shared.\n \n### Why was the Safe Harbour Framework invalidated and the EU-U.S.
    Privacy Shield enacted in its place?\n \nAll comes down to [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).
    Remember him? He’s the former National Security Association (NSA) contractor who
    revealed that the intelligence agency had been spying on European citizen data
    held by American companies.  That snowball quickly rolled downhill to Facebook.
    Austrian student Max Schrems filed subsequent lawsuits, alleging that Facebook
    had not been protecting personal data of Europeans, as extrapolated from the Snowden
    leaks. Those leaks showed that the NSA performed surveillance on technology companies,
    like Facebook. His complaints landed in the European Court of Justice whose governance
    quickly invalidated the Safe Harbour Framework and exacted a seismic shift upon
    international data privacy.\n\n### Is the Privacy Shield certification required
    for Datica?\n \nNo, it is not incumbent upon us, but it is for our customers,
    assuming they are expanding into Europe and/or using European citizen data. Without
    the Privacy Shield, a U.S. company is potentially liable when not adhering to
    these principles.\n \n### What must a customer know about Privacy Shield?\n \nThe
    Privacy Shield has a couple of important vocabulary words: data controller and
    data processor. Datica would be the “data processor” because we only work on behalf
    of those who are collecting the data. The Privacy Shield lays out the data protection
    principles that gives an individual the right to know that a company not only
    holds your data, but that the individual can request that such data be deleted,
    updated or changed, as well as requesting copies of it.\n \n### Is there anything
    else that a Datica customer needs to know?\n \nBefore expanding into Europe, U.S.
    companies must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). The DPA signifies the agreement
    the parties’ have made with respect to terms governing personal data processing.
    Organizations will also need to contract with a 3rd party to handle complaints
    about how the organization handles data, should any arise. \n\n### How does this
    impact digital health companies long-term?\n \nThe rules and regulations have
    become more stringent upon U.S. companies involved with cross border data transfers.
    Abiding by the European requirements is imperative for staying out of hot legal
    waters. \n\nDatica exists to help make digital health companies successful whether
    they work solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial
    waters between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today.
    When everyone follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success
    and decrease the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\n"

  :summary: Cloud Service Providers doing business in the EU are Processors under
    GDPR—it's kind of like being a HIPAA Covered Entity in the U.S. Read more on GDPR
    Service Providers.
  :lead: 'General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) starts and ends with the different
    definitions of "Controller" and "Processor" and the relationship between the two.
    Using HIPAA as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a
    Processor is like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.

'
  :post: "If you are reading this, within GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of
    some sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece
    of health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a \"cloud service provider\" which means a Processor,
    which means this article is for you. Let's understand together the obligations
    Processors (and cloud service providers) have within GDPR.\n\n## GDPR Risk Allocation\n\nMuch
    like [HIPAA, GDPR](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/) is
    meant to outline risk allocation between business partners. It's a legal framework
    for risk, nothing more; as a framework GDPR does have more teeth than HIPAA in
    regards to potential financial penalties. The dirty secret about HIPAA is that
    it's nothing more than a set of recommendations, which is why a world of consultants,
    compliance experts, and legal frameworks exists to try to interpret and define
    the recommendations. GDPR is no different.\n\nIn terms of risk allocated to the
    relationship, Controllers assume primary risk, as defined in [Article 24.1](https://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html):\n\n>
    Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well
    as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
    measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed
    in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated
    where necessary.” \n\nProcessors then assume risk when engaging with the Controller,
    as defined in Article 28.1:\n\n> [W]here processing is to be carried out on behalf
    of a controller, the controller shall only use processors providing sufficient
    guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such
    a manner that processing will meet the requirements of [GDPR] and ensure the protection
    of the rights of the data subjects.”\n\nBut most importantly, Article 28 continues
    to underline the obligations of Processors in section 28.3(f):\n\n> [The Processor
    is required to] assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations
    pursuant to Article 32 – 36 taking into account the nature of the processing and
    the information available to the processor.”\n\nWhen outlining risk, Processors
    have a lot of obligations. One way to interpret GDPR is that risk automatically
    flows down the supply chain, Controller to Processor to Sub-processor and so on.
    You will, by default, gain the obligations to abide by GDPR unless otherwise defined.\n\nThis
    is an important point: It's up to the Processor to tell the Controller where the
    line is drawn in the relationship, and not the other way around.\n\nMany of the
    major potential [GDPR hosting providers](https://hackernoon.com/why-gdpr-compliance-is-difficult-in-the-cloud-9755867a3662)
    are managing it this way already. AWS famously created their \"Shared Responsibility\"
    model, in which they outline AWS will own risk associated to compliance _of_ the
    cloud, like physical data centers, while its customers are responsible for compliance
    _in_ the cloud, like encryption, disaster recovery, and many more responsibilities.\n\nThe
    takeaway: If you are handling PHI in the cloud, within GDPR, you as a processor
    will assume the flow of risk unless you collaborate with your Controller partner
    to outline what risks you will not take on.\n\n## Data protection by design and
    by default\n\nProcessors must demonstrate \"data protection by design and by default\"
    which are terms from GDPR.\n\n**Data protection by design** is explained in Article
    25.1 as \n\n> taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation
    and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk
    of varying likelihood and severity for rights of freedoms of natural persons posed
    by the processing shall, both at the time of determination of the processing and
    at the time of processing, implement appropriate technical and organisational
    measures, such as pseudonymisation which are designed to implement the data protection
    principles in an effective manner in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR
    and protect the rights of data subjects.”\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection by
    design_ means that the product or service is built on top of an existing compliance
    and security framework. This is loosely similar to the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica.com/academy/the-hipaa-security-rule/).\n\n**Data
    protection by default** is explained in Article 25.1 as\n\n> The controller shall
    implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that,
    by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of
    the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal
    data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and
    their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default
    personal data are not made accessible without the individual’s intervention to
    an indefinite number of natural persons.\"\n\nTo paraphrase, _data protection
    by default_ means that the product or service has operational controls on top
    of data access. In HIPAA terms, this is loosely similar to the Privacy Rule.\n\n##
    The role of HITRUST in GDPR Compliance\n\nThe reason to call out _data protection
    by design and by default_ for GDPR cloud hosting providers is to highlight the
    ultimate plan of action. In short, cloud providers need to use existing compliance
    and security frameworks to demonstrate operational control as it relates to both
    the technical construction of the product or service and the business processes
    surrounding the product or service.\n\nThis is very similar to HIPAA, which is
    where existing frameworks like HITRUST, ISO, SOC 2, etc. can come into play. Demonstrating
    GDPR compliance as a cloud service provider is important, but there aren't prescriptive
    ways to do so yet. [HITRUST or ISO certifications](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    can work as a proxy for GDPR compliance for the time being.\n\n*Learn more about

    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically

    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the
    academy article, [GDPR for Cloud Service Providers.](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)\n\n##
    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica.com/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
    experts](https://datica.com/contact/) today to find out how you can be compliant
