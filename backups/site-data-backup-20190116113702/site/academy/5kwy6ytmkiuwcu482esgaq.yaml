  :description: How cloud computing helps with innovation in health systems
:summary: While HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is heavy on technology,
  HIPAA Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and policy.
:lead: |-
  HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is very heavy on technology. Encryption of PHI while in transit, disaster recovery—these are intense technical considerations.

  Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and policy. While it's true major technological considerations exist—for example, don't store plaintext passwords!–components like Access Control Lists (ACLs) and credentialing are just as important as far as HIPAA goes.
:post: |+
  Here are a few domains to consider related to HIPAA compliance within a digital health application.

  ## Credentials and provisioning
  The value of a digital health product is the personal experience bestowed upon each user. That can't happen without authentication and authorization.

  Authentication is one of the primary threat vectors from malicious network actors, so getting it right is a major part of compliance. Often an existing enterprise already has an LDAP or Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism in place, so a digital health application will need to integrate with those on a customer-by-customer basis.

  Don't forget with onboarding new users that all communication here must be compliant and secure. For example, don't share passwords or PHI via email, and understand how email is one of the most exploitable threat vectors that exist in today's enterprise technology climate.

  Rotating passwords is a compliance requirement, so implementing a plan which helps users reset their password regularly and securely is a requirement.

  ## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  Access Control Lists, or ACLs, are a concept that manages what data can be seen by which users. ACLs are enormously complicated because there are many variables: People, roles, geography, employment, BAAs, plus many more factors. Being uncalibrated either way can be disastrous: On one side, you might get angry users who are upset they are blocked from seeing some data they should see. On the other side, if too much data is exposed, you violate HIPAA compliance and those people are even angrier. The former results in users not wanting to use your product and giving bad word-of-mouth recommendations, while the latter results in bad press and potentially lawsuits.

  Administration of ACLs has many dimensions. For example, an ACL could change situationally by user role and location.

  ACLs are managed at the application level and are a major part of HIPAA compliance.

  ## Usage audits
  Continuous auditing at the infrastructure and application levels is a requirement for compliance. At the infrastructure level, it’s things like process logging. At the application level, it's things like tracking which authenticated user saw what data when.

  Proper app audits track who saw what and when. Keep in mind these [audit logs need to be stored](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) in a compliant way as well since it's probable the logs have PHI in them.

  ## Technical considerations
  The good news about compliance at the application level is there are few "gotcha's" with regards to technology and security. Simply put, if the product is secure, then it will be compliant. The basics you would do whether you are in healthcare or not will cover HIPAA.

  For example, don't store plain text passwords. Ensure you don't leave open any form vulnerabilities which expose your database (good old [Bobby O'DROP_TABLE](http://bobby-tables.com/) will never die). Elements of that nature.

  If you do the basics all application developers should do anyways, you'll be compliant.

  ## Proving compliance at the application level
  Which leads to how to prove compliance.

  At the infrastructure level, it's easy—and common—to find a partner who does most the work. Maybe you are deployed directly on AWS and handle most of the compliance obligations yourself. Maybe you utilize [Datica's platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) to satisfy the entirety of HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level. The point is it's possible and common to let someone else take care of compliance at that level for you. The end result is _they_ will prove compliance on your behalf. For example, Datica is HITRUST CSF Certified and had 3 independent audits. Leveraging that is how you prove compliance at the infrastructure level.

  But the fact of being a digital health company, and the very nature of building an application, means _you_ own this level. You can't hand off the risks and compliance obligations to someone else. Consequently, it's on _you_ to prove compliance.

  The good news is it's possible. The bad news is it's not free.

  In short, the best way to prove compliance at this level is to get your company audited by an independent auditor, who will examine your company in totality, or the app specifically.

    the definition of cloud computing and different options in cloud computing.

'
  :post: |-
    As we work with cloud-based vendors and enterprises in healthcare, we're constantly fielding questions related to cloud deployments and models. This is our attempt to summarize what we've learned.

    I think we all *know* what cloud computing is, or at least we have certain associations and benefits that come to mind for the term “cloud computing”. NIST has a formal definition of cloud computing. NIST breaks down cloud computing into 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, and 4 deployment models.

    The **Essential Characteristics** of cloud computing include:

    1. **On-demand self-service.** Pretty straightforward. Users of cloud computing are able to provision computing resources (CPU cycles, storage, bandwidth etc) themselves. You can think of the AWS dashboard as the perfect example of this; if you’ve used AWS, you know exactly what I mean.
    2. **Broad network access.** Cloud computing resources can be utilized by remote clients using standard mechanisms. I think most modern developers think of web apps and APIs for this.
    3. **Resource pooling.** Computer resources are shared. Models like multi-tenancy and virtual machines are used to achieve this. The idea is that resources are dynamically shared, both up and down, between cloud deployed apps. This can present problems in the case of “noisy neighbor”, where your virtual neighbors are consuming and restricting access to resources. Hosting companies are pretty good at identifying and resolving these issues. But often not, which is why once companies begin to scale to larger volumes, dedicated instances become more interesting.
    4. **Rapid elasticity.** This is extremely powerful as it enables apps to scale up cloud computing resources as needed, on demand, to support peaks and troughs of usage. Instead of having to build and support high powered services 24/7, those services and resources will scale as needed.
    5. **Measured service.** Usage is metered, and cloud computing is typically billed on a per use basis. In the case of pure infrastructure, like AWS, you have little to no wasted money because you are only paying for what you consume. Consumption can include bandwidth, CPU cycles, storage, user accounts, API calls, etc.

    Most of these you probably knew of intuitively but, for us, it’s helpful to lay them out. We find there is a lot of confusion, especially in healthcare, about what cloud computing is, who’s using it, and why it is appealing relative to other models of computing. Much of the confusion comes into play when people interchange the terms virtualized computing and cloud computing; virtualized computing is often used synonymously with private cloud. Virtualized hosted environments do not typically allow for self service or automated resource pooling, two of the *essential* characteristics form above.

    The next categorization for cloud computing relates to the amount of control of the underlying resources. Which leads us to back to the NIST defined **Service Models**, which are laid out below:

    1. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS.** SaaS is a model for accessing an hosted application developed by a vendor. Typically access is through a web app, mobile app, or an API. And it is is usually billed by user, API calls, or seats and billing is subscription-based. Subscription-based models have implications for customers because of the low capital expense to get started and implications for SaaS vendors because of the high negative upfront cash flow outlay to grow (more on this in a later post). The classic example of SaaS is Salesforce CRM; Salesforce has moved into PaaS (Force.com) but it started as SaaS and still generates the bulk of its revenue from SaaS. If you’re a mobile developer you likely know Parse, Urban Airship, and Twilio. There are literally tons of other SaaS vendors, several of which we use at Datica - Box (just made the move from another SaaS - Dropbox), Zendesk, MailChimp, Intercom, Mailgun, Moz, and Close.io. This is the most limited, at least in terms of customer control, model of cloud computing.
    2. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).** PaaS models allow you to deploy and scale your own application to cloud infrastructure without managing servers and/or databases. You may have some control over the infrastructure but it is limited. Users of PaaS typically do not have access to the underlying operating system or network devices. Developers can focus on the application, written in a language of their choice, without worrying about building and maintainer the server to run it. The example most developers would think of is Heroku, which is part of Salesforce. There are others, like CloudFoundry and newer offerings like dotCloud. There is also a super cool compliant PaaS that recently launched that's called...yes, Datica!
    3. **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).** I think of this as the blank slate of cloud computing that has been the driving disruptive force in computing over the last 15 years. As opposed to SaaS and PaaS, which build layers of abstraction to interact with customers and keep them away from the OS, IaaS vendors provide customers with access to operating system and sometimes network components. You can think of it as a hosted linux prompt. AWS and Rackspace are the prototypes for this. This is usually the cheapest option. It's a blank slate, and developers can customize down to the OS level. With that control comes more responsibility and ultimately more time spent on infrastructure. The decision that needs to be made in assessing IaaS is whether time and resources should be spent configuring servers and databases, or does it make more sense to spend a little more money on infrastructure but have more resources for your core product and differentiation. Or in other words, should you choose a PaaS offering or stay with IaaS.

    In addition to service models, which basically define the level of control customers have over infrastructure, there are also **Deployment Models**, listed below, which define the group to which cloud computing resources are shared.

    1. **Private cloud.** Most often confused with virtualization, private cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by one entity, and can be on or off premise. This is the direction most larger enterprises will move to, including within healthcare. Datica maintains a compliant private cloud. The challenge with most current private cloud deployments is that they provide none of the capabilities that a public cloud (see below) provides such as auto-scaling, API based access to perform a host of tasks etc.
    2. **Community cloud.** In this deployment, infrastructure is shared with a group, or community, of users. We think of this as a shared private cloud, and it’s usually a community that has something in common. With Datica, we have a HIPAA compliant private cloud in which we host our community of customers; the commonality in our community is that our customers are concerned about compliance, so we’ve painstakingly created a compliant environment with multiple private private networks. Customers get their own private networks within the Datica cloud.
    3. **Public cloud.** This is the infrastructure that developers know best. In this deployment, the infrastructure is for public use. Pretty simple.
    4. **Hybrid cloud.** This is where things get interesting. In this deployment, there is a mix of two different models from above. Hopefully using Datica will provide a good example use case. We have a private cloud - Datica manages and maintains the cloud computing resources and it’s exclusive to us. For our customers, we set up private networks within our private cloud, so our private cloud is actually a community cloud for our customers. Additionally, we’re beginning to explore using public cloud resources for certain, non-compliant things such as code sets. In non-compliant deployments, if more resources are needed, such as the case with spikes in usage and/traffic, private clouds will burst into public clouds to gain access to additional cloud computing resources. Key here is to ensure that "post burst", the additional capacity that was spun up, needs to be powered down else month end bills could be a bit surprising.

    The reason we care about cloud computing, including the definition and characteristics of it, is that we firmly believe the benefits of cloud computing have not been realized in healthcare. And we believe much of that relates to a lack of understanding of what cloud computing is, and how cloud computing can be both compliant and secure. Current compliant offerings in healthcare, especially when you look at compliant cloud computing service models, sorely miss the needs of modern app app developers and the industry as a whole; we make the important distinction between PaaS and IaaS, and believe PaaS is the necessary approach to be compliant because of the myriad of compliance requirements beyond dedicated infrastructure. More to come on service models and compliance in a future post.

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.

  :summary: The cost of a HIPAA audit depends on audit type – HIPAA gap assessment,
    full HIPAA audit, or validated HITRUST assessment – and indirect costs like time.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > You must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. — Andrew Jackson

    At Datica we've been through [three external audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/hitrust/) conducted by a large, national auditing firm. In all three cases, I've personally led the efforts from our side, coordinating our internal resources as needed. I wouldn't call it a fun process, but it has helped add rigor to our internal security and compliance programs. It validated the hard work we've done to build a fully [HIPAA compliant platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), and associated organization, that exceeds the HIPAA rules. We've also learned what does and does not meet HIPAA standards from an external or auditor perspective.
  :post: "Cost seems to be one of a few gating factors for companies considering a
    HIPAA audit. It's certainly a topic we are asked about constantly. I touched on
    the cost of audits in my last post on [proving HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/).
    If you look at the cost of a HIPAA audit, it breaks into two broad categories.\n\n1.
    Direct costs\n2. Indirect costs.\n\nLet's walk through how costs are calculated
    in both.\n\n## Direct Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nThe easier bucket to calculate.
    It begins with the costs for an auditing firm to conduct the audit and deliver
    a report. Curiously, the auditor's charge is frequently used by most people use
    to calculate the overall cost of an audit, which is definitely not accurate. Different
    types of HIPAA audits exist. The costs are different for each. Datica has completed
    all of the audits below.\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment**. The best starting point.
    It is meant to identify gaps and remediation plans for those gaps. It's the cheapest
    option and least time consuming. It often does not require an onsite visit from
    an auditor. A gap assessment leads to a full HIPAA audit; after the gap assessment,
    organizations spend time addressing the gaps before beginning a full HIPAA audit.
    **The direct cost is about $15,000-$20,000.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit**. A full
    HIPAA audit, when applied to technology vendors, assesses an organization against
    all the [requirements in HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    It's a long list. It includes both technical settings and configurations as well
    as administrative requirements like training and business associate agreements.
    It will involve an auditor visit and will require documentation to support claims
    about security and compliance; this can include showing specific technology settings
    like password rules and guest access. **The direct cost is about $20,000-$25,000.**\n*
    **Validated HITRUST Assessment**. HITRUST is a more [complete, certifiable version
    of HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/). It was created by large healthcare
    enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but
    goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance
    programs. There's now a standard web app that you use to enter information. Those
    entries are then validated by HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization,
    reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you hopefully get
    HITRUST CSF Certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees
    to HITRUST and to your auditor (approved assessor). **The direct cost is about
    $30,000-$45,000** (cost can be much higher for larger organizations).\n\n## Indirect
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\n> It's really clear that the most precious resource
    we all have is time. - Steve Jobs\n\nIndirect costs are harder to quantify. The
    biggest factor to consider is time. For each of the types of audit above, the
    indirect costs increases as you move down the list. For each of our audits, we
    estimated the total time spent for all employees (we didn't break it out by each
    employee so it's not perfect).\n\n* **Gap Assessment: 40 hours.**\n* **Full HIPAA
    Audit: 100 hours.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment: 200 hours.**\n\nEqually
    hard to estimate was the time spent between each audit to address issues and \"harden\"
    our compliance and info sec programs. This time was not captured for any of the
    specific audits and contributes to the overall cost of compliance.\n\n## Total
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nWe conservatively estimated the cost of an hour of work
    to be $100/hour. This is partially loss for the cost of salaries + benefits and
    partially loss from opportunity cost of not doing other things with this time
    (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc). Based on those numbers,
    the total cost of the different audits are:\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment - $17,800-$22,800.**
    \n* **Full HIPAA Audit - $27,000-$32,000.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment
    - $44,000-$59,000.** \n\n## It's more than cost\n\nIf you are considering an audit,
    cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors
    that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For
    us, it was a nobrainer because our audits are part of our value proposition to
    customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having
    done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large
    deals.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply
    a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews,
    sort of like miniature audits. These too cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.
    We're working on calculating the overall cost of being [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    so stay tuned for more soon. Also, if you have audit insights you can share, [we'd
    love to hear them](mailto:hello@datica.com).\n\n"

  :blog_lead: "There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as
    part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do
    is to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier
    for developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce

    for healthcare. \n\nBy saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we
    are continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest
    addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding
    of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy."
  :post: |-
    This new chapter of the Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) will take you through the steps needed to prove your application works — from your first month in business all the way to the twenty-second. Here's what you'll learn, month-by-month in the [Evidence](/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea) section.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea" title="DSHF Evidence: Validating the idea" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 1</a></div>

    ### Validating the idea

    There are a lot of things broken in healthcare and few areas where you can say that care is optimized for patients, let alone providers. The challenge is that there are some strong industry debts, or ingrained impediments, that make some improvements in care unrealistic, especially on aggressive timelines.

    Because of this, the first step in a digital health evidence strategy is to engage with an expert, typically a care provider, champion, or administrator. The outcome of this engagement should be either 1) feedback to adjust the idea and assumptions underlying the digital health product or 2) an expert opinion, ideally in the form of a quote that can be used publicly, in support of the digital health product.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-develop-evidence-roadmap" title="DSHF Evidence: Develop an evidence roadmap" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 3</a></div>

    ### Develop an evidence roadmap

    Not all digital health product categories are created equal when it comes to evidence. The important thing to understand at this stage is how the different kinds of evidence apply to your product. If your product is integrated into care, like a digital therapeutic or a care management platform, then moving towards peer-reviewed evidence in support of the way your product improves outcomes, is necessary. If your product helps to fill empty slots in schedules, you likely won’t ever need to worry about peer-reviewed evidence but you will need to build a body of evidence from real customer data to support your claims of spots filled or recovering of lost revenue.

    It’s at this point that you want to roughly map out your evidence roadmap, which is simply a timeline of when you expect, or hope, to have different levels of evidence. Like a product roadmap, it’s going to be goal-oriented in that you need to back into timelines based on your goal delivery dates for different kinds of evidence.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-create-evidence-collateral" title="DSHF Evidence: Create collateral on evidence for  your product" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 6</a></div>

    ### Create collateral on evidence for  your product

    It would be nice to have a NEJM or JAMA article in support of your product but that’s highly unlikely at this stage of your journey. The goal at this stage is to empower your customer-facing teams with clear and concise collateral containing data about the benefits of your product from real-world applications.

    One additional thing to consider at this stage is customizing evidence collateral for your intended audiences. Maybe you only have one buyer but it’s likely there are other people involved in the buying process, especially if you’re selling to enterprises. Think about ways you can tailor the data, maybe even just the data you highlight, for different audiences.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-applying-healthcare-economics" title="DSHF Evidence: Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 12</a></div>

    ### Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution

    Healthcare economics is focused, at a high level, on the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare — everything from prevention and delivery to collections. [Wikipedia has a good primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics), though you could get a Ph.D. in healthcare economics because it’s that big of a subject.

    The thing that’s hard about healthcare economics is that what seems like a perfectly logical reason to implement a digital health solution, namely because it would result in better care, less expensive overall costs, and clear ROI, doesn’t always make sense.

    You’ll need to understand where and how economic benefits are realized. Many digital health solutions, especially those that target improving outcomes, benefit payors and not health care delivery organizations. This is changing with models that pay for value and not volume, things like readmission penalties and ACOs, but healthcare today largely still operates on volume and not value.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-add-credibility-to-evidence" title="DSHF Evidence: Add credibility and weight to your evidence" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 22</a></div>

    ### Add credibility and weight to your evidence

    By this time, you should have traction and will be looking to add new customers and implementations for your digital health product. At this stage, you should be thinking about how to expand the collateral you have already created by adding credibility.

    The best way is getting something published on your evidence. This doesn’t have to be in a peer-reviewed clinical journal but could be an online publication. Think of health management publications like Health Affairs. Or, it could simply be joint collateral with one of your customers.

  :summary: If you're going through a HIPAA security audit by a hospital or payer
    compliance office, auditing and logging will show that your application is secure.
  :post: |
    Auditing and logging are an important part of the HIPAA Security Rule, but there not prescriptive controls defined. According to HIPAA Security Rule - 164.312(b):

    > Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

    HIPAA goes on to say, in slightly more specific terms, that covered entities and business associates implement:

    > Procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies.

    Put simply, what HIPAA boils down to is that all access, both success and failures, to electronic protected health information (ePHI) should be monitored and logged and be accessible in the case of a breach. You should be able to go back to your HIPAA log and investigate what data was accessed, conduct forensics to try to figure out how that data was accessed in an unauthorized way and who may have been the person or entity that accessed it, and determine if/how data was altered. It's the who, what, when, and how of access that needs to be audited and logged.

    Auditing is so important because the integrity and availability of data is crucial in healthcare and in HIPAA. When ePHI data changes, is deleted, or is accessed in some unauthorized way, that represents a breach to HIPAA and is something that needs to be tracked both proactivel – using alerting and monitoring – as well as reactively, or retroactively, to investigate when an unauthorized breach might have taken place.

    The types of logs should include system and network logs. This is basically what goes into syslog on a *nix box and, ideally, the server has detailed logging turned on. Next, any application access and database access should be logged. The metadata (when, what, where, etc) associated with log data is extremely valuable.

    If you log enough data, you can proactively identify when a breach may have occurred with intelligent alerting. Once logging is properly configured, alerts are relatively easy to add. You can go back and investigate and dive deeper into what that the breach might be and ideally not just say "we store 100,000 patient records and our database was breached, so 100,000 patient records were disclosed improperly." With good logging, you should be able to point to the one, individual record that was breached and additionally maybe even the one specific piece of the record was breached (and how it might have or might not have been altered). That's some of the power of good logging.

    The approach that we take at Datica is to log every interaction with our systems - all API traffic - application logs, database logs, and system logs. For companies that use us as Datica Compliant Cloud, we give them one endpoint so that whatever application logs they are generating, we can store those for them; we'll also help them determine what data they should be capturing in application logs. We store the application logs, along with system logs that we generate, in an encrypted, dedicated store for each customer, and we provide customers with views and API access into that data.

    It's a very powerful unified logging service, one that's HIPAA grade and meant for ePHI. The service sits within our environment right next to your application and we combine your log data that we're already collecting on the servers and network traffic. We pull all that in into one place and give you a managed console for logging. Soon we'll be enabling customers to set alerts as well. If you're going through a HIPAA audit or assessment by a compliance office at a hospital or payer, this is a very powerful tool to assure them of the security and integrity of your application.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
