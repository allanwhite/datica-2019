  :slug: compliance
  :description: 'Compliance in this context usually refers to the costs and complexities
    associated with systems complying with regulations on security, privacy, data
    integrity, etc. '
:summary: With all the attention on compliance and the need for compliance artifacts,
  or evidence, to be successful, it’s helpful to understand more about artifacts.
:lead: "Artifact has been used both as a historical/cultural reference and technology
  term. But it seems to be gaining traction in the world of cloud as a term du jour.
  [Azure uses it to describe software packages](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/)
  that can be shared and ensure consistency for teams. [Google uses the term similarly
  for builds](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/build-test-deploy-artifacts).
  And AWS recently launched [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/), a portal
  for customers to gain access to AWS compliance reports. \n"
:post: "\nThe AWS use for the term artifact for its new portal is the most relevant
  for this guide. In this guide, we walk through the importance of compliance artifacts
  for an effective compliance program. Compliance artifacts are often synonymous with
  compliance evidence. Using this definition, this is a simple topic. But compliance
  artifacts in the context of the cloud are anything but simple. In today's world
  of cloud services, managed services, and APIs, the breadth of artifacts is massive.
  This article also touches on data artifacts that are being shed, often unknowingly,
  by cloud services and can contain protected data that needs to be handled as all
  other protected information is handled.\n\n## Introduction to Evidence\n\nWhen it
  comes to compliance, a [compliance maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
  is a good place to start to appreciate the value of evidence. While privacy defines
  the high-level policies for the management of data and technology, and security
  is the implementation of those privacy-driven policies, compliance is the effective
  measurement of the entire compliance program, from policies through secure implementation.
  Measurement is all about documentation, ideally on an ongoing basis, in support
  of a functioning compliance program and the following of compliance policies.\n\nHopefully,
  compliance is not seen as a checkbox within your organization. When compliance is
  seen as a roadblock or something that is bolted on after the fact, evidence is generated
  and stored for an auditor. It is not seen as having value and it is not used internally
  to monitor and improve compliance posture. Evidence should be used to [constantly
  internally monitor](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
  your compliance posture and ensure proactive identification of gaps, threats, and
  risks that can then be mitigated. A mature compliance program does not simply implement
  secure technology configurations and internal processes, it actively manages those
  configurations and implementations to proactively identify and resolve gaps, find
  areas for improvement, and, something we’ve seen at Datica, identify where there
  might be human resource gaps.\n\nCompared to the post-cloud world of today, technology
  choices and workflows were previously limited. Similarly, in a pre-cloud world,
  compliance evidence was more confined. Today, the cloud opens up a new world of
  compliance evidence in the form of both manually generated artifacts (most cloud
  providers can generate certain data and reports on demand) and automatically generated
  artifacts (APIs, logs, event streams, etc). The compliance-relevant artifacts generated
  by cloud services are not well understood or appreciated, either by the users of
  the cloud or by auditors and assessors.\n\n## Examples of Compliance Artifacts\n\nWith
  all the attention on compliance and the need for compliance artifacts, or evidence,
  to be successful, it’s helpful to see common examples. The list below is an example
  list from Datica. It is certainly not exhaustive and there are different tools to
  accomplish the same things.\n\n- __Jira Tickets__. We are heavy [Atlassian users](https://www.atlassian.com/)
  at Datica. In addition to general company documentation, we use Confluence for documenting
  and change control for our procedures. When it comes to artifacts, we leverage Jira
  tickets and projects to ensure we document how we follow procedures and provide
  a historical record, with all interactions of users, for all compliance related
  tasks. We use templating in Jira to minimize variability in compliance procedure
  workflows. Jira provides good integrity to ensure logging of activities on tickets.\n
  \ - __Event Reviews__. We have certain regular review activities we do per our policies.
  These are scheduled at some cadence from weekly to monthly up to annually. The most
  common examples are things like reviewing logs, vulnerability scan, virus scans,
  system inventory, etc. \n  - __Deployment Tickets__. We do security reviews as a
  part of our deployment ticket process. This aligns our operations with our configuration
  management policies and provides a separation of duties between security (reviewers)
  and operations.\n- __Workstation Configurations__. We standardize on MacOS machines
  at Datica and use [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) to manage those machines remotely
  and ensure hardened configurations are in use. Jamf reports are reviewed and logged
  in Jira but the actual report is also an artifact.\n- __Support Tickets__. Some
  of the events that are triggered by our scans are relevant to our customers and,
  in those cases, we sometimes use Zendesk to communicate with them. This means we’ve
  had to use Zendesk tickets at times for compliance artifacts.\n- __Cloud Configurations__.
  One of the new risk vectors with the cloud is configuring managed services from
  cloud service providers to comply with our compliance policies. This is very much
  an emerging area, one we go deep into in our [new book on cloud compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com).
  The challenge is not simply setting parameters correctly for cloud services (things
  like encryption and open ports and backups) but also ensuring those configurations
  don’t change. The configuration themselves would ideally be snapshotted to create
  a historical record of evidence. Some of this can be done today with APIs but much
  of it is still manual and bespoke for each cloud service and each cloud provider.\n-
  __Events__. We document our event reviews in Jira, as stated above, but the content
  of the events themselves are also artifacts. For logging, we leverage the [ELK stack](https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/)
  for immediate, shorter-term log storage and access. By policy, we move log data
  to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and retain that data for at least a year.\n-
  __System Inventory__. Doing a system inventory is a lot more difficult on the cloud,
  especially if you have a fleet of hundreds or thousands of instances and leverage
  managed services (like S3 above). In the good old days of data centers and purchased
  hardware, tracking sheets with serial numbers were the norm. Today, with virtualization,
  managed cloud services, and the on-demand nature of the cloud, system inventories
  are harder and harder grok, especially if you need accurate historical records.
  At Datica, we focus on retaining our monthly inventory, based on a mix of sources
  including cloud billing information.\n- __Network Diagrams__. This can also be more
  challenging on the cloud given the nature of virtualization and abstraction. We
  manage a lot of different cloud accounts and environments at Datica and typically
  try to enforce a standard network architecture across all of them. This network
  architecture is what we maintain and it is validated by our system inventory.\n-
  __People Operations__. Compliance is not just about technology. Some of the content
  that would historically be a part of an employee file also contains relevant compliance
  artifacts.\n  - __Employment Agreements__. Not all employment agreements are relevant
  for our compliance program and our HITRUST Certification, but some, like our IP
  agreements, are relevant and we have to provide them during our audits.\n  - __Background
  Checks on Personnel__. We conduct background checks on all new employees. We persist
  these reports as artifacts for future reference.\n  - __Security Training__. HIPAA,
  and most other compliance regimes, require regular security training. In reality,
  given the nature and value of digital data today and the role all companies play
  as stewards of that data, security training should be done at every organization,
  ideally tailored to the specific organization. At Datica, we require annual training
  and we document using G Suite (from Google). We also provide [open source HIPAA
  training](https://training.datica.com) if you’re looking for starter content for
  your own organization.\n- __Patch Testing__. Despite the adoption of the cloud and
  abstracted services from cloud providers (some levels of abstraction include the
  OS and software packages so patching falls on cloud providers), unpatched software
  is and remains one of the most relevant threat vectors. Patchers should be tested
  before going out to production systems and this patch testing should be documented,
  along with the ultimate patch information metadata when the patch is actually installed
  into production. Jira is a good tool for this as well.\n- __SLAs__. We have SLAs
  with the various cloud service providers (CSPs). As a part of our [HITRUST Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance),
  we are required to assess the performance of CSPs against their stated and committed
  service levels. We do this on an annual basis and we document it using Jira tickets.\n-
  __Risk Assessments__. Risk assessment, and risk generally, should be the driving
  force behind many compliance and security decisions. Full risk assessments should
  be done at least annually while mini-risk assessments, those that evaluate significant,
  and sometimes even small, changes to your technology and compliance program should
  be done on an ad hoc basis as needed. At Datica, we leverage a risk assessment template
  in a Google Sheet that is based on NIST standards for risk assessments.\n\n## How
  to Use Artifacts\n\nArtifacts should be used to 1) internally monitor and measure
  the performance of your compliance program and 2) externally validate your compliance
  program for auditors and other third parties. In both uses, organization and regular
  pruning of your compliance artifacts are essential (pruning doesn’t mean deleting).\n\nThe
  major challenge we’ve experienced at Datica is compliance artifact overload and
  consistent organization, especially with personnel changes (growth and departures).
  Your compliance program, and the associated evidence, should not be tied to any
  one individual and should outlast your team. This is easier said than done.\n\nAs
  you can see above, there are a lot of different forms of artifacts from the documentation
  of reviews (we use Jira for this) to logs to scans to SLAs to personnel files and
  more. We’ve tried multiple times to consolidate our tooling but, in the end, we
  still have a mix of Jira, Zendesk, AWS S3, ELK (on CSP), and G Suite. This highlights
  the volume and variety of compliance artifacts for a modern cloud company and the
  associated challenge of organizing those artifacts. We still use regular manual
  grooming to ensure things are in the right places.\n\nSince we’ve been unable to
  consolidate all of our artifacts into one tool, the key is to document, ideally
  within the procedures themselves, where each type of compliance artifact is stored
  and to ideally ensure there is a separation between those that create/store the
  artifacts and those that access/organize/prune the artifacts.\n\n## A Caveat of
  Securing Artifacts (and risks)\n\nBackups, APIs, logs, scans, tickets and more can
  and do create a lot of data exhaust. This data exhaust can be in the content itself
  or in the metadata associated with the artifacts. This data exhaust can contain
  PHI (logs are the easiest example to imagine this being the case) and, as such,
  needs to be secured and treated like any of PHI to which you are responsible. That
  means BAAs should be in place with any relevant tools/tech that are storing compliance
  artifacts and other protections, per your organizations’ policies, should be implemented.\n\n##
  Starting is the Hardest Part\n\nEffectively capturing and managing compliance artifacts
  is not fun. And it’s not easy today as most organizations use a mix of service providers
  for various aspects of their technology. But it’s necessary to effectively move
  up the [compliance maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/)
  \ and being a trusted party in today’s world where trust is an essential asset.\n"

  :summary: In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure, and
    ways to leverage a maturity model, such as the HITRUST maturity model, to optimize
    your compliance posture.
  :lead: Many people view compliance as a checkbox or something you just have to do
    in order to operate within a certain geographic or vertical market. While privacy,
    compliance, and security are not the same things, none of them are simple bolt-ons
    or checkboxes. Another common misconception is that doing security right means
    you are compliant. This is simply untrue and represents a historic view of compliance
    as a liability instead of as an asset to be used for competitive advantage.
  :post: "\nCompliance is not binary but when you think about it as a checkbox or
    afterthought you end up framing it in that way. The nuance of compliance is represented
    well in the maturity model now commonly used in practice for evaluating compliance
    programs and requirements. Maturity models take different forms. At Datica, we
    leverage HITRUST for our compliance program so use the HITRUST-specific flavor
    of maturity model, which in turn is based on the [NIST Program Review for Information
    Security Management Assistance (PRISMA)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir7358.pdf)
    methodology. In this guide, we will walk you through the reasoning, structure,
    and ways to leverage a maturity model to optimize your compliance posture.\n\n##
    The Purpose of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA framework was created by NIST
    to support the vast array of information technology and information security requirements
    of federal agencies. In this mandate, it has flexibility and extensibility built
    into the maturity model. This flexible structure is highly aligned with the needs
    of a compliance maturity model for the cloud as the cloud has a huge array of
    different technology implementations and use cases. Additionally, as we will see
    with the actual scoring of maturity models, the thresholds can be set differently
    based on the risk to specific organizations and information system environments.\n\n##
    Structure of the Maturity Model\n\nThe PRISMA model, and similarly the HITRUST
    maturity model, have five distinct maturity levels. For the purposes of this guide,
    we will focus on the [HITRUST maturity model](https://hitrustalliance.net/documents/csf_rmf_related/RiskAnalysisGuide.pdf)
    from this point on, which again is a modified version of the PRISMA with the first
    three maturity levels being the same. HITRUST, in its own words, buckets levels
    one through three as “design effectiveness” and levels four and five our as “operational
    effectiveness”.\n\nThe HITRUST maturity levels are outlined below with summary
    points.\n\n1. __Policy.__ These are the high-level policy and standard documents
    that outline the goals and define the overarching compliance program within an
    organization. HITRUST clearly states that these include “shall” and “will” statements,
    clearly articulating, in writing, the formal goals of an organization. The starting
    point for policies is often a mix of internal data privacy needs and external
    compliance regimes to which the organizations must attest and ultimately comply.
    \ These should be made easily accessible to all employees and contractors.\n2.
    __Procedures.__ Procedures define the ways in which policies are to be carried
    out or implemented as well as the specific teams and individuals that are responsible
    for them. In the simplest form, procedures outline how an organization follows
    its own policies. This can be an extremely detailed and difficult step but is
    essential to tying policies, above, to implementation, below, in a consistent
    and defensible way.\n3. __Implementation.__ This is the actual implementation
    of the controls (settings, configurations, etc) that are defined by procedures
    and mandated by policies. Once implemented, and ideally required by procedures,
    these implementations should have some initial testing performed to ensure baselines
    have been achieved.\n4. __Measurement.__ Ongoing, not one and done, testing of
    all three of the above maturity levels is required to successfully achieve this
    level. These are self-assessments performed internally within an organization.
    Baseline metrics or KPIs for policies, procedures, and implementations should
    be defined and tracked over time. Threats are dynamic, more now than ever with
    the pace of technology and the cloud, so those need to be continually assessed
    as well. In some respects, this maturity level is an ongoing risk assessment or
    a set of mini risk assessments.\n5. __Management.__ From our experience, “Managed”,
    as a maturity level, is the least well understood; it’s also rarely achieved or
    fully achieved, by organizations going through a HITRUST assessment. Managed is
    tied to Measured above in that it is assessing how an organization responds to
    the outcomes, or measures, of control testing. An example is when testing detects
    anomalies. In those cases, do organizations have processes and procedures that
    are followed to assess the root cause of the anomalies and then address or make
    changes as to ensure alignment with policies and procedures. One key activity
    in this level is setting metric goals and then assessing and responding to those
    over time.\n\n## Privacy, Security, and Compliance\n\nThere is a tight interplay
    between privacy, security, and compliance. Oftentimes there is confusion on the
    boundaries of each. Leveraging the maturity model is an easy way to differentiate,
    albeit with some gray area remaining, between these increasingly important functions.
    At Datica, we take this approach and leverage it to break down the maturity model
    to assess our privacy, compliance, and security independently.\n\nWe view Privacy
    as largely residing at the Policy level, with some input from Compliance in terms
    of external frameworks and requirements (like GDPR in Europe). Procedures are
    coupled tightly with Implementation and both align with the functions of Security.
    The last two levels, Measurement and Management, fit with the functions of Compliance
    to continually assess, certify, and document necessary compliance artifacts and
    corrective action plans.\n\n\n<div class=\"row bg-white collapse pad group align-middle

    is a Control?</h4>\n    <p>Example: <code>\"Users shall only be provided with
    access to\n    internal and external network services that\n    they have been
    specifically authorized to use.\n    Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n
    \   shall be applied for users and equipment.\"</code></p>\n    <p>Each piece
    of technology needs to go through a similar process.</p>\n    <p>This is an example
    <strong>Capability Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand
    the maturity of controls.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## How HITRUST Scores the Model\n\nScoring
    of the maturity model is complex and beyond the scope of this article. At a high
    level, each control, of which there can be hundreds, is assessed against the maturity
    model. The maturity model is not applied to an organization as a whole, but to
    each specific HITRUST control. For each control, each maturity level is rated
    as: \n\n* Non-Compliant (0%),\n* Somewhat Compliant (25%),\n* Partially Compliant
    (50%),\n* Mostly Compliant (75%), or \n* Fully Compliant (100%). \n\nThe percentage
    is supposed to coincide with a rough numerical equivalent. When completing a HITRUST
    assessment, there is a rating for each maturity level for each control. If you
    have 50 relevant HITRUST controls, you have 250 maturity ratings (50 x 5). These
    ratings are verified by 3rd party assessors and ultimately certified by HITRUST.
    These ratings are then used to calculate an overall rating, which determines if
    you pass or fail the assessment.\n\n## How to use the Maturity Model\n\nThe maturity
    model is an excellent framework to build, maintain, and optimize a full stack
    compliance program; in HITRUST terms, it can be used to both “design” and “operationalize”
    your compliance program. _Full stack_ in this context means _full stack maturity_,
    or successfully demonstrating compliance across all levels of the maturity model.
    In practical terms, even using the maturity model as a guide, there is not a time
    when you are “fully compliant” and can sit back and relax. Compliance needs to
    be ongoing and proactive, and the maturity model is a framework that can be leveraged
    to do that over time and to meet the myriad of new technologies, partnerships,
    data, and compliance tools.\n\nAt Datica, we leverage the [HITRUST maturity model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/).
    We used it to ensure consistency from policies, or privacy, through implementation,
    or security, to management, or compliance. We even classify the technology tools
    we use into the levels of the maturity model they help to address. An example

  :summary: If you're going through a HIPAA security audit by a hospital or payer
    compliance office, auditing and logging will show that your application is secure.
  :post: |
    Auditing and logging are an important part of the HIPAA Security Rule, but there not prescriptive controls defined. According to HIPAA Security Rule - 164.312(b):

    > Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

    HIPAA goes on to say, in slightly more specific terms, that covered entities and business associates implement:

    > Procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies.

    Put simply, what HIPAA boils down to is that all access, both success and failures, to electronic protected health information (ePHI) should be monitored and logged and be accessible in the case of a breach. You should be able to go back to your HIPAA log and investigate what data was accessed, conduct forensics to try to figure out how that data was accessed in an unauthorized way and who may have been the person or entity that accessed it, and determine if/how data was altered. It's the who, what, when, and how of access that needs to be audited and logged.

    Auditing is so important because the integrity and availability of data is crucial in healthcare and in HIPAA. When ePHI data changes, is deleted, or is accessed in some unauthorized way, that represents a breach to HIPAA and is something that needs to be tracked both proactivel – using alerting and monitoring – as well as reactively, or retroactively, to investigate when an unauthorized breach might have taken place.

    The types of logs should include system and network logs. This is basically what goes into syslog on a *nix box and, ideally, the server has detailed logging turned on. Next, any application access and database access should be logged. The metadata (when, what, where, etc) associated with log data is extremely valuable.

    If you log enough data, you can proactively identify when a breach may have occurred with intelligent alerting. Once logging is properly configured, alerts are relatively easy to add. You can go back and investigate and dive deeper into what that the breach might be and ideally not just say "we store 100,000 patient records and our database was breached, so 100,000 patient records were disclosed improperly." With good logging, you should be able to point to the one, individual record that was breached and additionally maybe even the one specific piece of the record was breached (and how it might have or might not have been altered). That's some of the power of good logging.

    The approach that we take at Datica is to log every interaction with our systems - all API traffic - application logs, database logs, and system logs. For companies that use us as Datica Compliant Cloud, we give them one endpoint so that whatever application logs they are generating, we can store those for them; we'll also help them determine what data they should be capturing in application logs. We store the application logs, along with system logs that we generate, in an encrypted, dedicated store for each customer, and we provide customers with views and API access into that data.

    It's a very powerful unified logging service, one that's HIPAA grade and meant for ePHI. The service sits within our environment right next to your application and we combine your log data that we're already collecting on the servers and network traffic. We pull all that in into one place and give you a managed console for logging. Soon we'll be enabling customers to set alerts as well. If you're going through a HIPAA audit or assessment by a compliance office at a hospital or payer, this is a very powerful tool to assure them of the security and integrity of your application.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
