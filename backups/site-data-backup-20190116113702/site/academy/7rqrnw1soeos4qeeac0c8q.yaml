  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: A risk assessment – a HIPAA requirement – is the first thing to do since
  it frames many decisions you'll make regarding your security posture.
:post: |
  Probably the first thing to consider when going down the path of compliance, or really the first thing to think about regarding security holistically, is to perform a risk assessment. A risk assessment is a requirement of HIPAA and it's really the first thing that should be done. The reason it's so important is because it frames many of the rest of the decisions you make regarding your security posture.

  In the words of HHS - "Conducting a risk analysis is the first step in identifying and implementing safeguards that comply with and carry out the standards and implementation specifications in the Security Rule. Therefore, a risk analysis is foundational..."

  From the HIPAA Security Rule - "Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the organization."

  As part of the risk assessment you need to outline your core technology infrastructure. In that process you should do an inventory of all the systems that you manage. Then you need to map out which of those systems process, transmit, or store electronic protected health information (ePHI). For us that's the starting point for risk management strategy and a risk assessment.

  The next step in a thorough risk assessment is to assess the various threats and vulnerabilities to your environment, and ultimately to the integrity of ePHI. These can be anything from physical threats, like breaking into a data center or a fire or natural disaster in your data center, to malicious software, like hacking into a system, to internal malfeasance, like an employee going rogue and breaking into your systems. You need to map out all of the possible threats and vulnerabilities.

  For us, we map vulnerabilities specifically to HIPAA rules related to protection of ePHI. For each perceived vulnerability, we assess the likelihood and impact - with the product of those two factors producing the risk level. The impact is the potential of a risk leading to a PHI breach - or a loss of PHI - because there are issues around integrity of data in HIPAA. We also determine if that risk has been mitigated in some way by our current security posture and controls.

  Once you know the infrastructure, risks, and threats/vulnerabilities, the next step is to mitigate the risks that exist and have not been fully mitigated by current security controls. Not all risks can be 100% mitigated. There are typically gaps in almost all risk assessments because if you do a risk assessment you will get a ton of different variables - not just the obvious ones at the top of your head right now. And, from those risks, there typically are some gaps that need to be mitigated. It's imperative that you come up with a mitigation strategy. Ask yourself what you can do that is reasonable and appropriate to mitigate risks to ePHI. From there, you need to implement those mitigation strategies and documenting thoroughly. Documentation is not fun but has to be done in a compliant industry like healthcare.

  We follow all of the steps above using a spreadsheet with sheets for each step, and we do ours both annually and on an ongoing basis, when there are changes to our core infrastructure. We use NIST standards ([NIST800-30](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf) and [800-26](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/Draft-sp800-26Rev1.pdf)) as the model for our [risk assessment](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#security-management-process---164.308(a)(1)(i)) at Datica. We're more than happy to share the spreadsheets and the steps and processes that we use to do that. If you want to reach out to us we can help you with that process. But that really is the first step that you need to do because that helps you really understand where your major gaps are. And it also helps you understand which things you need to do to implement or mitigate the risk that you have within, and the threats that you have to your infrastructure and to PHI -  that you're storing a processing or whatever it might be for covered entity.

  :summary: The HIPAA Privacy Rule is important to understand because it explains
    the types of data, covered entities, and uses of data HIPAA is concerned about.
  :post: |
    ## Overview
    The HIPAA [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/privacysummary.pdf) sets many of the terms used for HIPAA, outlines the types of entities that need to comply with HIPAA, defines appropriate uses or disclosures of health information, and also covers penalties for HIPAA violations. The Privacy Rule is important to understand, despite the fact that it doesn't include specific technical requirements or polices, as the Privacy Rule gives an understanding of the types of data, entities, and uses of data that HIPAA is concerned about.

    ## Entities
    The Privacy Rule defines two main categories of entities:

    1. *Covered Entities (CEs)*. These are the traditional players in healthcare - providers, hospitals, health systems, insurers. For some reason clearinghouses are called out as they transform and process health information for payers and providers; the clearinghouse that I always think of is Emdeon.

    2. *Business Associates (BAs)*. These are individuals and organizations that provide services and/or technology to covered entities. In the process of providing those services and technology, the business associate in some way process, transmit, or store protected health information (PHI). All software vendors in healthcare, if they somehow touch PHI, are business associates.

    A third category of entity or, maybe more accurately, a subcategory of business associates was added in 2013 as part of the HIPAA Omnibus rules in the HITECH Act. The HITECH Act defined a subcontractor as an entity that "creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of the business associate." A subcontractor is a business associate of a business associate. It can be a hosting provider, an email delivery service (email address), or even an analytics platform (IP address), if it in some way touches PHI. At Datica, many of our customers are business associates and we are subcontractors for them so we meet the new definition of subcontractor.

    The Omnibus Rule also defined a PHR vendor, offering a PHR through a covered entity as a business associate.

    ## PHI + De-identifying
    We devoted an entire post to "[What is PHI?](https://catalyze.io/learn/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi)" because it's an incredibly important topic in HIPAA. It's basically personally identifiable data (name, email, phone, etc) combined with some type of health-related data (medication, diagnosis, provider name).

    PHI can be de-identified by removing certain elements from the data, in a process called the [Safe Harbor](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#safeharborguidance) method, or through "[expert determination](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#guidancedetermination)", which seems a bit fuzzy to us as it is ripe for interpretation. The idea with both methods for de-identification is to make it so you can't identify an individual from a data set (duh!).

    ## Use or disclosing of PHI
    PHI can only be disclosed for reasons defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, or with written permission by an individual about their own health information. Other than providing access to the individual to his/her medical record, the Privacy Rule allows for disclosing PHI for three main reasons:

    1. *Treatment.* Probably the most obvious reason for disclosure, exchanging PHI between providers for treatment, management, and consultation happens all the time.
    2. *Payment.* In order to collect payments from insurers, disclosure of PHI is essential.
    3. *Operations.* We think of this as the catch-all bucket. It encompasses many administrative functions such as quality reporting and different types of operational analytics. This is also where disclosures for medical education fall in.

    There are some other, more obscure, reasons for disclosures. The most relevant reasons left are for legal reasons ("required by law"), worker compensation, and for restricted research purposes, amongst others.

    In some select cases – in particular, marketing – covered entities may disclose PHI but only with authorization from the individual.

    ## Minimum necessary
    One of the central tenants of HIPAA, as stated in the Privacy Rule, is minimum necessary use of PHI. The idea is relatively simple, don't disclose any information that is not necessary for the reason for which the information is to be used. For example, if you're trying to find out how much a patient owes for a particular procedure, you probably don't need to disclose that patient's allergies. In healthcare today, minimum necessary is usually observed by either specific HL7 or EDI X12 message types which confine the amount and type of data in a data exchange.

    ## Notice of HIPAA Privacy Policies
    Covered entities must provide individuals with a notice informing those individuals of their rights, as well as detailing other factors such as the protections the covered entity use to secure PHI. You probably remember getting and signing these every time you go to the doctor.

    ## Penalties
    The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), within HHS, is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA rules. In addition to civil (financial) penalties, there are criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing PHI or obtain PHI in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

  :summary: The HIPAA Security Rule describes the ways in which electronic protected
    health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected.
  :post: |
    The HIPAA Security Rule operationalizes many of the standards set out in the Privacy Rule. Specifically the Security Rule spells out, in various levels of detail, the ways in which electronic protected health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected. The Security Rule, despite setting implementation specifications, isn’t all that specific most of the time.

    The Security Rule is the section of HIPAA that gets most talked about by vendors like us and others with a background in technology. Many times developers and vendors focus specifically on the areas within the Security Rule to achieve compliance. Even with this area of focus, the specific technical controls only make up a minority of the HIPAA Security Rule.

    The HIPAA Security Rule can be broken down into the three main categories below.

    ### Administrative

    This is actually the largest category of safeguards in the HIPAA Security Rule, accounting for more than 50% of the rule. These are not server setting or specifics around technology, they are policies and processes that need to be followed to safeguard data. The biggest, and most important, area covered in this section, at least for people starting out on the journey towards compliance, is the risk assessment. A risk assessment should be the first step for most organizations wanting to be compliant, and covers documenting architecture, identifying risks related to the protection of PHI, and mitigating those risks.

    When you use Datica, we cover much of risk environment for you as we manage many aspects of the architecture. We work with you to define areas that you need to address in terms of risk, and will work closely with you if and when you decide to go forward with a full audit.

    There are other areas in this category including workforce security, contingency planning, training, and a few others, all of which are necessary to examine and address, but the risk assessment is really the big one in this category.

    ### Physical

    This category is easy to understand as it’s the physical aspect of securing systems that have access to ePHI. It breaks out to workstations, facilities, and different portable and mobile media. Most data centers today, including the ones that we use at Datica, more than meet the requirements in the HIPAA Security Rule for facilities. Typically compliant Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) vendors, like AWS and Firehost, cover this category of HIPAA for you.

    Areas people sometimes neglect are office security and workstation security. These aren’t hard safeguards to meet but they likely involve some process changes, like not allowing cleaning people into your office without supervision, keeping doors locked and tracking visitors, encrypting employee computers, and using workstation firewalls. We control and monitor access at our offices using a smart lock from Lockitron, which provides a nice log of all access.

    ### Technical

    The technical category of safeguards is usually what people think of when they think of securing ePHI. The biggest areas are encryption, access controls, and auditing. With encryption, it has to be end to end, and it has to be at rest. At rest is typically harder. We have found that we need to use high performance SSD drives to improve performance issues that arise with encrypting data at rest.

    For access controls and logging, basically all activity of servers should be logged and those logs should be monitored with appropriate alerting. All API calls should also be logged, including what was accessed (with ePHI at times), by whom, and when. We have spent a lot of time building a powerful and flexible unified logging solution to meet the requirements in this area.

    Beyond the three areas above, there are a few miscellaneous requirements in the security rule. Those additional requirements relate to signing business associate agreements and having policies to, well, manage your policies.

    That's a very high-level overview of the HIPAA Security Rule. You can see pretty detailed information about the Security Rule, and how we address the different specifications, on our HIPAA page.

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: There are many key security and privacy considerations for buyers to consider
    when exploring an M & A opportunity. Christine Sublett spells it out.
  :blog_lead: "Technical and financial due diligence have long been a part of the
    review performed by an acquiring company prior to a merger or acquisition (M &
    A). Cyber security has finally become an important business concern, and this
    requires information security to also be addressed with as much importance. Without
    appropriate security due diligence, the acquiring company runs the risk of introducing
    significant business and technology risk into their organization. \n"
  :post: "\nOne doesn’t have to look too hard to see an example where this did not
    occur; [the Verizon acquisition of Yahoo](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html)
    and the TripAdvisor acquisition of Viator are two recent examples (2016 and 2014),
    with [Viator suffering their breach only weeks after the acquisition](https://thehackernews.com/2014/09/tripadvisors-viator-hit-by-massive-14_24.html).
    And at the time of the Yahoo breach, Verizon used the opportunity [to express
    some doubt about the acquisition and to ask for more favorable terms](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-m-a-verizon-idUSKBN14P215).
    \ \n\nIt’s important to develop an M & A strategy, and data security deserves
    consideration in this process. Vendors that deliver services to healthcare organizations
    need to comply with a myriad of local, state, federal, and international privacy
    and security regulatory requirements. At the federal level there are sector-specific
    laws such as HIPAA. In addition, many states including California and Massachusetts
    have data security regulations that require organizations to develop, implement,
    and maintain reasonable information security programs. There are many key security
    and privacy considerations for buyers to consider when exploring an M & A opportunity.
    These include the following.\n\n## Data Security safeguards, policies and procedures\n\nAre
    the policies adequate to comply with applicable regulatory environments? Understanding
    and evaluating a company’s risk profile requires thoughtful analysis of the policies
    and practices regarding data collection, use, disclosure, transmission, storage
    and destruction. Does the company have a comprehensive information security program
    including appropriate policies and procedures? How does the company educate and
    train workforce members and third-party vendors with access to data? Do they have
    an appropriate data protection framework that classifies information assets? Do
    they have appropriate access control policies and procedures to reduce the risk
    of inappropriate access to information assets? What is their data retention policy?
    Do they have a vendor management program in place? Do they have appropriate contractual
    protections in place with their vendors? Do they have someone focused on information
    security such as a Chief Information Security Officer(CISO)? \n\n## Security controls
    \n\nAre the controls implemented by the company adequate and appropriate for the
    industry in which they do business? While HIPAA and/or HITRUST have numerous physical,
    administrative and technical control requirements, how a company addresses and
    implements these controls differ across organizations. Have they conducted any
    third-party audits or maintain [certifications such as HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/)
    or a SOC 2? Do they have disaster recovery and business continuity plans? Do they
    perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests? Do they perform security
    testing on their mobile app? Do they have an incident response plan, and do they
    test it regularly? Have they experienced any data breaches or security incidents?
    Do they perform appropriate background and security checks on new workforce members?
    Do they have policies and guidance on how data and systems are physically secured?
    Do they have appropriate solutions in place to know if they are experiencing an
    attack? Do they maintain appropriate endpoint controls to prevent compromise?\n\nIn
    addition, do they maintain a current data map or inventory? It’s critical to understand
    where data is stored, who can access it, and whether it is secured appropriately
    as part of an overall [information governance program](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/information-governance-survey-shows-benefits-in-compliance/).
    \n\nWhile security due diligence may show gaps in security posture, it doesn’t
    mean that the deal will fall through; rather, it will mean that the acquiring
    company knows what they are getting and then are able to appropriately price the
    deal taking into account both value of the acquisition, and cost to remediate
    security deficiencies.\n\n*Datica partner, Christine Sublett, is an information

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
