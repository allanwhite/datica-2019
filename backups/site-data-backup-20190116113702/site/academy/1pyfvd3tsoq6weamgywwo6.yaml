  :description: HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act that was passed by Congress in 1996.
:summary: The HIPAA Security Rule describes the ways in which electronic protected
  health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected.
:post: |
  The HIPAA Security Rule operationalizes many of the standards set out in the Privacy Rule. Specifically the Security Rule spells out, in various levels of detail, the ways in which electronic protected health information, or ePHI, needs to be protected. The Security Rule, despite setting implementation specifications, isn’t all that specific most of the time.

  The Security Rule is the section of HIPAA that gets most talked about by vendors like us and others with a background in technology. Many times developers and vendors focus specifically on the areas within the Security Rule to achieve compliance. Even with this area of focus, the specific technical controls only make up a minority of the HIPAA Security Rule.

  The HIPAA Security Rule can be broken down into the three main categories below.

  ### Administrative

  This is actually the largest category of safeguards in the HIPAA Security Rule, accounting for more than 50% of the rule. These are not server setting or specifics around technology, they are policies and processes that need to be followed to safeguard data. The biggest, and most important, area covered in this section, at least for people starting out on the journey towards compliance, is the risk assessment. A risk assessment should be the first step for most organizations wanting to be compliant, and covers documenting architecture, identifying risks related to the protection of PHI, and mitigating those risks.

  When you use Datica, we cover much of risk environment for you as we manage many aspects of the architecture. We work with you to define areas that you need to address in terms of risk, and will work closely with you if and when you decide to go forward with a full audit.

  There are other areas in this category including workforce security, contingency planning, training, and a few others, all of which are necessary to examine and address, but the risk assessment is really the big one in this category.

  ### Physical

  This category is easy to understand as it’s the physical aspect of securing systems that have access to ePHI. It breaks out to workstations, facilities, and different portable and mobile media. Most data centers today, including the ones that we use at Datica, more than meet the requirements in the HIPAA Security Rule for facilities. Typically compliant Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) vendors, like AWS and Firehost, cover this category of HIPAA for you.

  Areas people sometimes neglect are office security and workstation security. These aren’t hard safeguards to meet but they likely involve some process changes, like not allowing cleaning people into your office without supervision, keeping doors locked and tracking visitors, encrypting employee computers, and using workstation firewalls. We control and monitor access at our offices using a smart lock from Lockitron, which provides a nice log of all access.

  ### Technical

  The technical category of safeguards is usually what people think of when they think of securing ePHI. The biggest areas are encryption, access controls, and auditing. With encryption, it has to be end to end, and it has to be at rest. At rest is typically harder. We have found that we need to use high performance SSD drives to improve performance issues that arise with encrypting data at rest.

  For access controls and logging, basically all activity of servers should be logged and those logs should be monitored with appropriate alerting. All API calls should also be logged, including what was accessed (with ePHI at times), by whom, and when. We have spent a lot of time building a powerful and flexible unified logging solution to meet the requirements in this area.

  Beyond the three areas above, there are a few miscellaneous requirements in the security rule. Those additional requirements relate to signing business associate agreements and having policies to, well, manage your policies.

  That's a very high-level overview of the HIPAA Security Rule. You can see pretty detailed information about the Security Rule, and how we address the different specifications, on our HIPAA page.

  :summary: 'Understanding the HIPAA breach policy and having a breach notification
    checklist can prepare you in case of unauthorized disclosure of ePHI. '
  :post: |
    One of the most important aspects of HIPAA has nothing to do with technical security like encryption, backup, logging, or any of other requirements for securing data. What's important is what happens in the case of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, or a breach of ePHI. A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure that's not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

    HITECH Act Sec. 13402(b) Notification of Covered Entity by Business Associate states - A business associate of a covered entity that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured protected health information shall, following the discovery of a breach of such information, notify the covered entity of such breach. Such notice shall include the identification of each individual whose unsecured protected health information has been, or is reasonably believed by the business associate to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach.

    The majority of breaches are actually not software breaches. They're not hacking into a system that causes the unauthorized disclosures. Breaches affecting over 500 records are [published](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html) by CMS. You can see there's a searchable database of breaches that have occurred, how many records were affected and the type of breach. The vast majority of breaches are hardware breaches. The majority, if not almost all of the breaches, seem to happen because of [employee carelessness](http://rockhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/34f9a961f56ac6d3013d8b1bd266ef3b96fee194.png). It seems like it's almost always a contractor's laptop, often at the VA, that's been unencrypted and has been storing tons of patient records. The laptop is stolen from a car or a house or a coffee shop or an airport or whatever.

    "Hacking/IT Incident" only accounts for 68 breaches, a relatively small number. There is great potential to have a breach with a malicious hacker breaking into a private network or any sort of cloud storage, especially public cloud. This potential has fueled much of the slow pace of moving ePHI to the cloud.

    There are ways to mitigate that risk – and that is why we created Datica – but the important thing when it comes to a breach is actually having a process in place that details the steps to take in case of a breach. How do you assess what information was exposed in an unauthorized way and then how do you go about notifying relevant parties of that breach? The necessary notifications include anybody from the actual patient whose medical record was exposed, to the media, covered entities, and business associates. The notification policy should lay out plans for forensics to discover the extent of the breach and the cause of the breach. There is typically a chain of command that is outlined in a breach notification strategy that lays out, in detail, who is responsible for different aspects of notification and mitigation. The rules also put the burden on the business associate "of demonstrating that all notifications were made as required" by HIPAA.

    The policies should be consistent with what is in the requirements of a business associate agreement in as it relates to the timing to report a breach. HIPAA requires notification of a breach "without unreasonable delay" but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach. Most covered entities we've worked with want that timeline to be much shorter, and the range we usually hear is somewhere between 24 hours and 5 days. This can be a sticking point in business associate discussions. Some hosting providers have polices in place for breach reporting that are 30 days, 45 days, or even 60 days out; this is not typically inline with what a hospital, payer, or another large healthcare enterprise would expect from a business associate agreement and a breach policy for a business associate that they are working with. Despite the 60 day window, HIPAA rules also go on to require "evidence demonstrating the necessity of any delay." If it takes 60 days, there have to be reasons given for that delay.

    Breach policy and breach notification are things that are extremely important. There are templates for breach notification, but the policy alone does not mitigate risk. There needs to be an understanding within the organization, business associate, or covered entity of what a breach is and what the breach policy is. There also need to be auditing and logging and other systems (IDS) in place to detect and investigate a breach. Detecting the breach is often the challenge which is why having a comprehensive audit log is necessary and, more importantly, being able to generate alerts off the log is critical. Look for something from us to help you address this problem shortly.

    At Datica we have [both](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#hitech-act-and-omnibus-rule:-it-security-provisions) a breach policy and a breach checklist that we can follow in the case of a breach. We've mock tested this policy and checklist to assure it makes sense and all relevant workforce members understand their roles. If you want to learn more about our policies for handling breaches, please just [ask](mailto:hello@catalyze.io).

  :summary: If you're going through a HIPAA security audit by a hospital or payer
    compliance office, auditing and logging will show that your application is secure.
  :post: |
    Auditing and logging are an important part of the HIPAA Security Rule, but there not prescriptive controls defined. According to HIPAA Security Rule - 164.312(b):

    > Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

    HIPAA goes on to say, in slightly more specific terms, that covered entities and business associates implement:

    > Procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies.

    Put simply, what HIPAA boils down to is that all access, both success and failures, to electronic protected health information (ePHI) should be monitored and logged and be accessible in the case of a breach. You should be able to go back to your HIPAA log and investigate what data was accessed, conduct forensics to try to figure out how that data was accessed in an unauthorized way and who may have been the person or entity that accessed it, and determine if/how data was altered. It's the who, what, when, and how of access that needs to be audited and logged.

    Auditing is so important because the integrity and availability of data is crucial in healthcare and in HIPAA. When ePHI data changes, is deleted, or is accessed in some unauthorized way, that represents a breach to HIPAA and is something that needs to be tracked both proactivel – using alerting and monitoring – as well as reactively, or retroactively, to investigate when an unauthorized breach might have taken place.

    The types of logs should include system and network logs. This is basically what goes into syslog on a *nix box and, ideally, the server has detailed logging turned on. Next, any application access and database access should be logged. The metadata (when, what, where, etc) associated with log data is extremely valuable.

    If you log enough data, you can proactively identify when a breach may have occurred with intelligent alerting. Once logging is properly configured, alerts are relatively easy to add. You can go back and investigate and dive deeper into what that the breach might be and ideally not just say "we store 100,000 patient records and our database was breached, so 100,000 patient records were disclosed improperly." With good logging, you should be able to point to the one, individual record that was breached and additionally maybe even the one specific piece of the record was breached (and how it might have or might not have been altered). That's some of the power of good logging.

    The approach that we take at Datica is to log every interaction with our systems - all API traffic - application logs, database logs, and system logs. For companies that use us as Datica Compliant Cloud, we give them one endpoint so that whatever application logs they are generating, we can store those for them; we'll also help them determine what data they should be capturing in application logs. We store the application logs, along with system logs that we generate, in an encrypted, dedicated store for each customer, and we provide customers with views and API access into that data.

    It's a very powerful unified logging service, one that's HIPAA grade and meant for ePHI. The service sits within our environment right next to your application and we combine your log data that we're already collecting on the servers and network traffic. We pull all that in into one place and give you a managed console for logging. Soon we'll be enabling customers to set alerts as well. If you're going through a HIPAA audit or assessment by a compliance office at a hospital or payer, this is a very powerful tool to assure them of the security and integrity of your application.

  :summary: The HIPAA Privacy Rule is important to understand because it explains
    the types of data, covered entities, and uses of data HIPAA is concerned about.
  :post: |
    ## Overview
    The HIPAA [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/privacysummary.pdf) sets many of the terms used for HIPAA, outlines the types of entities that need to comply with HIPAA, defines appropriate uses or disclosures of health information, and also covers penalties for HIPAA violations. The Privacy Rule is important to understand, despite the fact that it doesn't include specific technical requirements or polices, as the Privacy Rule gives an understanding of the types of data, entities, and uses of data that HIPAA is concerned about.

    ## Entities
    The Privacy Rule defines two main categories of entities:

    1. *Covered Entities (CEs)*. These are the traditional players in healthcare - providers, hospitals, health systems, insurers. For some reason clearinghouses are called out as they transform and process health information for payers and providers; the clearinghouse that I always think of is Emdeon.

    2. *Business Associates (BAs)*. These are individuals and organizations that provide services and/or technology to covered entities. In the process of providing those services and technology, the business associate in some way process, transmit, or store protected health information (PHI). All software vendors in healthcare, if they somehow touch PHI, are business associates.

    A third category of entity or, maybe more accurately, a subcategory of business associates was added in 2013 as part of the HIPAA Omnibus rules in the HITECH Act. The HITECH Act defined a subcontractor as an entity that "creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of the business associate." A subcontractor is a business associate of a business associate. It can be a hosting provider, an email delivery service (email address), or even an analytics platform (IP address), if it in some way touches PHI. At Datica, many of our customers are business associates and we are subcontractors for them so we meet the new definition of subcontractor.

    The Omnibus Rule also defined a PHR vendor, offering a PHR through a covered entity as a business associate.

    ## PHI + De-identifying
    We devoted an entire post to "[What is PHI?](https://catalyze.io/learn/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi)" because it's an incredibly important topic in HIPAA. It's basically personally identifiable data (name, email, phone, etc) combined with some type of health-related data (medication, diagnosis, provider name).

    PHI can be de-identified by removing certain elements from the data, in a process called the [Safe Harbor](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#safeharborguidance) method, or through "[expert determination](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#guidancedetermination)", which seems a bit fuzzy to us as it is ripe for interpretation. The idea with both methods for de-identification is to make it so you can't identify an individual from a data set (duh!).

    ## Use or disclosing of PHI
    PHI can only be disclosed for reasons defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, or with written permission by an individual about their own health information. Other than providing access to the individual to his/her medical record, the Privacy Rule allows for disclosing PHI for three main reasons:

    1. *Treatment.* Probably the most obvious reason for disclosure, exchanging PHI between providers for treatment, management, and consultation happens all the time.
    2. *Payment.* In order to collect payments from insurers, disclosure of PHI is essential.
    3. *Operations.* We think of this as the catch-all bucket. It encompasses many administrative functions such as quality reporting and different types of operational analytics. This is also where disclosures for medical education fall in.

    There are some other, more obscure, reasons for disclosures. The most relevant reasons left are for legal reasons ("required by law"), worker compensation, and for restricted research purposes, amongst others.

    In some select cases – in particular, marketing – covered entities may disclose PHI but only with authorization from the individual.

    ## Minimum necessary
    One of the central tenants of HIPAA, as stated in the Privacy Rule, is minimum necessary use of PHI. The idea is relatively simple, don't disclose any information that is not necessary for the reason for which the information is to be used. For example, if you're trying to find out how much a patient owes for a particular procedure, you probably don't need to disclose that patient's allergies. In healthcare today, minimum necessary is usually observed by either specific HL7 or EDI X12 message types which confine the amount and type of data in a data exchange.

    ## Notice of HIPAA Privacy Policies
    Covered entities must provide individuals with a notice informing those individuals of their rights, as well as detailing other factors such as the protections the covered entity use to secure PHI. You probably remember getting and signing these every time you go to the doctor.

    ## Penalties
    The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), within HHS, is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA rules. In addition to civil (financial) penalties, there are criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing PHI or obtain PHI in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

  :lead: 'The spirit of HIPAA is pretty simple. It''s first main purpose is to secure
    and protect personal health information and, second, to enforce standards for
    electronic transactions in healthcare. Sounds simple, right? It is simple, but
    there''s still a lot of information you need to know to get started with HIPAA.
    This page is your resource to everything you need to know about HIPAA. '
  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
