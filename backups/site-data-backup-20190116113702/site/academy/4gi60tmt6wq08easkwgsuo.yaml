  Is Meaningful Use dead? Learn the MIPS APM and MACRA acronyms and more.
:lead: |-
  There is confusion in the industry around MACRA, MIPs, and APMs. It begs the question, Is Meaningful Use dead? The confusion is justified as the topic is both broad and dense, especially since we’ve been operating in a world of acronyms under the “Medicare EHR incentive program”—more commonly called Meaningful Use—for years.

  This article will outline old program terminology and how they’re being replaced with new incentive programs. It will dive into the new program structures and provide links to helpful resources so you can cut through the clutter.
:post: |+
  ### Get to Know the Acronyms

  Acronyms are no fun, but even worse are when old acronyms are replaced by new acronyms that mean essentially the same thing. It causes unnecessary confusion and wastes brain-power. This is partially what we are experiencing with MACRA and MIPS.

  #### Old Acronyms Being Replaced by New Acronyms

  | Acronym | Term | Description |
  |---------|------|-------------|
  | MU | Meaningful Use | The Medicare EHR incentive program is now a component of MIPS and is called Advancing Care Information. Will we start saying ACI? Probably. |
  | EP | Eligible Professional | What we used to call an eligible professional under Meaningful Use is now called Eligible Clinician (EC) within MIPS. |

  #### Net-New Acronyms

  | Acronym | Term | Description |
  |---------|------|-------------|
  | MACRA | [Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2/text) | Replaced the old way of doing business with a new business model focused on value based care. Or, in CMS language, MACRA, bipartisan legislation, replaces the flawed Sustainable Growth Rate formula by paying clinicians for the value and quality of care they provide.  MACRA created the Quality Payment Program. |
  | QPP | [Quality Payment Program]([Medicare Quality Payment Program](https://qpp.cms.gov/) | The single framework under which MIPS and APMs are administered. The goals of the QPP are described below. |
  | MIPS | Merit-Based Incentive Payment System | Incentive program aligning old models into a single model made up of components. |
  | CPS | MIPS Composite Performance Score | A clinician’s total MIPS score (a singular number) which is comprised of four scores from four weighted categories. |
  | QP | Qualifying APM Participant | Someone that participates in an advanced APM model at a higher threshold. |
  | APM | Advanced Alternative Payment Models | The QPP creates additional incentives for Qualifying Professional’s (QP’s) who participate in an Advanced Alternative Payment Models.  It does not create the APM or alter the structure of APMs. (Some think these should have been called AAPMs.) |

  ### What is the overarching goal?

  The goal of CMS is to increase the focus on quality and value-based care. By the end of this year, CMS plans to tie 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models and to tie 85% of fee-for-service payments to quality. To do that, the Quality Payment Program has been created and has two branches. Clinicians will either participate in MIPS or an APM. Most clinicians will be subject to MIPS. Clinicians will be excluded from MIPS if they meet a low volume threshold, are in their first year of Medicare Part B Participation, or if they participate in the other branch of the quality payment program, an advanced alternative payment model (APM).

  ### What is MIPS?

  MIPS is a single incentive program that streamlines three current programs within it: the physician quality reporting system (PQRS), Value Based Payment, and the Medicare EHR incentive program for eligible professionals (Meaningful Use for EP). It is important to note that the EHR incentive program for hospitals will continue; MIPS does not apply to hospitals. Also, the Medicaid EHR incentive program for eligible professionals will continue. MIPS will take effect in 2018 and MIPS begins adjusting payments in 2019. The fourth component of MIPS is new; Clinical Practice Improvement Activities.

  ![Adjustment potential](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5opGoVRPva4gISKImY82o0/905bdf716ec91c8a6e45ba6389660c29/academy-image00.png?w=760)

  MIPS is comprised of four Performance Categories which make up a composite performance score (CPS) of a possible 100 points. Clinicians can submit their individual score or a score for their entire group. The four performance categories are Quality, Resource Use, Clinical Practice Improvement Activity, Advancing Care Information. CMS will report the physician’s score publicly on Physician Compare.

  In 2017, groups will report year’s worth of data to CMS so a national threshold can be calculated. This is the MIPS performance threshold and it will be used as comparison to a clinician's MIPS composite score (CPS) when determining the appropriate payment adjustment in year 2019. Clinicians with a CPS higher than the national performance threshold will receive an upward adjustment of MPFS payments (up to 4% in 2019, increasing to 9% by 2023), while a physician whose CPS is below that threshold will be subject to a corresponding downward adjustment.

  ![How will Macra affect me?](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5IyfqPwN56G22q0QE0oQIq/116afdad3c083e0bc398dd4526f8e0f1/academy-image01.png?w=760)

  ### What is an APM?

  Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs) are defined by CMS as new approaches to paying for medical care through Medicare that incentivize quality and value. MACRA doesn’t create new Advanced Alternative Payment Models. Just as MACRA created MIPS, a program to change the reimbursement model, that’s the exact goal of MACRA under APMs as well; additional incentives for APM participation.

  Although the majority of clinicians will be subject to MIPS, those that participate in Advanced Payment Models at a certain threshold, such as Accountable Care Organizations, will be excluded from the MIPS program. To be considered as an APM, at least 50% of the participating clinicians must use a certified EHR technology. This threshold increases to 75% after year one. The group must also base payment on quality measures comparable to those in the MIPS program. Finally, APM entities are required to bear more than nominal financial risk. Eligible Clinicians can become Qualifying APM Participants if a certain percent of their patients or payments are through an APM. QP’s are eligible for a 5% lump sum bonus in years 2019 - 2024 and even higher in subsequent years. Only QP’s are excluded from MIPS.

  :summary: High performance scores and ratings can be a strategic advantage over
    competitors. Understand MIPS, including qualifiers, scoring, and threshholds.
  :post: "The scoring in MIPS is based on a composite score across four dimensions,
    summarized as:\n\n- Quality: based on Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)\n-
    Resource Use: based on Value-Based Modifier (VBM)\n- ACI (Advancing Clinical Information):
    based on Meaningful Use (MU) and \n- Clinical Practice Improvement Activities
    (CPIA): a new fourth category. \n\nThe scoring is out of maximum of a 100, but
    the formulas are not initially intuitive.\n\nEach performance category (PQRS/VMB,
    ACI, RU and CPIA) is scored separately as a percentage of maximum possible performance
    within that category. The category-level scores are then weighted by the appropriate
    category weight and then summed up, i.e\n\n> 50% x PQRS + 25% x ACI + 15% x CPIA
    + 10% x RU = CPS. \n\nIt is interesting to note that given this weightage and
    the way the scoring works within each category, physicians who have historically
    performed well under MU and avoided PQRS and VBM penalties may not have high enough
    ACI or MIPS Quality scores to avoid MIPS penalties. MIPS forces historically high
    performers to re-evaluate their performance status under MIPS, given how the MIPS
    scoring system differs from those of MU, PQRS and VBM. As a quick example, if
    eight measures were to be used in the quality category (and they are and all drawn
    from PQRS and VBM) and each earned eight points each, then the total points would
    be 8 x 8 = 64 out of a possible 80 points, or a 64/80 = 80%. But as the Quality
    category for the CY2017 performance year has a weight of 50%, then a quality score
    of 80% would result in the Quality category contributing 80% x 50% x 100 = 40
    points to the clinician’s overall CPS.\n\nNow let's consider the fact that the
    score obtained will be compared against *all other qualified*—i.e. MIPS eligible
    physicians—for a previous performance period. Based on a sample comparative chart
    published [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/09/2016-10032/medicare-program-merit-based-incentive-payment-system-mips-and-alternative-payment-model-apm#h-78),
    if each of those above PQRS measure is only better than 60% of peers reflected
    in the benchmark, then that measure would earn only earn 7 out of 10 possible
    points, i.e. the overall score calculated above would now drop to 70% x 50% x
    100 = 35 points.\n\n### Scoring in the Quality Category\n\nMIPS essentially adopts
    the quality measures and reporting methods from the PQRS and VBM programs. Although
    there are some changes to the PQRS reporting methods, for the most part the quality
    reporting methods remain the same.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. **Select
    a minimum of six PQRS measures, across any combination of quality domains**: Constraints
    are that one measure is a cross-domain measure if the clinician is patient-facing,
    and one measure is an outcome measure (or a high priority measure, if an outcome
    measure is unavailable). These measures can be drawn from the EHR, Qualified Clinical
    Data Registry (QCDR) and registry reporting methods. \n2. **CMS will calculate
    2 or 3 cohort based claims quality measures**: Two for individual clinicians and
    groups with less than 10 clinicians and three for groups with 10+ clinicians.
    This compares peer groups with each other and can have an additional impact on
    scoring.\n3. **Bonus points**: MIPS also provides additional paths to achieve
    a quality score of 100% by granting bonus points for certain quality reporting
    activities. So if two bonus points were earned in the earlier example, then the
    quality score would increase to (64+2)/80 = 82.5%, resulting in 82.5% x 50% x
    100 = 41.25 CPS points. \n\n### Scoring in the Advancing Care Information (ACI)
    Category\n\nMIPS changes MU (renamed to ACI) from an all-or-nothing compliance
    program to a continuous scoring system where MU measure rates are compared to
    benchmarks in much the same way as described for the MIPS Quality category described
    above.\n\nFor example, currently, if a clinician in the existing MU program achieves
    a performance rate of 15% on an MU measure with a compliance threshold of 10%,
    then that clinician is just as compliant with MU as another who achieves a 90%
    rate on the same measure. However, under the ACI scoring system, the former will
    only earn two out of 10 performance points, whereas the latter will earn 10 out
    of 10 points, according to the decile measure scoring scale. This explains why
    a historically high MU achiever may end up having a low ACI score if MU performance
    rates do not improve.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n> 1. **Base score**:
    \ The ACI category defines 131 ACI performance points that can be earned. 50 points
    are earned for reporting either a non-zero numerator or a “yes,” as applicable
    for measures selected. The ACI percentage score is calculated by dividing the
    number of ACI points by 100 and capping the percentage at 100%, should more than
    100 ACI points be earned. For example, 80 ACI points equates to 80% ACI performance,
    resulting in 80% (ACI performance) x 25% (ACI category weight) x 100 = 20 CPS
    points contributed by ACI.\n> 2. **Performance Score**: Up to 80 points for performance
    on eight measures per the decile scoring scale described above.\n> 3. **Bonus
    Points**: Up to 1 bonus point for reporting to an additional public health registry\n\n###
    Scoring in the Clinical Practice Improvement Activities (CPIA) Category\n\nUnder
    MIPS, a clinician can earn up to 60 points within the CPIA category. \n\nThe process
    works as follows:\n\n> **Base score**: Based on various rules (size, location,
    APM or medical home participation), physicians can earn either the full 60 points
    or some fraction thereof. \n\nThe CPIA percentage score is calculated by dividing
    the total CPIA points by 60. For example, 30 points would yield a 30/60 = 50%
    CPIA performance score, which in turn would deliver 50% x (15% CPIA category weighting)
    x 100 = 7.5 CPS points.\n\n### Scoring in the Resource Use Category\n\nMIPS rates
    clinicians for Resource Use (Medicare costs of attributed patients) based on 40+
    cost measures to account for differences among specialties. 40+ cost measures
    are to be used. The hope is that this variety of cost measures will be able to
    account for differences among specialties.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n>
    **CMS collects and scores based on historical claims data**: There are no separate
    reporting requirements for clinicians, as the measures are calculated based on
    claims collected by CMS.\n\nSimilar to the Quality category, measures can earn
    up to 10 points each on a percentile benchmark scale, and a resource use percentage
    score is earned by dividing the total points across included measures by the total
    possible points. The percentage score is then multiplied by the Resource Use category
    weight (10% for the CY2017 performance year) to deliver the CPS points contributed.
    \n\nFor instance, say a clinician earns 8 and 8 points respectively on two included
    cost measures. Then the category contributes (8+8)/20 x 10% x 100 = 8 CPS points.
    \n\n### Calculating the overall CPS score\n\nAssuming that the numerical examples
    used for the four categories as described above all apply to the same clinician,
    we can calculate a total CPS from the components as follows:\n\n> - Quality =
    (56 of 80 points) x 50% weight x 100 = 35 CPS points\n> - ACI = (50 of 100 points)
    x 25% weight x 100 = 12.5 CPS points\n> - CPIA = (40 of 60 points) x 15% weight
    x 100 = 10 CPS points\n> - Resource Use = (14 of 20 points) x 10% weight x 100
    = 7 CPS points\n> - Total CPS points = 35 + 12.5 + 10 + 7 = 64.5\n\n### Reputation
    and reporting\n\nCMS publishes provider specific performance measures through
    its [Physician Compare website](https://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/search.html)
    for consumers to browse and commercial or any other third party physician rating
    websites to use. As out-of-pocket costs grow, patients are looking for more transparency
    into clinician quality and the cost-value trade-off. A recent [JAMA study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1829975)
    found that 65% of consumers are aware of online physician rating sites and that
    36% of consumers had used a ratings site at least once. MACRA provisions address
    this consumer demand. MIPS will publish each eligible clinician’s annual Composite
    Performance Score (CPS) and scores for each MIPS performance category about 12
    months after the end of the relevant performance year. In addition, all statistically
    significant measure values in the Quality, Resource Use and Advancing Care Information
    (ACI) categories for each clinician will be available for free download. Activities
    reported for the Clinical Practice Improvement Activities (CPIA) category will
    be listed for every clinician. Physician Compare will continue to publish cost
    utilization data for all Medicare Part B clinicians.\n\nUnlike direct Medicare
    reimbursement impacts which can change year-to-year based on clinician performance,
    damage to a clinician’s online public reputation may take years to reverse. Conversely,
    consistently high performance scores and ratings can become a strategic advantage
    over competitors. So, while there are advantages to being on the high end of the
    range, short term scoring changes can possibly cause significant business impact
    on organizations. From a risk perspective, it does make sense to report at the
    cohort / TIN level rather than at the individual physician level as a way to aggregate
    and minimize variation. This also puts larger physician groups at an advantage
    for MIPS."

  :lead: "## What is the GDPR?\nGDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation,
    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
    applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the

    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
    experts](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/) today to find out how you can be compliant
