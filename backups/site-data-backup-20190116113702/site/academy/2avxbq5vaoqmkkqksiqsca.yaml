  GxP stands for "Good Practice" and is a set of operational controls for Life Sciences organizations working within the confines of the FDA.

  The FDA publishes its regulations on the back of NIST, which is why GxP largely follows NIST standards. There is no one authoritative documentation source for GxP, like we have the [2013 Omnibus for HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) or Articles from the European Union on [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). Instead, GxP is an industry-accepted definition of best practices mapped to FDA regulations.
:post: |
  ## GxP Compliance

  In many ways, GxP is where HIPAA was mid-2000s before [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) came along. Back then, HIPAA compliance was mostly whatever someone wanted to claim it was. "HIPAA Compliance" meant one lawyer's word against another. It's why business deals took six months just to get past the "But are you HIPAA compliant?" stage. Hundreds of consultants, auditors, and lawyers defined what they believed HIPAA compliance to be, and proceeded to use that as their definition for their jobs. You can imagine why HIPAA has been a mess for a long time. This is why HITRUST is such a boon: The industry is finally agreeing to a certified definition, which accelerates the 20-year-old mating dance.

  GxP is still in that situation. There is no certifying body to GxP compliance, so it's whatever someone wants to claim it to be.

  ## eCFR — (Electronic) Code of Federal Regulations

  The basis of cloud-based GxP audits stems from [CFR Title 21 Chapter 11](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d4649e96a61f20151121c218b3fec507&mc=true&node=pt21.1.11&rgn=div5). CFR Title 21 is intended for the FDA, and Chapter 11 scopes to electronic records. When a cloud services provider—like Datica—claims to be GxP compliant, the company is claiming that they were audited against an interpretation of CFR Title 21 Chapter 11.

  The bulk of the controls in a GxP audit are administrative and not technical. Whereas HIPAA, and HITRUST in particular, get very deep in the weeds of encryption, intrusion detection, and so on, GxP focuses mostly at processes and procedures to ensure quality.

    more here. '
  :lead: |+
    A Business Associate is a vendor who works with a Covered Entity within the terms set forth by HIPAA. A [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), or BAA, is the contract between parties who handle Protected Health Information, or PHI.

    The intent of a BAA is to outline ownership of risk and liability as defined by HIPAA. A chain of risk is then created as BAs sign BAAs with other Subcontractor BAs.

  :post: |2

    GxP does not have the concept or BAAs or contracts that outline risk. There is no concept of inheritance or chaining liability.

    The reason stems from a topic we discussed in [our GxP primer](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-gxp/): GxP isn't a government regulation with defined vocabulary or mandated procedures, like [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) or [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). Instead, GxP is an industry-accepted understanding of NIST standards adopted by the FDA in [CFR Title 21 Chapter 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/fda).

    Nowhere are BAAs or other contracts outlined. There is no risk passed down via GxP.

    Instead, when a cloud service provider, like Datica, claims GxP compliance, they are claiming that they have been audited against the interpretations of FDA guidelines. Whatever relationships that business has with its partners — like Datica with AWS or Microsoft Azure — is immaterial. For example, a customer of Datica is only concerned if Datica itself is GxP compliant; contrast this to HIPAA, where a customer of Datica is also concerned what BAA inheritance Datica has with its partners.

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"
