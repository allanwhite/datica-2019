  :customer_story_short: 'Propeller Health is a leading digital health company focused
    on improving outcomes in chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. '
  :customer_story: |-
    Propeller’s platform provides real-time data and analytics from connected inhalers to help drive adherence to therapy and identify patients that are at risk for exacerbations. Better information enables more proactive care and reduces cost. Propeller’s customers include hospitals and health systems across the US. Each client is different.

    The case study described here presented two unique challenges for a children’s hospital wanting to integrate Propeller’s solution for their pediatric asthma patients. First, both patient and caregiver data needed to be housed together within the EHR. Second, it was required that Propeller’s real-time analytics were integrated into the normal clinical workflow. Datica provided expertise to help solve for both integration and workflow challenges and enabled Propeller to help patients and their families learn to better manage their disease.
