  Emily joined Datica as VP of Finance, following a long career of working with small, entrepreneurial companies and helping them grow into multi-million dollar organizations.

  Most recently Emily was with iTriage as their VP of Finance where she saw the healthcare industry’s challenges and opportunities for improvement. Emily joined when iTriage was still an early-stage growth company and helped scale the organization up until, and after, they were acquired by Aetna.

  Emily’s passion for startups began early in her career when she moved to Bozeman, MT to help her father co-found the successful men’s footwear brand H.S. Trask & Co. The entrepreneurial bug hasn’t left her since.
