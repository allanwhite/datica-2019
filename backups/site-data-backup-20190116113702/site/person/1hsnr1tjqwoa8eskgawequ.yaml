:bio: |
  Author of 250 articles and 6 books, he coined the term “hospitalist” in 1996 and is generally considered the “father” of the hospitalist field, the fastest growing specialty in the history of modern medicine. He is past president of the Society of Hospital Medicine, and the immediate past chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine.

  In the safety and quality arenas, he edits the US government’s two leading websites on safety (they receive about one million yearly visits). In 2004, he received the John M. Eisenberg Award, the nation’s top honor in patient safety. For the past eight years, Modern Healthcare magazine has named him one of the 50 most influential physician-executives in the U.S.; in 2015, he was first on the list. He has served on the healthcare advisory boards of several companies, including Google. His blog, www.wachtersworld.org, is one of the nation’s most popular healthcare blogs. His 2015 book, "The Digital Doctor: Hope, Hype, and Harm at the Dawn of Medicine's Computer Age," received stellar reviews and was a New York Times science bestseller.
