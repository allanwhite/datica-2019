  :summary: We didn’t begin seeing the Clinical Transformation Officer role within
    healthcare in wide numbers until around 2014. Possibly this is due, in part, to
    the multi-disciplinary domain of digital health becoming widely viewed as providing
    an avenue for transforming healthcare at the same time. Today’s podcast with Ocshner’s
    Clinical Transformation Officer Dr. Richard Milani takes even those with limited
    knowledge of the role and provides context into how this role fits within the
    ecosystem of healthcare innovation. Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky,
    sat down with Dr. Milani while in New Orleans to speak at the HL7 Partners in
    Interoperability Summit, and visited with him to learn more about the innovations
    that Ocshner is delivering—and how this health system views clinical transformation.
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn what a Clinical Transformation Officer is and more on this unique role in healthcare
    2. Discover where the greatest cost of care is in the U.S. health system and how Ocshner is addressing it
    3. Get an inside view of why vendors’ pilot pitches fail and why some succeed
    4. Hear what has been added to the triple aim to bring it up to the quadruple aim
  :post: |-
    ### Dr. Milani responds:

    **On why health systems are adding Clinical Transformation Officers:** "We realize and recognize that we have to transform ourselves in order to be more cost-effective and achieve better quality outcomes — not only the U.S. but across the world.

    Their sole purpose is to be able to ready health systems for the needed transformation that is coming."

    **On value-based care:** "I think that it is the best thing that could happen for people, because at the end of the day you want to see a physician or go to a hospital that's going to deliver high value, high quality, safe care, in the most efficient way possible for you so you can get what you need done, get out safely and not have problems that occur, or repeat hospitalizations for whatever procedure you might have had."

      </a>
    </p>

    **On the largest constraints for delivery of new innovations:** "The biggest constraints are always going to be culture. We have to appeal to what is best for our customers and in this case patients are our customers; that generally helps things along. But typically the greatest difficulty you will have is culture and moving culture around.

    **On how the Ocshner innovation team works with the IT department:** "We are independent but we are close in terms of not interfering with the day-to-day job that they have to perform, which is to keep the trains running on time. They need to make sure that our EMR is up-to-date, operational, safe, effective, secure and those are critically important functions. We work side by side with them."

    **On the vendor approach that doesn’t align with a health system:** "What doesn't work is if a vendor is just purely just trying to sell their product and they are not interested ultimately in making this frictionless."

    > I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability.

    **On the state of interoperability:** "I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability. Having the information in one location where we can now categorize and do all kinds of things with that information to interact with the patient at the right moment, at the right time, and at the right place is critical for us."

    **On Ocshner’s transformation focus:** "Our mantra has always been the quadruple aim. Anything that we do from an innovation perspective tries to target at least one, if not all the principles of the quadruple aim, which is namely improving the health of the population, improving the quality of the care that we provide, reducing the costs of care for our population and finally, the fourth aim is now — how can we do this while improving the workload on the providers of care."

    **On ideas for clinicians and informaticists working at startups:** "Clearly, for any startup in the healthcare sector, it's going to be difficult for you to be able to sell whatever product you have, unless you have some real-world data and outcomes based on that data. I think it would be very important for any of these small startups to develop relationships with delivery systems to say: We've got this idea. Do you think this has legs? Not only to test it out, but to get advice and feedback. We provide counsel to a lot of small startups. Sometimes the way they imagine healthcare delivery to be is somewhat different than it really is."

  :blog_lead: 'What were healthcare developers and leaders reading to stay on top
    of their technology game in 2017? If the following list of top articles from the
    Datica blog is any indication, cloud and compliance were top of mind for many

  :post: "\n## The Hot List — What you read last year\n\n**[3 Common Misconceptions
    about Business Associate Agreements](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/):**
    \nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA
    and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main
    categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs), and business associates.
    The further down the line the subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the
    more confusion there is about who really is a business associate and who needs
    to sign a business associate agreement.\n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)*\n\n**[2017
    Healthcare Trends Part 1: The Rise of Patient as Consumer](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/):**
    \nThere’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed
    by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before
    in a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and
    often wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently.
    Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that
    follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These
    overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all
    sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty
    and new problems.  \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/)*\n\n**[2017
    Healthcare Trends Part 3: The Rise and Fall of the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/):**
    \nThis 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs,
    raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful
    Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs.
    In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained
    and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been
    at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to
    record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits
    to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.  \n*[Continue

    Data Breaches, and the HIPAA Conduit Exemption](https://datica.com/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/):**
    \nBy now you’ve likely heard of the CloudFlare parser bug that caused CloudFlare’s
    CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who
    you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event.
    \n\nAt Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs)
    relate to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application?
    If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?
    As it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly
    to these questions. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/)*\n\n**[FHIR
    is no Longer Just a Concept](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/):**
    \nI recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at the 2nd
    HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. This topped my must-attend 2017 events list
    after I attended the first event last fall in Boston. Here’s what I learned, saw,
    and enjoyed at the applications roundtable. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)*\n\n**[SaaS,
    PaaS, IaaS—What’s the Difference?](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/):**
    \nIn a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital
    health, including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered
    was that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped
    to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies
    are turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing
    complexities.  \n\nIn 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within
    the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought
    it a good time to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent
    in healthcare companies today. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/)*\n\n**[The
    Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/):**
    \nI saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?”
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.
    Even so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020. \n\nIn this article, we explore
    the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing
    in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/)*\n\n**[Announcing
    One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/):**
    \nToday we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with
    Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem
    of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament
    to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way
    possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. \n\nWe aim to empower the developer community to
    solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable,
    compliant, and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers
    need more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better
    pricing at scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard
    and Cerner Code. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)*\n\n**[5
    Steps to HITRUST Certification](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/):**
    \n“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST
    CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive
    beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and
    point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis
    Good, Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica. \n\nComplying with
    HIPAA and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can
    point you to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the
    various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification,
    the only way to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we
    have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure
    they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance
    easier for our customers. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)*\n\n**[Opportunities
    for Digital Health Vendors in the Pharmaceutical Industry](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/):**
    \nNaomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation
    and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as
    Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships,
    she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare
    professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the
    molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers.
    In our July, 2017 podcast \n\nDr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting
    in a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems
    innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working
    with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/)*\n"
