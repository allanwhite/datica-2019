:lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
  to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
  towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new value-based
  models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable care organizations,
  and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through this shift, healthcare
  organizations need to alter their priority of care from the provider to what truly
  matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives coincides with billions
  of investment dollars from organizations to implement electronic health record (EHR)
  systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the HITECH Act and other legislative
  mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical data and clinical workflows
  today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across thousands of organizations,
  meaning that the critical health data is siloed away as well, leaving it inactionable.
  The solution? Integration."

  integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
  that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
  Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face major
  obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information. Traditional
  health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal health record
  (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic standards to
  depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures. With
  all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate data
  from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
  in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
  the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
  by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration at
  the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs so
  that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Data
  Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain archetype
  or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange information.
  Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the others because
  it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration Matter?\nEHR
  integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It is the key to
  creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating healthcare
  data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve the current
  healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration allows
  the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured or unstructured)
  on different data storage systems such as relational database management systems,
  file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
  \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
  benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
  and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
  furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance to
  identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout

  [HL7 ACK/NACK](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hl7-ack-nack/)\n\n</div>\n\nHealth Level
  Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
  ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
  exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n \nThese
  standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from one party
  to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required for seamless
  integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data exchange to meet
  the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization offers completely
  free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of templates that help
  enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various types fall under the C-CDA
  but they all provide a common format to assist in health data exchange. This library
  contains nine templates, each of which has defined sections to harmonize the data
  across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
  (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved from HL7 by Grahame Grieve
  and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats and elements (known as resources)
  and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout

  Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
  making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many of
  the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
  into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
  will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
  get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
  solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These resources
  can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and
  administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives. \n\n###
  FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts – mobile
  phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication in
  large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
  healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
  to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
  that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
  tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and
  a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most efficient
  way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future of EHR Integrations."

  :summary: 'Mark Olschesky shares what he learned, saw, and enjoyed at the 2nd annual
    HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. Hint: FHIR is fast becoming a reality.'
  :blog_lead: I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at
    the 2nd [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable](http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/roundtable/2017/03/).
    This topped my must-attend 2017 events after I attended the first event last fall
    in Boston. Here's what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.
  :post: "## A Recap of the HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable\n\n### Datica's presentation\nI
    presented a demonstration of Datica, highlighting how vendors and innovation groups
    can use [Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) to build applications
    that aggregate hospital registration and scheduling feeds along with vitals and
    results from multiple organizations. They can then build the longitudinal patient
    records in an easy to query method. Of course, the underlying data storage format
    and query mechanisms are those provided by FHIR. It's an effective catalyst for
    companies building a new product that relies on data integration, especially from
    disparate sources. If you need to facilitate faster application development for
    you or your team, let us know and we’ll schedule a demo.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/MpnXJGu24MqkQo88WOWMu/f737b76a63cf82ad05e296baaa631752/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo.jpg)\n
    \n### More live demos\nWhile the last FHIR Applications Roundtable featured many
    \"conceptual\" demonstrations of applications, during this second roundtable we
    saw more applications directly embedded into EHRs; presenters demonstrated their
    apps within the Cerner and Epic EHRs. After this year’s presentations, I can say
    with even more certainty that FHIR is for real.\n \n### Real-life use cases for
    PHRs and patient-initiated interoperability\nPersonal Health Records (PHRs) have
    existed for years, but often lacked true utility due to their inability to integrate
    directly with EHRs and their associated patient portals. As such, most PHRs operated
    via manual patient entry of their data into the PHR software. This had changed.
    Multiple demos showed how PHRs could use SMART on FHIR to access data from multiple
    EHRs and patient portals, all with permissions and scope set by the patient. Live
    demos highlighted this functionality, including one given by Michele Mottini from
    CareEvolution showing access of data from Cedars-Sinai My CS-Link (powered by
    Epic's MyChart). As someone who operates primarily on the B2B side of interoperability
    but yearned for real solutions around patient-initiated interoperability, seeing
    that patients will have the ability to aggregate data from multiple portals and
    hospitals soon is exciting. A hat tip to Epic and Cerner for making this happen.\n
    \n### Need for API management\nA few vendors provided presentations on how access
    controls could be layered on top of FHIR for more pragmatic management of FHIR
    resources. It seems like [EMR vendors are remaining hands-off](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    in this space, leading other vendors to rush in to fill the gap in API management
    (including Datica!).\n \n### People from all sides of the healthcare technology
    spectrum\nThe ability to talk to employees from startups, publicly-traded companies,
    hospitals and payers, life sciences and pharma all in the same place is amazing
    at the Apps Roundtable. Once again, [people are investing time and resources in
    FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/). A data standard is only
    as good as its utility and more and more companies are pledging to utilize it.
    As someone who wants to see interoperability improved through pragmatic standards-based
    integration, this provides hope that we'll get there.\n\n### Duke is lovely\nAfter
    things wrapped up on Wednesday, I meandered around the Medical School. Taking
    a short walk from the hospital towards the Duke Chapel and Gardens on a nice sunny
    day provided a peaceful environment only steps from the hospital.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/32c1t5oUPSUSScGW0UM2gi/175e508b0ac48fb5a8492063b591199b/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior.jpg)\n\nDatica
    is a proud member of the [HL7 organization](http://www.hl7.org/). Basing our integration
    and data management approaches around standards like FHIR gives our customers
    the best chance at being future-proof vs. proprietary data formats built by other
    vendors. These HL7 events gives us a first-hand look at what others are working
    on and how we can help make that happen with Datica Compliant Cloud.\n\n*Get the

    for technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have
    accomplished what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order
    to improve accessibility of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally
    stored and can be viewed across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR
    implementations laid the information technology groundwork that would become the
    fabric of a healthcare transformation movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis
    Good wrote in a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
    the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
    \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
    with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
    And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
    solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do
    not, reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new
    solutions than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking
    this organizational transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The
    industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason that being able to
    access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation tools to
    innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single
    implementation of the standard [in a centralized data hub](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/managed-integration/)
    is the most efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients
    expect transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once
    were. They expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience
    because of their experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that
    patients are consumers in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
    of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare –
    has changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
    did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a
    mortgage. Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes,
    and clear, transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is
    what people have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n##
    Government mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are
    going to be required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.
    \ We’ve seen references to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
    [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
    Century Cures legislation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
    The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
    in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
    providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
    and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
    for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
    on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
    and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health
    Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables
    in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\n"

    Meaningful Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in [increasingly the adoption of EHRs](http://www.nuance.com/for-healthcare/ehr-meaningful-use-physician-study/index.htm). In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. [All of this data entry](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/4-000-clicks-per-shift-ed-physicians-emr-burden.html) has been at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.

    ## EHRs weren't built for the future of healthcare

    > "Your margins are my opportunity." Jeff Bezos

    The problem with EHRs is that the government and health systems spent billions of dollars on software and organizational change that doesn't address any of the challenges discussed in the [first][1], [second][2], and [fourth articles](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-4-healthcare-costs-and-challenges/) in this series. EHRs weren't built for the future of healthcare. Thankfully, change in healthcare is slow so the past and current state of healthcare will be around for a while.

    Additionally, as other sectors like life sciences move to own the patient as the end user, they erode the value of the EHR as the main hub of clinical data. I guess [Walgreens is the example of the opposite][6] case as it is rolling out Epic but my guess is Walgreens rolled out Epic for the reasons I cited above, namely ease of integration with existing providers and provider data.

    ## Gaining access to EHR data

    Just because EHRs weren't built for a future based on quality and value doesn't mean EHR vendors aren't rapidly trying to adapt EHRs to remain relevant for the future. One major example is easing access to EHR data through [EHR integrations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/ehr-integrations/). There are major EHR vendors that made, and still make, significant revenue by charging hefty fees for interfaces and data access. The industry is demanding, and the EHR vendors are finally conceding to grant, access to EHR data. That access is seen as essential to enable future-facing tools for things like patient engagement, population health, and clinical collaboration. For at least four to five years now, major EHR vendors like Epic and Cerner have been talking about providing modern web interfaces for EHR data. There's now a standard called [FHIR][7] that has been getting tons of attention as an API for EHRs. In 2017, we will see more and more EHRs providing access to snippets of data on an individual patient basis. It's hard not to see that as a very small and intentionally slow step towards opening up access to clinical data so the industry can really start to understand the power of that data.

    The other alternative for EHR data access is for providers to query a network of EHRs for data about a patient they are seeing. These networks of different EHRs have [in this way.][8] Epic already enables this type of sharing, in an Epic to Epic only way, for participating customers. Having a provider click, request, and view data from a different provider isn't really harnessing the power of data and is not going to significantly improve outcomes or lower costs. It will help with some inefficiencies in acquiring records from other providers but this is barely even the low hanging front of clinical data access.

    ## Are the glory days of EHRs over?

    This lack of alignment between EHRs, their business models, and the direction of healthcare as it [onramps to the cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/) shows EHRs as the hubs of care and clinical data, at best, are at their peak value and, at worst, have already peaked. This has massive implications as EHRs are the major software vendors for care delivery and behemoth companies that represent a significant part, in terms of dollars, of the total health IT market. Similarly to non-healthcare enterprises, EHRs over time will be eroded like Oracle, Siebel, and SAP were by Salesforce, Workday, and Slack. This is a ten to fifteen year process that is only now just beginning but will eventually usher in the new guard of enterprise health IT as it moves into the [healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).

    This will have a major impact on enterprise IT departments since many of those organizations have large proportions of people and budgets dedicated to managing EHRs. Additionally, most of the new guard of health IT will be [cloud based](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/) and not on-premise, as most EHRs are today. The cloud, specifically the [public cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/), is here now in healthcare. It'll be years before major healthcare enterprises fully adopt and move the majority of compute workloads to the cloud but the migration is starting, it's a big migration, and it starts with SaaS solutions that will chip away at the EHRs dominance. The broader shift to the cloud will drive additional significant changes to how enterprise IT operates in healthcare.

    Next week, for the [fourth and final article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-4-healthcare-costs-and-challenges/) in this 2017 trends series,  I'll share "_Healthcare costs and challenges are about a lot more than healthcare,"_ a look at the quest to reduce costs and improve outcomes in healthcare.

  :summary: 'HL7 message senders should get an HL7 ACK message in return. This article
    explains what ACK NACK means and the requirements for ACK and NACK messages. '
  :blog_lead: "In a two-way communication system that is properly using the HL7 standards,
    a receiving system will send an HL7 ACK (acknowledgement) message to the sending
    system to notify that the message was effectively received. In an archetypal HL7
    environment, the sending system will presume the message was not received up until
    the delivery of an ACK message is made from the receiving system. By way of explanation,
    if the receiver does not return the ACK message, the sender may safely assume
    there is an error and halt message transmissions. \n"
  :post: "### ACK Message Anatomy\n\nHere is an example of an HL7 ACK message:\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|APPLICATION|HOSPITAL|Catalyze|INC|201513112402||ACK|MSGID5183033|P|2.4|\nMSA|AA|MSGID5183033\n```\n\nIt
    is clear that this message consists of two segments: message header (MSH) and
    message acknowledgement (MSA). MSH segments indicate what application or facility
    generated the message, unique ID for send message, and indicates what version
    of HL7 the message complies with. MSA segments determine what message is being
    acknowledged and if it was successfully processed and received. Inside an MSA
    segment are two types of relevant information: acknowledgement code, indicating
    if the message was successfully processed and received, and message control ID,
    denoting the unique ID of the acknowledged message. \n\n### Requirements of an
    ACK message\n\n- Message is in HL7 format.\n- The value ‘AA’ is in MSA-1 (MSA
    segment, field number 1). ‘AA’ means that the receiving system successfully received
    the message.\n- The Message Control ID of the last message is in MSA-2 (MSA segment,
    field number 2). The original Message Control ID is found in MSH-10 (message segment,
    field number 10).\n\n### Values of MSA-1\n\n- AA - Application Accept (used for
    ACK)\n- AE - Application Error (used for NACK)\n- AR - Application Reject (used
    for NACK)\n\nMoreover, if the message was not successfully received, an HL7 NACK
    (negative acknowledgement) message is sent back to the sending system. A NACK
    informs the sending system that there was error in message processing.\n\n###
    Requirements of a NACK message\n\n- Message is in HL7 format.\n- The value ‘AE’
    or ‘AR’ is in MSA-1 (MSA segment, field number 1). AE is Application Error. AR
    is Application Reject.\n- The Message Control ID of the last message is in MSA-2
    (MSA segment, field number 2). The original Message Control ID is found in MSH-10
    (message segment, field number 10).\n\nIn short, standard HL7 protocol calls for
    ACKnowledgment protocol. Each time a system receives a message and processes the
    data, it is expected to send an ACKnowledgment message back to the sending system.
    The sending system is expected to keep on sending a message until it has received
    a ACK/NACK message. Without this standard enacted, data could be lost in transmission.\n\nIf
    you want to read more about HL7, check out some of our [HL7](/academy/hl7-101-a-primer)

    Integration is a buzzword in healthcare, and for good reason.

    As the healthcare industry transforms from the traditional model of volume-based care to new models of value-based care, there is heightened interest in patient outcomes, patient engagement in decision making, and patient satisfaction. Executives know aggressive inclusion of novel third party tools that solve real problems is paramount to meeting new metrics. Integrating several third party vendors is hard enough, while scaling a sea change is untenable. No one wants to do inefficient one-offs until the end of time.
  :post: |
    Increasingly health systems and vendors are partnering with Datica to [accelerate third party integration](https://catalyze.io/hl7). Hospitals get an ROI from the streamlined workflows while vendors, like [HealthLoop](https://catalyze.io/proof), appreciate offloading this unique expertise. The end result is faster, reliable integration on compliant infrastructure. Major cost savings are instantly realized by all parties involved.

    In a short period of time, Datica has hit several major milestones. Today, we are excited to share that we are processing over 6 million HL7 messages per month, with those numbers growing every day. This is a testament to the trust health systems and vendors are both putting in our approach to compliance, and our dedication to the highest quality service.

    We reached this milestone by expediting integrations with most of the common HL7 interfaces we all know and love, including...

    * Inbound and Outbound Registration (ADT)
    * Scheduling (SIU)
    * Orders and Results (ORM/ORU)
    * Notes (MDM)
    * Discrete Data (ORU)
    * Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) through IHE standard queries

    ...plus FHIR, ASC X12 feeds for Claims, and a multitude of suboptimal data access methods like CSV files that still proliferate data integration in 2015.

    Our customers' business opportunities have driven us to integrating with over 60% of the EHR market, including Epic, Cerner, McKesson, eClinicalWorks, Allscripts—just to name a few.

    Over the next several months we will be sharing with you specific integration stories from real customers, outlining the clear benefits, in the words of our customers, of leveraging Datica for integration. Datica is committed to the future of healthcare, so we are excited to share genuine examples of bettering patient care.

  :summary: Value-based care finally provides the incentives for enhanced interoperability,
    but who is going to pay the up front bill to get started? Vendors? Doctors? Healthcare
    organizations? Payers?
  :blog_lead: 'Coming to the end of our analysis of the five major barriers to interoperability
    is a look at the costs involved with this initiative. The [GAO report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672585.pdf)
    took such a comprehensive view into EHR interoperability that one has to wonder
    where the funds are coming from. Seventeen of the eighteen representatives in
    the study were actually from non-profit efforts or part of non-profit organizations
    – so, again, where did the money come from? Well the eighteen initiatives cited
    a variety of sources, including grants, a cornucopia of fees, charitable donations
    and funding from private organizations. If you’re wondering why so many origin
    points, the answer is quite simple – EHRs are expensive. Or, rather, HIT has always
    been expensive and an EHR is simply a bigger target for cost vs. the 30 legacy
    systems which handled what the EHR does now.

'
  :post: |+
    Have doubts? Take a look at this (incomplete) list of cost area considerations:

    - Data center or hosted costs
    - EHR licenses
    - Hardware
    - Internet bandwidth
    - EHR staff facilities
    - EHR maintenance
    - Support fees
    - Supplies, reimbursement
    - Third party software
    - Interfaces
    - Data migration and system conversions
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Policies and procedures
    - New modules or technologies
    - Specialty requirements
    - EHR customizations
    - And the list goes on...

    What has been reported by the [Michigan Center for Effective IT Adoption](https://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/web-site-disclaimers) is that EHR adoption has upfront costs and yearly costs ranging from $15, 000 to $70, 000 per provider. Costs will vary depending on whether on-site or web-based EHR deployment is selected with SaaS typically requiring providers to pay fixed subscription pricing models. The PTSO of Washington says that “every dollar spent on development = $1 spent to maintain over a three year period.” And those dollars really add up, especially when you’re trying to take on the feat of national interoperability.

    For such a feat to be achieved, one necessary cost is EHR customization. Initiative representatives reported that many EHR systems require many customized interfaces, which are specially designed connections to other health IT systems, in order to facilitate interoperability with other providers and organizations. That sentence has a lot of buzzwords in it, so allow me to simplify: it takes a lot of work to make the data gleaned from interoperability useful. These fees are ones the buyers of the EHR systems (i.e., providers) are responsible for. The overall cost to getting this type of work done is not always transparent.

    ### So what does this mean?

    We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Value-based care finally provides the incentives for enhanced interoperability, but who is going to pay the up front bill to get started? Vendors? Doctors? Healthcare organizations? Payers? It's hard to say. We'll find our more on how this will shake out in 2016.

    * **Hardware:** Unforeseen impact of activities may require additional hardware, such as backup servers for redundancy, new area workstations, and computer carts.
    * **Staff Requirements:** Staff hiring may increase due to project loads and timelines, which may include desk and technical support staff, staff overtime for specific project dates and activities , and re-organizational changes within user groups.

    Because going over budget on an EHR project is a real possibility, a strategic project leader needs to know the organization’s ability and willingness to pay for the prescribed budget and then go over budget. There is no question that the ability to pay the prescribed budget is a bare necessity. However, some commence a project without a realistic scope — “Start the project and we’ll find the money later.” This might cause delays, poor workmanship, or shelving of the project in the near future, but is not uncommon in healthcare. If an organization survives going over budget, the project itself lands on a solid foundation.

    Believe it or not, an organization surviving going double or triple the prescribed budget is ideal for the project success. However, when an organization cannot handle going beyond scope, project importance should be assessed alongside leadership, as well as scope size and resource allotment. If an organization is financially capable to spend beyond what is initially approved but leadership is not united in support, problems should be anticipated later on. If there is unwillingness to go beyond budget, potential errors, failures, and delays will happen. The EHR project may just become a pawn in the organizational power struggles and politics.

    In this scenario, it is best to remain neutral and divide the project into budgeted portions, then work towards incremental budget increases as soon as possible across segments. Asking for small amounts every month becomes much more digestible than asking for a mass amount upfront. Though before this scenario ever happens though, there are a few questions to answer that will better financially prepare you for an EHR project.

    ## 10 Financial Questions to Ask Before an EHR Project

    1. Can the organization pay for the prescribed budget?
    2. If the project goes beyond budget, can the organization afford it?
    3. If the project goes beyond budget, is the organization willing to fund it?
    4. What is the process of asking for more funding for the project?
    5. Who are the key decision-makers involved when asking for more funding?
    6. How did previous projects fare in asking for additional funding?
    7. From previous projects, what is the best way to ask for additional funding?
    8. What kind of data should be available for decision-makers to get additional funding?
    9. What kinds of delay and challenges should be expected when asking for additional funding?
    10. What is the impact to the project when additional funding is not available?

    Based on experience, the true secret to EHR project success is understanding that the factors that make the project successful are not contributory but rather become requirements themselves. This is the perspective that differentiates the amateurs from the real HIT professionals.

  :summary: Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined
    with Open-Source Connectors for the Datica Platform.
  :blog_lead: Today we are launching one-click installations of [Mirth Connect](https://www.mirth.com/)
    combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help
    solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution
    is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration
    in the best way possible.
  :post: "> Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. We aim to empower the developer community to solve
    the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
    and secure.\n\nThe launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need
    more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing
    at scale, and future-proofing for things like [FHIR](/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.\n\nDatica has been doing healthcare
    integration since October 2014, going through a [few iterations in pricing and
    packaging](/blog/announcing-self-service-and-free-trials/). Regardless of the
    iteration, our pragmatic, partnership approach remained consistent and accomplished
    a lot. In three years we built a team of experts to deliver on integrations and
    delivered over 150 live integrations into healthcare organizations, with many
    more in process. Historically it was a SaaS-based pricing model where customers
    paid a fixed fee per month per interface, per site or even an annual license to
    purchase site-based delivery. We did integration work in every major vertical:
    vendors, life sciences, healthcare organizations, and payers.\n\nTimes have changed
    since 2014 in the integration world. The cloud has gone from a taboo term in digital
    health to the default place to build 99% of new healthcare applications. FHIR
    has gone from a glimmer in [Grahame Grieve's](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1/)
    eye into an API platform that will soon be made available from most of the big
    EHRs. A new wave of digital health developers believe in openness first, even
    at hospitals as they look to commercialize IP in a digital format. There was no
    way to predict this would happen so fast (at least in healthcare, three years
    seems fast) but we are here now.\n\nOver the last three years, we learned the
    best way to help our customers was to teach them this point: there is no silver
    bullet to integration **but it is a problem you can solve with the right tools**.
    \n\nThat's why we are releasing the ability to deploy Mirth Connect with \"one-click\"
    into your [Datica environment](/platform/). You gain the expertise we've built
    on running reliable and available integration capabilities in one-click, deployed
    directly into your compliant environment on the Datica platform. Mirth, which
    is an open-source platform itself, is a great tool for software developers to
    use for integration. This is why we've written up documentation based on the hundreds
    of integrations that we've done which can teach you quickly how to [get started
    on using Mirth](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001535023-Mirth-Getting-Started).\n\n##
    Open-Source Mirth Connectors\n\nWe also [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
    for transforming data from HL7 to JSON. This is a major evolution for digital
    health teams. We do not believe in locking customers into proprietary APIs, so
    we have published everything we've learned at the transformation layer, with many
    more scripts to come. It's all in an effort to help you gain more transparency
    and confidence with [EHR integration](/discover/ehr-integrations/).\n\nThese connectors
    are a series of libraries that can be plugged into your Mirth Connect environment
    which immediately enable HL7 feeds for consumption by a restful API. We will be
    continuing to open-source content as we create it, including transformers to other
    data types like those for [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Office
    365 Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors).
    The only major limitations behind what we aim to open-source will be transforms
    which are based on vendor-specific connections or data models which we can't expose
    due to legal reasons (e.g. Epic Interconnect XML data models).\n\n## Integration
    Environment Details\n\nTake note: the integration environment is much more than
    just Mirth. Each environment has a bundle of tools important to successful integration:\n\n*
    Highly Available (HA) configuration of Mirth instances. HA operations of Mirth
    are not trivial. We make it easy, instantly.\n* HA configuration of Postgres.
    A supplemental database is important for initial message ingestion, and must support
    a similar HA nature for continuous connection.\n* Load balancers.\n* Network monitoring
    and usage alerts. Understanding the traffic usage is important for audit purposes.
    Additional alerting is important for ongoing management of a connection.\n* VPN
    Management. Remember, you do not integrate with Epic, you integrate with a specific
    site's version of Epic. Therefore you'll need a VPN for every integration you
    plan to make. Our VPN tooling makes it easy, combined with our expertise in how
    to ensure they stay connected 24/7.\n\nThe integration environment is available
    in both the [Standard and Professional plans](/pricing). The environment is not
    available for free trials (yet), but will be soon. Along with this update, we
    have now made VPN management available in the Standard plan as well, so people
    can get started with EHR integration for as low as $1,150/mo.\n\nWe're often asked
    how much throughput a typical environment can handle. The answer is _a lot_. A
    single environment with no modifications can handle as many as fifty site integrations.
    If customers need to scale throughput, they simply scale RAM. If you have any
    additional questions, [please reach out](/services/#cta). We're happy to chat.\n\n##
    Pricing Updates\n\nOne thing you may notice is that we do not bundle the integration
    environment with professional services under the name of \"Managed Integration\"
    anymore.\n\nOur customers that have greater challenges or unique needs can now
    purchase both separately since services are now optional.\n\nThis means digital
    health teams can get all the integration tooling they need — along with HITRUST
    CSF Certified, HIPAA compliant, secure infrastructure housed under one [Business
    Associate Agreement](/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    — for as little as $1,150/mo.\n\nThe other exciting news about Datica's pricing
    is that this scales much better for you. It's pricing that is truly aligned with
    your success.\n\n## The Future of Integration Is Open\n\nThis is a shift in how
    we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health
    companies. You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance
    and security, but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. This
    new option gives that to you with a single click.\n\nHealthcare developers can
    get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.
    We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration
    themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure.\n\nFor moments
    where projects seem too difficult, [our integration services team](/services)
    will be ready to jump in and help you with that lift. We see a world in which
    all of our customers can eventually own their own integrations and we want to
    provide the easiest path for customers to be able to manage that themselves. [Reach
    out](/services/#cta) if you have any questions, we'd love to help you out.\n"

  :summary: There's much a digital health company needs to know about EHR integrations.
    Here are 4 essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers.
  :blog_lead: 'During the past three years, we''ve done [a lot of integration work](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/success/).
    We''ve worked on more than 150 integration projects with almost 30 EHR vendors.
    We''ve done this work with big organizations and vendors to small FQHCs and niche
    EHR vendors. As a result of all this integration experience, we now have a pretty
    good grasp on the intricacies of how integration works. We can reasonably estimate
    how long it takes us to do a project and how that varies with different types
    of vendors. '
  :post: "> What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of
    a computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" -- Morpheus,
    The Matrix\n\nHowever, despite our progress, there are still hundreds of systems
    that we have not integrated with. In the ambulatory setting alone, there are more
    than 650 technologies certified for Meaningful Use Stage 2. While working with
    the top 30 already gives us a leg up and covers a majority of the industry, it's
    not uncommon for us to hear about a new piece of HIT technology that our customers
    and prospects are looking to integrate with. \n\nDespite your perceptions of us
    as an integration services team, we don't have any secret super powers to solve
    problems with interoperability. Our solution, as simple as it may sound, is just
    being the best at our specialized skill set as we can be. This means:\n\n- Writing
    interfaces and transforming data to programmer-friendly formats using Mirth, an
    open-source interface engine. \n- Setting up VPNs when needed on open-source Strongswan
    appliances.\n- Having a team of experts in health data and project management
    on hand to analyze project needs. \n- Everything hosted on the HITRUST-certified
    Datica Platform, staffed by a team of ops, security, and compliance experts. \n\nWhile
    we may know about obscure technologies that power integrations at a given EHR
    vendor, our process is likely similar to anyone else's when kicking off a project.
    As such, it's worth noting that **some projects may be impossible to complete**
    due to external constraints. Turns out that data blocking in healthcare is really
    a thing. So, if Datica is not helping you in your pre-sales process with customers,
    it's up to you to ask all the necessary questions to ensure that you will be able
    to successfully integrate your application with the EHR and site in question.
    \n\n## Four essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers\n\n###
    1) Can your EHR support my digital health product's scope?\n\n<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"
    alt=\"XKCD comic on complexity\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\">\n\nThe most
    common data integration formats we use to exchange health data are [HL7v2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)
    and CDA-formatted documents like CCDs and CCDAs. Even though these data formats
    are standards, this doesn't mean all EHRs support exchanging data through these
    formats. In fact, some EHRs have no integration capabilities at all. Make sure
    the EHR supports the data standards that you need. Particularly, make sure the
    EHR supports the data standards in the method you need them. For example, if you
    need CCDs *pushed* to you at the end of a visit vs. *pulling* them proactively,
    you will want to ensure the EHR has the capability to manage that process. There
    is a very real possibility here that the EHR may have no suitable integration
    technology, which may limit your data integration possibilities to flat-file style
    extracts or may require manual data entry to power your application.\n\nIt's worth
    noting that there are some integrations [that seem simple but are really complex](https://xkcd.com/1425/).
    For example, while it would seem obvious that any EHR could expose provider availability
    to schedule appointments, this is actually rare functionality. It's *easy* to
    know what appointments are scheduled/canceled but it's *hard* to know when you
    can schedule an appointment. Just because there are no appointments from 12:00-2:00
    doesn't mean the provider isn't doing hospital rounds or research. As such, what
    may have been an easy API query on Allscripts, Epic, and Athena turns into a nightmare
    of stored procedure R&D and database access requirements with smaller EHRs. This
    is why it's good to have experts on hand to help you understand the rules of the
    road and to match integration expectations to reality. \n\n\n### 2) Do you have
    the internal or external resources to perform the integration work?\n\nSmaller
    organizations may have an EHR with HL7, CDA, or API integration capabilities,
    however, they might not have the personnel to configure their instance to do that
    integration. It's not uncommon to find a nurse or clinic administrator who is
    also the EHR administrator. While they may be able to manage their provider's
    schedules or handle some claims, setting up an interface or API may be foreign
    to them. This can be a blocker for a project. \n\nDatica cannot directly assist
    with a backend EHR build. This is usually for one of these reasons:\n\n- The EHR
    vendor would require us to sign an agreement that had some kind of non-compete
    clause to it. \n- The EHR vendor will not grant us access to their systems. \n-
    We simply lack the expertise in 650 EHRs. \n\nAs such, if the organization needs
    assistance with an internal EHR build, it's out of the scope of our standard integration
    services. While we may be able to refer the organization to other consultants
    or vendors who can assist with this EHR build, additional scope and cost considerations
    would be included.\n\n### 3) Can you commit to getting work done within reasonable
    timelines?\n\nThe top KPI for a fast, successful installation is an agreed upon
    project plan with assigned task owners and due dates. At larger orgs, the only
    task owners are typically the EHR integrators (Datica) and organizational IT.
    However, in some integrations, there may be dependencies on vendors to perform
    some pieces of setup. This is particularly true if the org is not licensed for
    a given interface yet or if the EHR vendor hosts the organization's EHR instance.
    \n\nNot to sell you a horror story but, sometimes, these timelines can be brutal.
    While many projects go live within a month of kickoff, we've also seen projects
    span a year due to EHR vendors dragging their feet on either contracting or infrastructure
    deployments. Other than badgering effectively, unless your customer's organization
    can push their EHR vendor to move faster, it's hard to make the process any faster
    than it is. If your integrated product must be live by a certain point to reach
    contractual obligations to your customer, make sure your customer has the means
    to get that system live by that point. \n\n### 4) Who will validate clinical content
    and logic facilitated through integrations?\n\nYour application may want to segment
    patients based on certain clinical attributes sent in the payload of the HL7 or
    CDA message. For example, you may want your application to send an alert when
    a patient with diabetes is admitted to the hospital. The question, of course,
    is how do you define patients with diabetes? Will they be manually defined by
    clinicians or will you be trying to define them by diagnoses from the admission,
    in their problem list, or by other clinical attributes like High A1C or being
    prescribed insulin?\n\nWhile we can apply some logic to segment patients in our
    interface engine, we do not have clinical informaticists on hand to dictate or
    validate logic that we would create at your behest. The integration engine may
    not be the best place to have that application logic and you may consider those
    mappings and analysis to be IP of your company. You may decide that an organization
    purchasing your digital health product can validate your clinical content (Epic
    did this) or we are happy to refer you to informatics consultants who are qualified
    to assist you.\n\n## Evaluate the Integration's TCO\n\nWith these additional parameters,
    you may want to re-evaluate the [cost to integrate](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-integrations/)
    your digital health product. If you need to hire a niche EHR consultant to build
    an interface on the EHR itself and it costs $5k, can you pass that along to your
    customer or extract that value within your product? If not, you may debate the
    merits of deploying your product in a standalone fashion or adjusting the terms
    of your deal for your customer. If you're new to this, we can help. All [Datica
    Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) customers can engage with Datica for pre-sales
    support to define implementation strategies and to determine feasibility and ease
    of integration at a given site. \n"

  :summary: The FHIR standard is based on API routes but what should the API route
    look like? Learn general design principles and guidelines to build RESTful APIs.
  :post: |-
    FHIR is based on API routes. What should the API route look like? The only legitimate link that a quick Google search produces is the Open Epic link. If you haven't already, I strongly recommend that you sign up [here](http://open.epic.com/).

    Epic has (for now, I'm sure, as they explore the new FHIR world) chosen to define the API structure as below:

    ```
    https://{domain}/{fhir-version}/api/{resourcesName}/{resourceId}
    ```

    This is not their intended production route as it does not address potential issues. Perhaps a good way to arrive at what the final API route might look like, it is worthwhile to list out the data needed to be communicated in the API route and the associated impact on the design of the API route itself. Here is the list of possible parameters:

    - The health system / EHR: This is the domain itself. For example, this would translate to {{domain}} *viz* daticahealth.com
    - The environment (prod / dev / ...):
    - The FHIR version
    - The partner (or should this be better done via an API key?)

    ```
    https://{domain}/fhir/{fhir_version}/{environment}/
    ```

    That will be root or the [base] of all FHIR queries. Additional criteria/parameters will be added on as needed to retrieve the data of interest. For example,

    - The resource
    - The resource ID

    In which case, the `{resourcesName}/{resourceId}` will be tacked on to the end of the root to give us

    ```
    [base]/{resourcesName}/{resourceId}
    ```

    ### General API design principles

    Here are a few design principles that we have adopted based on REST best practices.

    #### 1. Consistency in naming of routes

    Note that we always use the plural form in the API route. This is just a standard way of denoting it. All resource names in the route will always be in the plural and the specific ID will always be in the singular.

    ```
    [base]/{resourcesName}/{resourceId}
    ```

    and with a specific example for the patients resource:

    ```
    [base]/patients/patientID
    ```

    #### 2. Consistency in "VERBS" and "NOUNS"

    In general, there are three sets of routes or "verbs" per "noun" or resource. They all follow the following pattern:

    ##### Actions for POST : /resourcesName/resourceId

    [(Read more about the Resource Object.)](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-fhir-resource-object-the-core-building-block)

    This route will allow you to create and get all resources specific to that user.

    ```
    POST /patients
    ```
    with the associated body will create a patient object. This will also create an internally generated `patientId` and a `createdAt` timestamp. Similarly,

    ```
    POST /patients/6cdf30cc-e81a-4c21-894f-497c5d9ac222/allergies
    ```

    with the associated body will create an allergy object specific to userID `6cdf30cc-e81a-4c21-894f-497c5d9ac222`. This will also create an internally generated `allergyId` and a `createdAt` timestamp.

    **It is important to note that POST actions are unlikely to be supported out of the gate in FHIR implementations but are included in here for completeness.**


    ##### Actions for GET: /resourcesName/resourceId or :/resourcesName?params=value

    This route will allow either a specific resource to be returned or based on the parameters supplied, a list of resources. The only caveat is likely to be a patient specific query where the parameters will be restricted: i.e. only a specific set of parameters will be allowed so prevent random searches along the lines of *give me all patients who's last name is Smith*. We will delve into this more detail when we look at the patient specific route details in a subsequent section.

    ```
    GET /allergies/051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206
    ```

    will return a body with the specific allergy details. In the context of a patient, it is likely that the request being sent must include a minimum set of parameters to return a specific patient rather than a general query as mentioned earlier. A patient query (GET) will look like this:

    ```
    GET /patients?lastName=Smith&gender=male&mrn=88776656
    ```

    which will return a patient resource with associated details as long as there is a specific match. If there is no match, then an empty body will be returned or ideally, would not even trigger a response. This is a potentially useful security precaution to ensure that even null responses do not communicate any information.


    ##### Actions for PUT and DELETE: /resourcesName/resourceId

    This route will allow you to modify or delete specific resource objects.

    ```
    PUT /allergies/051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206
    ```

    with the associated body will update the allergy object with ID `051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206`

    Since allergies always pertain to a unique patient, the same route could be called as

    ```
    PUT /patients/6cdf30cc-e81a-4c21-894f-497c5d9ac222/allergies/051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206
    ```

    Similarly for DELETE,

    ```
    DELETE /allergies/051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206
    ```

    with an empty body will delete the allergy object with ID `051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206` and the equivalent patient oriented route being

    ```
    DELETE /patients/6cdf30cc-e81a-4c21-894f-497c5d9ac222/allergies/051d8c27-b0c4-432d-a75d-1070fd877206
    ```

    Since the allergyId is a unique number, the patientId is overkill but is in there to simplify / rationalize the structure and number of routes you need to remember.

    **Again, it is important to note that PUT and DELETE actions are unlikely to be supported out of the gate in FHIR implementations but are included in here for completeness.**

    #### 3. Limiting which fields are returned by the API

    You won't always need the full representation of a resource. The ability select and chose returned fields allows you to minimize network traffic and speed up usage of the API. Therefore, we use a fields query parameter that takes a comma separated list of fields to include. For example,

    ```
    GET /patients/2f036fb2-80eb-47ee-9d17-b21790f61663?fields=id,name,updatedAt&status=active
    ```

    would retrieve just enough information to display a sorted listing of allergies for that specific patient (the `-` sign sorts results in reverse chronological order).

    #### 4. APIs are rate limited

    To prevent abuse, it is standard practice to add some sort of rate limiting to an API. [RFC 6585](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585) introduced a HTTP status code [429 Too Many Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4) to accommodate this. However, it can be very useful to notify you of your  limits before you actually hit it.

    This is an area that currently lacks standards but has a number of popular conventions using HTTP response headers.
    At a minimum, include the following headers (using Twitter's naming conventions because headers typically don't have mid-word capitalization):

    ```
    X-Rate-Limit-Limit - The number of allowed requests in the current period
    X-Rate-Limit-Remaining - The number of remaining requests in the current period
    X-Rate-Limit-Reset - The number of seconds left in the current period
    ```

    #### 5. Caching - verify on https

    HTTP provides a built-in caching framework. All you have to do is include some additional outbound response headers and do a little validation when you receive some inbound request headers.
    There are 2 approaches: [ETag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) and [Last-Modified](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.29).

    - **ETag**: When generating a request, include an HTTP header ETag containing a hash or checksum of the representation. This value should change whenever the output representation changes. Now, if an inbound HTTP requests contains an If-None-Match header with a matching ETag value, the API should return a 304 Not Modified status code instead of the output representation of the resource.
    - **Last-Modified**: This basically works like to ETag, except that it uses timestamps. The response header Last-Modified contains a timestamp in [RFC 1123](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt) format which is validated against If-Modified-Since. Note that the HTTP spec has had [3 different acceptable date formats](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3) and the server should be prepared to accept any one of them.

    #### 6. Errors

    Just like an HTML error page shows a useful error message to a visitor, an API should provide a useful error message in a known consumable format. The representation of an error should be no
    different than the representation of any resource, just with its own set of fields. The API should always return sensible HTTP status codes.

    API errors typically break down into 2 types:

    - **400 series** status codes for client issues &
    - **500 series** status codes for server issues.

    The API standardizes that all 400 series errors come with consumable JSON error representation. If possible (i.e. if load balancers & reverse proxies can create custom error bodies),
    this should extend to 500 series status codes.

    A JSON error body should provide a few things for the developer a useful error message, like a unique error code that can be looked up for more details in the docs, and possibly a detailed description. JSON output representation for something like this would look like:

    ```
        {
          "code" : 1234,
          "message" : "Something bad happened :(",
          "description" : "More details about the error here"
        }
    ```

    ##### HTTP status codes

    HTTP defines a bunch of meaningful status codes that can be returned from your API. These can be leveraged to help the API consumers route their responses accordingly.

    * `200 OK` - Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. Can also be used for a POST that doesn't result in a creation.
    * `201 Created` - (Not applicable). Response to a POST that results in a creation. Should be combined with a Location header pointing to the location of the new resource
    * `204 No Content` - Response to a successful request that won't be returning a body (like a DELETE request)
    * `304 Not Modified` - Used when HTTP caching headers are in play
    * `400 Bad Request` - The request is malformed, such as if the body does not parse
    * `401 Unauthorized` - When no or invalid authentication details are provided. Also useful to trigger an auth popup if the API is used from a browser
    * `403 Forbidden` - When authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn't have access to the resource
    * `404 Not Found` - When a non-existent resource is requested
    * `405 Method Not Allowed` - When an HTTP method is being requested that isn't allowed for the authenticated user
    * `410 Gone` - Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions
    * `415 Unsupported Media Type` - If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request
    * `422 Unprocessable Entity` - Used for validation errors
    * `429 Too Many Requests` - When a request is rejected due to rate limiting

    #### 7. Result filtering, sorting and searching

    It's best to keep the base resource URLs as lean as possible. Complex result filters, sorting requirements and advanced searching (when restricted to a single type of resource) can all be easily implemented as query parameters on top of the base URL. Let's look at these in more detail:

    - **Filtering**: Use a unique query parameter for each field that implements filtering. For example, when requesting a list of allergies from the /allergies endpoint, you may want to limit these to only those in the `active` state. This could be accomplished with a request like GET /allergies?status=active. Here, status is a query parameter that implements a filter.
    - **Sorting**: Similar to filtering, a generic parameter sort can be used to describe sorting rules. We accommodate complex sorting requirements by letting the sort parameter take in a list of comma separated fields, each with a possible unary negative to imply descending sort order. For example `GET /allergies?sort=-severity` should retrieve a list of allergies in descending order of severity. Similarly, `GET /allergies?sort=-severity,created_at` should retrieve a list of allergies in descending order of severity. Within a specific severity, older allergies are ordered first.
    - **Searching**: When full text search is used as a mechanism of retrieving resource instances for a specific type of resource, it can be exposed on the API as a query parameter on the resource's endpoint. Let's say `q`. Search queries will be passed straight to the search engine and API output will be in the same format as a normal list result.

    Combining these together, we can build queries like:

    - Retrieve all users with recently updated allergies: `GET /allergies?sort=-updatedAt`
    - Retrieve all users with recently updated active allergies: `GET /allergies?status=active&sort=-updatedAt`
    - Retrieve the set of users with highest severity active allergies mentioning the word 'pollen': `GET /allergies?q=pollen&status=active&sort=-severity,createdAt`

    #### 8. Using Contained Resources (Expansion)

    You can use expansion to retrieve particular details about resources in the same response you get when you request a list of users, for instance in a search. This is a perfect example of a contained resource. By using expansion, you avoid the process of retrieving the list and then making additional calls to retrieve details about each item in the list. This is more efficient and helps you avoid running up against the limits of your quota.

    Patients play a central role in many of the responses returned by resources. For example, queries such as allergy searches, medications all return patient-centric responses. You can expand the patient response format so you can access details about each patient without having to make additional patient resource queries on the individual patients in the response. For example, you can query for patients that match some criteria and at the same time ask the Datica API to extend its response format so that it includes additional details about each patient other than those in the default response format.

    ### Summary

    These are the general design principles that we have followed at Datica. These are guidelines based on our experience building RESTful APIs and gathered from multiple other sources. The key underlying principles being consistency and adherence with HTTP standards.

  :post: "First, a quote from the [FHIR website](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/):\n\n> FHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called \"Resources\". These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    FHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts – mobile phone apps, cloud
    communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication in large institutional
    healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nAt the core of FHIR's design is the concept
    of a Resource. Resources are essentially a structured model of a JSON or XML object.
    There are various resource categories, namely:\n\n#### Clinical Resources\nModels
    that describe clinical objects such as Medications, Diagnostics, Observations
    or other General objects.\n\n#### Administrative Resources\nModels that outline
    how clinical resources are attributed (Attribution), or are described (Entities),
    or are used to support workflows (Workflow).\n\n#### Infrastructure Resources\nModels
    that pertain to carrying specific data payloads such as documents, message headers
    specifying source and destinations, and more. Critically, there are four key model
    types described in this category:\n\n* **Composition** — Allows combination of
    multiple resources into a single, complex and more descriptive object.\n* **Query**
    — Defines a structure for requesting data elements via querying and an associated
    structure for returning responses.\n* **Profiles** — Intended to be a self-descriptive
    way to define what models and extensions are supported by the specific implementation
    and the associated models. Also where model extensions can be specified to extend
    other models to support specific needs.\n* **Value Sets** — Addresses one of the
    biggest challenges in healthcare. Different health systems use different value
    sets and the challenge with interoperability has exacerbated because of the differences.
    This model allows each implementation to specify the value sets in use to assure
    semantic interoperability.\n\nPutting these various models together allows for
    the creation of most any clinical condition.\n\n## Structure of any Resource\n\nAll
    resources follow a standard model with content and associated extensions being
    the only thing that changes from resource to resource, meaning while a Patient
    Resource and a Medication Resource both have the same general overall structure,
    the content within each describing the resource will be different and specific
    to that resource.\n\nThe general structure of any resource is as follows:\n\n1.
    **Resource Type** — Identifies the specific resource model i.e. Patient, Medications,
    Allergies, etc.\n2. **Human Readable summary section** — An XHTML section that
    provides a human readable version of the content within the message. Can be considered
    as a backup as well as a verification section.\n3. **Identifier section** — A
    unique identifier URL for each resource identifying to be of a specific type e.g.
    Patient.\n4. **Extension section** — Allows for the definition of any extensions
    that might be required to support specific clinical workflows e.g. clinical trial
    applicability. Can be inserted in any of sections to cover specific use cases
    and workflow needs.\n5. **Contained Resources** — Other resources used in identification
    and transaction processing e.g. message header and the data object corresponding
    to the type identified earlier or images associated with the patient such as an
    avatar.\n6. **Resource content** — The core content of the resource. In the case
    of a patient, it contains all relevant details about that patient such as name,
    address, phone, guardian or other contact info and so on. Each resource has a
    defined data model.\n7. **Tags** — Typical tagging paradigm you're used to. For
    example, Security labels which can include ACLs, workflow specific functions,
    etc. This one is still murky, however, and should be considered under development.\n\nLet's
    take a sample Resource Object and work our way through it. We'll lay out the individual
    sections and describe them, then finally put it all together in real syntax to
    see what the complete resource will look like.\n\nWe'll begin with an example
    Patient Resource.\n\n### Resource Type\n\nEvery resource will start with its name.
    Given the Patient example, it will start with:\n\n~~~javascript\n\"resourceType\":
    \"Patient\"\n~~~\n{: .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\nThis sets the context of the data
    exchange and allows for appropriate parsing and other rules to be invoked.\n\n###
    Human Readable Summary\n\nEvery resource has an associated tabular description
    of the contents of the message, thus making it human readable. The contents of
    this section are in XHTML format and will include all the `\\n` (next line) characters.
    A sample human readable summary included in a patient message could look like
    this:\n\n~~~javascript\n  \"text\": {\n      \"status\": \"generated\",\n      \"div\":
    \"<div>\n    <table> \\n\n      <tbody> \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n          <td>Name</td>
    \ \\n\n          <td>John Samuel <b>Appleseed</b> (\"John\")</td>  \\n\n        </tr>
    \ \\n\n        <tr>  \\n\n          <td>Address</td> \\n\n          <td>1231 Evergreen
    Ave, #30, San Francisco, CA 90002</td>  \\n\n        </tr>  \\n\n        <tr>
    \\n\n          <td>Contacts</td> \\n\n          <td>Home: unknown. Work: (203)
    5555 6473, Name: Bénédicte du Marché. Relationship: Partner. Phone: +33 (237)
    998327</td> \\n\n        </tr> \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n          <td>Gender</td>
    \\n\n          <td>Male</td> \\n\n        </tr> \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n          <td>Birthdate</td>
    \\n\n          <td>1974-12-25</td> \\n\n        </tr> \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n
    \         <td>Marital Status</td> \\n\n          <td>Married</td> \\n\n        </tr>
    \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n          <td>Multiple Birth Count</td> \\n\n          <td>3</td>
    \\n\n        </tr>  \\n\n        <tr> \\n\n          <td>Id</td> \\n\n          <td>MRN:
    12345 (Acme Healthcare)</td> \\n\n        </tr> \\n\n      </tbody> \\n\n    </table>
    \\n\n</div>\"\n    }\n~~~\n{: .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\nWhich could be easily
    parsed and made readable. In this case, the parsed / rendered content would look
    like this:\n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Name</td>\n        <td>John
    Samuel <b>Appleseed</b> (\"John\")</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Address</td>\n
    \       <td>1231 Evergreen Ave, #30, San Francisco, CA 90002</td>\n      </tr>\n
    \     <tr>\n        <td>Contacts</td>\n        <td>Home: unknown. Work: (203)
    5555 6473, Name: Bénédicte du Marché. Relationship: Partner. Phone: +33 (237)
    998327</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Gender</td>\n        <td>Male</td>\n
    \     </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Birthdate</td>\n        <td>1974-12-25</td>\n
    \     </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Marital Status</td>\n        <td>Married</td>\n
    \     </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Multiple Birth Count</td>\n        <td>3</td>\n
    \     </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Id</td>\n        <td>MRN: 12345 (Acme Healthcare)</td>\n
    \     </tr>\n    </tbody>\n </table>\n\nThe intent of this section is borrowed
    from the HL7 spec. The human readable version of the FHIR content serves two purposes:\n\n1.
    Testing from a developer perspective is simplified as the developer now knows
    exactly what the message / transaction is *supposed* to communicate.\n2. Overcoming
    errors in processing so even if the message gets garbled in processing, the human
    readable version is always available as a fallback for clinicians and others performing
    care.\n\nNote that this narrative element in a resource is **not** mandatory.
    If you have do put one in, it **shall** reflect all the content needed for a human
    to understand the essential clinical and business information otherwise encoded
    within the resource. Note also that this generally will be difficult to generate.
    Epic, for example, has chosen to [drop this section](http://open.epic.com/Clinical/FHIR?whereTo=patient)
    from their spec for the time being. We expect a similar trend across various EHRs
    so practical deployments can (for the time being) safely skip this.\n\n## Identifier
    section\n\nIn FHIR, every object is expected to have its own URI (universal resource
    identifier). All this implies is that every patient, in our context, will have
    their own URI, and potentially URL, with a unique identifier. Identifiers could
    include SSN (social security numbers), MRNs (medical record numbers), and any
    number of others. Multiple identifiers can be specified since it is defined as
    an array. In our context, this would look like the following.\n\n~~~javascript\n\"identifier\":
    [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"label\": \"MRN\",\n      \"system\":
    \"urn:oid:1.2.36.146.595.217.0.1\",\n      \"value\": \"12345\",\n      \"period\":
    {\n        \"start\": \"2001-05-06\"\n      },\n      \"assigner\": {\n        \"display\":
    \"Acme Healthcare\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n\n~~~\n{: .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\n##
    Extensions\n\nThis is healthcare after all. There are a million use cases that
    you can think of that requires \"slightly\" different definitions that what is
    already provided. Not to mention that since FHIR is supposed to be a **universal**
    standard, all of these must be taken into account as well. Hence the need for
    extensions.\n\nExtensions can be tacked on to any Resource Object as long as they
    follow a specified format. The general format specified is as follows:\n\n~~~javascript\n\"name\"
    : {\n  \"extension: [\n    {\n      \"url\" : \"https://{{url.defining.extension-profile.com/id}}\",\n
    \     \"valueCode\" : \"{{value}}\"\n     }]\n  \"text\": \"{{human readable value
    - this is optional}}\"/>\n}\n~~~\n{: .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\nLet's take a couple
    of use cases.\n\n### Marital Status\n\n~~~javascript\n\"_maritalStatus\": {\"extension\":
    [{\n      \"valueCode\": \"Common-law\",\n      \"url\": \"http://fhir-endpoint.someorg.com/fhir/version1.0/marriage-extension#cl\"\n
    \ }]}\n~~~\n{: .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\n### Clinical Trials\n\nHere's another
    extremely relevant example of a patient resource where you can see an extension
    specific to a clinical trial, including data elements such as trial status, profile
    with the trial status code, date, and the physician recording the results of the
    study.\n\n~~~javascript\n  \"resource-type\" : \"Patient\",\n  \"extension\" :
    [\n    {\n      \"url\" : \"http://fhir-endpoint.someorg.com/fhir/version1.0/Profile/clinical-trails#trial-status\",\n
    \     \"extension\" : [\n        {\n          \"url\" : \"http://fhir-endpoint.someorg.com/fhir/version1.0/Profile/clinical-trails#trial-status#trial-status-code\",\n
    \         \"valueCode\" : \"Started\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"url\"
    : \"http://fhir-endpoint.someorg.com/fhir/version1.0/Profile/clinical-trails#trial-status#trial-status-date\",\n
    \         \"valueDate\" : \"2015-02-26\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"url\"
    : \"http://fhir-endpoint.someorg.com/fhir/version1.0/Profile/clinical-trails#trial-status#trial-status-who\",\n
    \         \"valueResource\" : {\n            \"reference\" : \"Practitioner/f6dbc2f3-d054-4dd7-84c1-5e675f8e50d7\"\n
    \         }\n        }\n     ]\n   }\n  ],\n  // ... other data for patient...\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\n## Contained Resources\n\nSince FHIR is a request-based
    format, contained resources are a way to minimize the number of calls to address
    use cases where specific data elements need to be served up every time a request
    is made to a particular resource. An example would be if a patient avatar picture
    needs to be served up anytime a patient resource is returned. Note that this assumed
    that the request is valid and the request is authenticated and authorized before
    the response is served.\n\nIn this specific scenario, if the patient avatar image
    always has to be sent along with any patient resource request, then it would look
    something like this:\n\n~~~javascript\n  \"contained\": [\n      {\n          \"resourceType\":
    \"Binary\",\n          \"id\": \"pic1\",\n          \"contentType\": \"image/gif\",\n

    Every resource has a model associated with it that is different based upon the
    resource type in question. As you can imagine, in the context of a patient, the
    kind of information that needs to be shared includes date of birth, contact information,
    next of kin, address info etc. The sample below is pretty self explanatory.\n\n~~~javascript\n

    a required component.\n* **Human Readable summary section** — An XHTML section
    that provides a human readable version of the content within the message. This

    unless you can ensure all data contained in the message is also represented here.
    It is an optional component.\n* **Extension section** — Allows for the definition
    of any extensions that might be required to support specific clinical workflows
    e.g. clinical trial applicability. This can be inserted in any of the sections
    to cover specific use cases and workflow needs. This is required if resources
    include data elements / objects that are not part of the core FHIR models.\n*
    **Contained Resources** — Other resources used in identification and transaction
    processing e.g. message header and the data object corresponding to the type identified
    earlier, such as images, that always need to be returned as part of the resource
    request. This is an optional element.\n* **Metadata** — Such as version number
    of the resource. This is an optional element.\n* **Resource content** — The core
    content of the resource. In the case of a patient, all relevant details about
    that patient such as name, address, phone, guardian or other contact info and
    so on. Each resource has a defined data model. This is a required element (otherwise
    why bother?).\n* **Tags** — Such as security labels which can include ACLs, workflow
    specific functions, etc. This is optional. It is also under design.\n\nWhile the
    FHIR spec is stabilizing, no doubt additions and subtractions are on the horizon.
    Stay tuned for updates.\n"

    ### Why FHIR?

    The current state-of-the-art in healthcare integration and interoperability is based on HL7, and is a serious mess. Organizations today spend upwards of $5000 to $10,000 per HL7 interface, not to mention serious licensing fees to implement and use integration engines. All of which raise the interesting question of, "Wait, if they are all based on a standard, why do I need an integration engine?" For two reasons:

    1. HL7 is a standard but it is not an **open** standard. You need to be a member of the HL7 organization and pay  fees before using the content in any commercial fashion.
    2. HL7 is an ancient standard: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7) notes that it was developed in the late 80s when a lot of things we take for granted now didn't exist - mobile numbers, emails, NPI (national provider identifiers), APIs...

    What resulted was a lot of "I'll just do it **this** way", causing an explosion of HL7 variants. This, in turn, led to the need for interface engines where additional logic needs to be coded to accommodate those *"this-way"* variants and other healthcare specific use cases. That led to the bigger problem that integration and logic is now embedded into the data transformation process. Change your source system (upgrade, replace, etc.) and your integration falls apart. Need more data than you're currently getting, well, it's back to the integration engine again. Oh, by the way, there is no concept of CI / CD (continuous integration, continuous deployment) in the context of integration engines. Often developers make changes in production directly, which is also why healthcare institutions are very cautious about providing access to systems sending data to any external system, no matter the value. And for good reason, as you can imagine.

    #### A better, more modern approach to integration and interoperability

    FHIR has an ambitious goal. Integration capabilities should be built into the EHR itself along with the other aspects of authentication and security. Over time, this will eliminate the need for expensive integration projects and licenses. Additionally, the use of modern concepts such as [RESTful APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and accompanying documentation will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and get the data needed. From a design perspective, the general principle is that since healthcare is complicated, creating a standard set of models which are transactional in nature (like HL7) has been shown to be problematic. Therefore, creating core models (like patients, for example), having standardized data models around those core elements, and ensuring that most, if not all, use cases can be addressed by allowing requests to be **composed** as needed.

    Given the above, FHIR does offer many improvements over existing standards:

    - **It's open source**: This is a big deal and the first effort in making healthcare integration more transparent and accessible. Putting it out in the open has created a significant community including developers, vendors and enterprises.
    - **RESTful**: REST-based design brings a significant amount of benefit, namely that an API that adheres to the principles of REST does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the API. Rather, the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the service.
    - **Extensible**: Extensibility under the RESTful context ensures that additions can be easily tacked on to cover specific use cases without impacting the core models.
    - **Composable**: Composability ensures that almost any request can be cobbled together using core models or resources and associated extensions.
    - **Good documentation**: Uniquely driven by the RESTful API approach, which enforces good documentation as a byproduct. A playable version of the FHIR APIs would be a nice to have and is something that we, at Datica, intend to provide as part of this documentation.
    - **Support for modern web standards**: XML, JSON, HTTP, Atom, OAuth, REST - these are the underlying technologies that FHIR leverages. These are battle tested and have been proven at scale and under significant security requirements.

    #### Flexibility without modifying underlying systems or integration engines

    As described earlier, various healthcare workflows (e.g. z-segments in HL7) that forced extensions of standards is one of the biggest challenges with older integrations. Underlying systems required code changes to generate specific datasets and additional work on the integration engine to support the data processing. All this made it very cumbersome to create and manage integrations with any changes in the underlying source systems (e.g. upgrades etc.), causing a significant amount of rework.

    FHIR addresses this by:

    - **Focusing on ease of implementation**: Implementation is very different from most standards where the focus is typically more on coverage and data models. FHIR is interesting because the focus has been on ease of implementation from the beginning, including backwards compatibility. Multiple implementation libraries have also been provided in Java and .NET, among others, along with many examples to kick-start development. The website claims "multiple developers had simple interfaces working in a single day", which is unheard of in healthcare.
    - **Easy extensibility**: FHIR solves extensibility challenges by defining a simple framework for extending and adapting the existing resources. All systems, no matter how they are developed, can easily read these extensions and extension definitions can be retrieved using the same framework as retrieving other resources.
    - **Human readability**: HL7 3.0 had a concept of a human readable version of the document / data being shared to ensure that developers or clinicians could still read the source data to eliminate any potential of misconfiguration or coding errors. FHIR borrows this concept as well. Every resource carries a human-readable text representation using html as a fallback display option. This is particularly important for complex clinical information where many systems take a simple textual/document based approach.

    ### Advantages over existing standards, e.g. HL7

    - **Pipe delimited vs. JSON, XML...**: No further discussion is required. This approach makes it more easily usable, understandable and testable.
    - **Security**: HL7 as a protocol doesn't have security and authentication built into it. To be fair, HL7 was always meant to enable intra-system communication, like between lab systems and an EHR. All of which were within a health system's firewalls. Therefore authentication wasn't really needed. The evolution of healthcare has made care delivery more dispersed, which is why HL7 is beginning to show it's gaps. FHIR leverages (or is in the process of defining) modern https based authentication and authorization capabilities such as OAuth, which are prevalent in the modern web and have been battle tested over the years.
    - **Flexible and composable**: The FHIR design allows developers to combine requests to create any interface or extend resources (with associated definition) and "tack" them onto pre-defined resource models. [(More on the Resource Object here.)](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-fhir-resource-object-the-core-building-block) No coding up the underlying systems or touching interface engines required.

    ### Status and challenges

    FHIR is still a work in progress. It does have a few advantages.

    #### Significant industry support

    Individual developers and other organizations have contributed sample implementations, like [HAPI-FHIR](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/) and many more. Plus a significant group of enterprises have come together under the auspices of HL7 with the moniker of "Argonaut Project". This group includes EHR vendors and health systems such as
    - athenahealth
    - Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
    - Cerner
    - Epic
    - Intermountain Healthcare
    - Mayo Clinic
    - Meditech
    - McKesson
    - Partners HealthCare System
    - SMART at the Boston Children’s Hospital Informatics Program
    - The Advisory Board Company

    #### It's a work in progress

    Despite significant industry support, it is unlikely widespread implementations of FHIR will be seen until the 2016-2017 timeframe because definitions and specifications are still in progress, implementations are still underway and more EHR software changes are likely required.

    #### Security is still an open item

    Security with FHIR is incomplete. Authentication before Authorization or vice versa? Conformance and associated profiles per link? Is there to be an API route to call to verify that? Is that route open to everyone?

    #### Not real-time

    Currently the biggest gap, FHIR is not a real-time protocol. In contrast, HL7 was always a real-time protocol. If someone was admitted to the hospital, all relevant parties were notified immediately via ADT.

    FHIR is currently still a request based protocol. You ask if you need to know something such as _"Was this person admitted to the hospital?"_, which makes sense from a patient app perspective, but not so much from a workflow perspective. Webhooks are optional additions, but begs the question _"Why can't we just FHIR enable HL7?"_ The Datica answer is, _"Yes, indeed. It should."_

    #### Granular resource model can become request intensive

    ADT (and other HL7) messages were crafted with care to support hospital and ancillary system workflows. The flexibility and composability (described in the advantages section above) come at a cost. To get all the data that one normally expects from an ADT message would require a "bundle" of FHIR resources. This could get complicated and request-intensive quickly.

    ### Summary

    Overall, FHIR has a lot going for it. There are gaps but they are neither unexpected nor insurmountable. Stay tuned for updates as the FHIR standard evolves.

  :summary: HL7 is a healthcare industry standard for messaging between applications,
    for example from EHR to PMS. Learn HL7 basics, including HL7 v2 and v3.
  :lead: 'Health Level Seven (HL7) is a standard utilized by the healthcare industry
    to enable messaging between applications, EHR to PMS (practice management system)
    for example. It is managed and maintained by [Health Level Seven International
    (HL7)](http://hl7.org) which is a not-for-profit, ANSI-accredited standards developing
    organization. '
  :post: |
    The HL7 standard is often jokingly referred to as the “non-standard standard.” This is not very fair but it does reflect the fact that almost every hospital, clinic, imaging center, lab, and care facility is “special” in terms of how it implements HL7 (really?, why?). The reason is primarily because there is no such thing as a standard business or clinical process for interacting with patients, clinical data, or related personnel.

    The HL7 messaging protocol was designed to facilitate high volumes of pre-defined data to be shared across many applications reliably. The protocol selected to make this happen was a traditional file transfer or a TCP/IP **socket** in both a real-time and batched fashion. HL7 v2 message structure is complex, flat, and delimited. HL7 has obviously evolved over time. The current version of HL7 is v3, however, older versions exist and make up the bulk of the standard used today primarily because of the large number customizations that have been done to each HL7 message.

    #### The key differences between an HL7 v2 and HL7 v3 message are as follows:

    1. v2.x was primarily meant for clinical communications - medical orders, patient registration etc. whereas v3.x has additional features for use by informaticists and for government reporting requirements.
    2. v2.x was a custom format (barebones text - all coded and separated by a pipe with headers and multiple segments etc.) v2.x looks like this:

    ![academy-hl7protocol](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/612KI64BeokOUW82m0w0oc/f4b03fd55891221f038ed0e8ad1c1521/academy-hl7protocol.png)

    whereas an HL7 v3.0 message is an XML format (I'm not sure if that's an improvement) - very verbose and detailed - like this:

    ![academy-hl7syntax](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/Ea7Dy1f3CCGWM4uWEwsWK/7ac35d657e029cf8c71aa8dfaa33bef1/academy-hl7syntax.png)

    3. All v2.x formats are backward compatible. v3.x is a wholly separate format and not backwards compatible.

    Any technology solution in healthcare has to support both v2.x and v3.x formats. Open source parsing solutions exist to help with processing HL7 (see section below on Parsing HL7 messages). However, in this author's humble opinion, the 3.x standards are unlikely to be implemented given the investments already made in the 2.x versions. The [FHIR](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/) standards, which are still under active development, are more likely to be implemented rather than the v3.0 standards. See this Figure for some data supporting this hypothesis. (source: Corepoint)

    ![academy-figure1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2CnbugFEHqQ0SWymeeEWGK/33f4cac50b16d3845ddaf11f32d0a36c/academy-figure1.png)

    ### Customization

    Every conversation that you've ever overheard about HL7 usually includes customizations to be accounted for and associated implementation costs. When I was starting in this space, I heard the same things but wasn't really sure what it meant.

    So here's a summary of what I've learned. I will caveat this by saying that I am not an HL7 expert - there are folks out there who have much more extensive experience than I do; [Keith Boone](http://motorcycleguy.blogspot.com/) for one, whose blog is worth subscribing to if you have any interest in healthcare standards for one. Given that I'm not an expert, if you see any errors in this document, please let me know (and also let us know if you're looking for an interesting change in [careers](mailto:jobs@catalyze.io)).

    More about custom formats... HL7 messages are indeed customized but this does not imply, as an example, that every ADT (admission, discharge, transfer) message is different between different hospitals; ADT is ubiquitous so it's an HL7 message type you should know. Customization came about when certain message types, like ADT, could not support sending all the data elements that needed to be sent. For example, a message might be able to handle only 50 data elements but an EKG reading might need to send over 200. The extra data elements were then sent over using the notorious Z segment - a miscellaneous segment into which pretty much any key value pair could be jammed in. This custom blob of data in the Z segment would then need to be parsed and mapped etc. for automated processing and use, creating impressive levels of customization in data exchange.

    Before you get too excited, the true customization comes in the form of the content of the HL7 message. The HL7 organization has defined code sets to be used to translate the terse codes sent over within the HL7 message. See [here](https://www.impactportal.info/emrCodeSet.asp?SID=4) for a listing of some v2.3 code sets or [here](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) for a more comprehensive listing from the "horse's mouth." The purpose of the code sets, as you can imagine, is to codify the content to reduce the size of the message. ANT, as an example, stands for Anterior in the context of body sites and so on. And, by the way, these code sets for HL7 have also evolved / been added to / modified with each version of HL7. However, these code sets, which are released and maintained as part of the standard, aren't often adhered to. EHRs (usually) and hospitals have defined their own code sets. So the content sent over within the HL7 message needs to be "looked up" against that specific code set before it can be made useful. An Epic code set is unique (although common across Epic deployments) and different from an AllScripts code set. This is the uniqueness that must be addressed by any solution in this space and the reason why HL7 implementations can sometimes be expensive - they need to take into account not only the Z segments and map them to the appropriate data models but the code sets have to be taken into account as well.

    So, in practice, HL7 can be perhaps best described as a messaging protocol and format standard in most implementations rather than as a comprehensive messaging standard.

    ### HL7 Message Types (most common)

    There are more than 80 message types, a whole host of segments and codes for pretty much anything you can think of. See [this](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) document for a pretty comprehensive listing. But the following are the most common HL7 message types:

    |Message Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |ACK|General acknowledgement message. This is the ack sent when a message is received by the destination system. ACKs are automated responses. However, you could use ACKs as a way to modulate the speed at which messages come through as the sending system will not send the next message until the ACK is received|
    |ADT|Admission, Discharge and Transfer message. Created whenever a patient goes through any of those states. There are a whole list of these possible states. See below for a sampling of a few more|
    |ORM|Pharmacy/treatment order message|
    |ORU|Observation message (unsolicited). Unsolicited because the destination systems are not asking for it, it is fired off and the source systems will take it in and process it if needed or discard it if not.|
    |BAR|Add or change the billing account.|
    |SIU|Schedule information (unsolicited) usually patient specific. This is used to create, modify and delete patient appointments and other schedules.|
    |MDM|Medical document management. This often acts as a workhorse. It is meant to handle documents like notes, reports etc. But often is used to capture a whole host of other data for which there is no easy mapping. In which case, the incoming data gets converted into a PDF and pushed into the EHR via this MDM message|
    |DFT|Detailed financial transactions. This data is used to capture the details of procedures etc. so that claims can be generated.|
    |MFN|Master files notification - changes to core data elements are sent through this.|
    |QRY|Query - as the name implies is used to query source systems for data on things like patient demographics etc.|
    |RAS|Pharmacy/treatment administration message|
    |RDE|Pharmacy/treatment encoded order message|
    |RGV|Pharmacy/treatment give message|

    ​It should also be noted that each of these message types have different types (sub-types) as well. For example, there are 51 (yep, that's right) different types of ADT messages that are used for various trigger events. Some of the most commonly used ADT messages include:

    - ADT-A01 – patient admit

    - ADT-A02 – patient transfer

    - ADT-A03 – patient discharge

    - ADT-A04 – patient registration

    - ADT-A05 – patient pre-admission

    - ADT-A08 – patient information update

    - ADT-A11 – cancel patient admit

    - ADT-A12 – cancel patient transfer

    - ADT-A13 – cancel patient discharge

    The important thing to remember is that the content of the message doesn't change all that much between all these sub-types. The message is still about the specific patient (PID segment - see segment section below).

    ### HL7 Segments

    A segment is a group of fields that then contain different types of data. Each segment exists independently and can be utilized in multiple messages, in different sequences. Segments may be required for a particular message or in other cases, they may be optional.

    A unique three-character code called the "Segment ID" identifies each segment. Segment ID codes beginning with the letter Z are reserved for the "custom" Z-segments (key value pairs) that are not part of the HL7 standard.

    You can remove one or more segments from a message if desired. But because HL7 rules state that unexpected or unused segments should be ignored, most systems will ignore the unexpected segments without issue (therefore, manually removing these segments is unnecessary). Segments should be removed only if one of the receiving systems will not have problems when unexpected segments are received.

    These are the most common segment types that will be used across multiple message types.

    |Segment Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |DG1|Diagnosis|
    |EVN|Event type|
    |GT1|Guarantor|
    |IN1|>Insurance|
    |MSH|Message header|
    |NTE|Notes and comments|
    |OBRI|Observation Request|
    |OBXI|Observation Result|
    |ORCI|Common Order|
    |PID|Patient Identification|
    |FT1|For DFT messages - Financial transactions|

    At a high level, that's HL7. Look for further articles delving into more details on HL7 message structures and the common message types.

  :summary: This deep dive explains HL7 message types, message structure, message
    segments, codes, fields and the complete anatomy of an HL7 message.
  :post: |
    In the [previous entry](/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/), we gave you a quick introduction to HL7 and its design - message types, segments and code sets. What I've come to also appreciate as I delved deeper into HL7 is that for all its perceived faults, it has more than served its purpose of standardization of communication of clinical and administrative data amongst disparate applications.

    One can argue about problems arising because of the lack of standardization of code sets and cross-enterprise communication, but one also has to appreciate that this standard is a couple of decades old when inter-enterprise communication was not something at the top of anyone's mind. Heck, EHR implementations were rare too. Expecting HL7, which was designed and developed by consensus to address something far more tactical, to also  address the challenges of comprehensive interoperability, is asking a lot of HL7.

    With that said, in this post, we'll delve deeper into HL7 so that you can better understand how an HL7 message is constructed.

    ### The overall structure of an HL7 message

    Think of an HL7 message as an envelope. It contains various segments (pieces of data) which are (usually) patient oriented and triggered based on specific events (admits, lab results, procedures, discharge etc.) and communicate relevant information about that triggered event.

    There are a lot of message types - 76 in v2.3 and 85 in v2.3.1 and even more now. The key ones to remember were also listed in my [previous entry](/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/). An HL7 message is constructed with:

    - **One or more segments**: Segments are re-usable sub-parts of a message which contain the pertinent information related to that message type. So for example, an Admit message would contain information on the patient and her demographics, the reason for admission, the attending physician who signed off on the admit etc. And as you can imagine, patient demographics is reused in a lot of places and is a segment. There are a lot of segments (101 in v2.3 and 111 in v2.3.1) to cover almost any use case you can think of - from financial transactions (DFT) to Bed Status Updates (NPU).

    - **Fields & Code sets**: Each segment consists of one or more fields of data. Since the message needs to be as short as possible, the fields are encoded using standardized codes (provided by HL7 or other bodies) or user defined (ideally only if HL7 doesn't recommend any or you need to communicate more than permitted). Message Header becomes MSH, patient demographics becomes PD1 and Male becomes M. There are lot of additional codes to cover all the various kinds of information that need to be communicated - 1691 codes in v2.3 not including any user defined codes.

    - and **Control characters**: These are the ASCII characters used to separate data elements (|), indicate spaces or new lines (^) and the beginning of the next segment (the CR or carriage return). These are a subset of the control characters but some of the more important ones.

    In order to ensure that the receiving system knows how to parse the incoming message, some rules are laid down in that define

    - **For each message**, the required or optional segments and the number of times a segment could be repeated within. An example from the HL7 v2.3 standard is shown below. (image: samplehl7.png) (*source - HL7 v2.3 implementation guide*)

    - **For each segment**, the sequence (SEQ) in which fields are expected, their length (LEN), the data types (DT), if the fields are required or optional (R/O), if they are repeatable or not and how many times can they be repeated (RP/#) and the table in which the code sets are defined. This is a "mapping table." An example of which is shown below. (image: hl7chart.png) (*source - HL7 v2.3 implementation guide*).

    Both of these rules are used for validation of any inbound message but the code sets are not. You can now see how the HL7 standard could be bastardized:

    - Code set doesn't cover all my needs: So you add one more to the list that HL7 provides. Now your HL7 standard is not quite a standard and cannot be shared with another entity unless they implement your code set as well

    - Field repetitions allowed is insufficient: I want to send an EKG reading but the standard only allows for 50 repetitions of key value pairs. So I dump the rest into the Z segment and shoot it over that way. Now your HL7 message can be processed by any engine **but** the content inside the Z segment now has to be parsed and managed separately.

    A quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to contain a bunch of [],{} etc. The general rule is as follows:
    - No brackets around it - **Required**
    - [] - **Optional**
    - { } - **Repeating**
    - [{ }] - **Optional Repeating**

    The ORM message structure is as follows.
    ```
    ORM     General Order Message
    MSH     Message Header
     [{NTE}]    Notes and Comments (for Header)
    [
       PID     Patient Identification
       [PD1]    Additional Patient Identification
          [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments (for Patient ID)
       [PV1    Patient Visit
        [PV2|]   Patient Visit Additional Information
        [{IN1   Insurance
          [IN2]   Insurance Additional Info
       [IN3]   Insurance Additional Info
        }]
        [GT1]   Guarantor
        [{AL1}]   Allergy
      ]
    ]
     {
       ORC    Common Order
      [
       Order Detail Segment OBR, etc.
           [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments (for Detail)
           [{DG1}]  Diagnosis
           [
            {
             OBX   Observation/Result
                  [{NTE}] Notes and Comments (for Results)
             }
           ]
      ]
      {[CTI]}   Clinical Trial Identification
     [BLG]    Billing segment
     }
    ```


    Hope that gave you a deeper insight into HL7. In the next post, we'll take an actual HL7 message - the ADT - and break it down to help you understand how it's constructed exactly.

    examples - it's just that the 2.3 and 2.3.1 standards are the most widely implemented
    standard accounting for well over 80% of deployments. So if you know these two
    well, you're in pretty good shape. Additionally, except for v3.0, all subsequent
    HL7 versions are backwards compatible. What you can expect from later versions
    is more message types, more segments and more codes - and some being retired,
    of course.\n\nI've always felt that the best way to learn is by doing. So, we'll
    start with a message that we want to send and see how we can encode and construct
    that message in HL7.\n\n### The message to be sent\nAs another side note, the
    examples we'll use throughout will be inpatient oriented as outpatient HL7 messages
    are identical in nature and simpler to boot. Let's take the simple case of an
    admission into a hospital. In the case of an admit - you would need to know the
    name of the patient and some demographics like date or birth, gender, any next
    of kin and their info in case there are any significant problems, an identifier
    like an MRN, where they were admitted into (room, bed), who was the attending
    physician who signed off on the admit, and the reason for the admit. So the message
    you would want to perhaps send from an ADT system to say a Lab system could be
    (in plain English) - \"Patient (John A Appleseed) was admitted on Jan 1, 2013
    at 12:23 a.m. by Dr Sidney J. Good (#004777) for surgery. He has been assigned
    to room 2012, bed 01 on nursing unit 2000.\"\n\nOne thing, we can know immediately
    looking at the table above that this would be an ADT-A01 message.\n\n### The mandated
    structure of the ADT-A01 message\n\nAs we discussed in [the earlier HL7 102: Anatomy
    of an HL7 message post](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-102-anatomy-of-an-hl7-message/),
    HL7 recommends / mandates that messages follow a specific structure. For the ADT-A01
    message type, the structure is as shown in the image below. \n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/iIS9zbOYmsAI6qcuW6sW4/f8b1eb7c079f09cb417590d46889ba23/academy-sample-hl7-message-sequence.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-sample-hl7-message-sequence\" />\n\n(*source
    - HL7 v2.3 implementation guide*). Looking at the structure, we can guess that
    the segments we will need are:\n\n- MSH: the message header (required everywhere)\n-
    EVN: indicating the event that happened (in this case the admission of the patient)\n-
    PID: the patient identification segment. Note that demographics can be included
    within the PID segment itself\n- NK1: next of kin (which is always good to know
    in a hospital context in case something goes wrong)\n- PV1: information about
    the patient \"visit\" - this is where you would include the physician info and
    the current location of the patient.\n- Since an image is worth a thousand words,
    I'll try and illustrate the process using images rather than a lot of words. I'm
    not going to give you the mapping tables etc. as I'm pretty sure the HL7 licensing
    agreements might prohibit sharing outside our org.\n\nIt's easily downloadable
    from the [HL7](http://www.hl7.org) website. One quick tip before we begin - in
    most HL7 messages the pipe character `|` is called the BAR and it is the field
    separator and in the case of this message, we're going to use the `^` as a space.
    So if you see a bunch of pipes together like this `||||||||||` - all that means
    is that the fields at that point in the sequence were optional or not available.
    Also remember that segments are separated by a carriage return - which cannot
    be displayed as any and all viewers will interpret that for display.\n\n#### The
    MSH segment\nIf you wanted to mail someone an important letter, you need to specify
    the from and to addresses and you may sign up for delivery confirmation. That
    corresponds almost exactly to the first and common segment across all HL7 messages
    - the MSH (message header) segment. The figure below shows the needed fields that
    need to be populated in an MSH segment and the values filled in for those fields.
    We've also assumed here that the system sending the update is an Epic ADT system
    and it's being sent to a Lab system.\n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/7giNk2Hp4IgmkGEaaoyU0/3439f88cb3a6e62dc208c0ef819deb2c/academy-msh-segment.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-msh-segment\" />\n\nNow, if we lookup
    the mapping tables, we can easily fill in the MSH segment with information (after
    coding it appropriately) to get the following HL7 encoded MSH message segment.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|EPICADT|DH|LABADT|DH|201301011226||ADT^A01|HL7MSG00001|P|2.3|\n```\n\n####
    The EVN segment\nSimilarly in the case of the EVN segment, the figure below shows
    the data needed and the data we have.\n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1WjUfO7KaAs66mKkQukuEI/08268698bea9d209874281ce0adfeb60/academy-evn-message-segment.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-evn-message-segment\" />\n\nFollowing
    the same process of looking up the mapping tables and encoding, gives us this
    HL7 encoded EVN message segment\n\n```\nEVN|A01|201301011223||\n```\n\n#### The
    PID segment\nThe PID segment contains more info such as the full name of the patient
    etc. Which requires the use of a space and newlines. This is where the other control
    characters come into play, namely the \"^\" symbol. What we need to send, and
    the data we have, are as follows:\n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/13G8LaFtVoAiEgSwAo6EAs/f7c91e444124159a1560395f63f157bc/academy-pid-message-segment.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-pid-message-segment\" />\n\nAnd following
    the process above and encoding the data (in this case for example, \"male\" becomes
    \"M\"), we get the following encoded segment.\n\n```\nPID|||MRN12345^5^M11||APPLESEED^JOHN^A^III||19710101|M||C|1^DATICA
    STREET^^MADISON^WI^53005-1020|GL|(414)379-1212|(414)271-3434||S||MRN12345001^2^M10|123456789|987654^NC|\n```\n\n####
    The NK1 segment\nWhat we need to send and what we have is this:\n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/2B6z9MvyrKeusy0SmEm4u6/7db8f7be80172f3a3f5b078928e411fa/academy-nk1-message-segment.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-nk1-message-segment\" />\n\nAnd we get
    this:\n\n```\nNK1|1|APPLESEED^BARBARA^J|WIFE||||||NK^NEXT OF KIN\n```\n\n####
    The PV1 segment\n\nThis:\n\n<img data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5heHePcuYEKe8GmEIccGCg/0d73ad3149934718af15f6807579a95a/academy-pv1-message-segment.png?w=760\"
    class=\"lozad img-crisp\" alt=\"academy-pv1-message-segment\" />\n\nAnd we get
    this:\n\n```\nPV1|1|I|2000^2012^01||||004777^GOOD^SIDNEY^J.|||SUR||||ADM|A0|\n```\n\n###
    Putting it all together\nNow that we've generated the individual segments, we
    need to put them together. In the earlier section on message structure, you'd
    have seen the required sequence to be followed. So - we do that and voila! - the
    full HL7 ADT-A01 message (without the carriage returns)\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|EPICADT|DH|LABADT|DH|201301011226||ADT^A01|HL7MSG00001|P|2.3|\nEVN|A01|201301011223||\nPID|||MRN12345^5^M11||APPLESEED^JOHN^A^III||19710101|M||C|1

    isn't it? Well, the good thing is that there are open source parsers that can
    do this for you. We'll delve into those and I'll give you as comprehensive a listing
    of those as I can find with some pro / cons as well. We're also building out hosted
    versions of HL7 parsers with what we see as key enhancements over what is currently
    available. Stay tuned for announcements about those.\n\nIf you’re looking to integrate

  :summary: The HL7 acknowledgement message, HL7 ACK, is critical for smooth, ongoing
    HL7 communication. Learn the nuances of HL7 ACK messages, segments, and codes.
  :lead: The HL7 acknowledgement message, or ACK, is critical to ensure that ongoing
    HL7 communication proceeds smoothly. The concept of an [ACK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks))
    is commonly used in many data networks protocols, including TCP, so you are likely
    familiar with it. Although conceptually simple (receiving system acknowledges
    receipt for specific message sent from sending system), there are a couple of
    nuances (enhanced mode, rate limiting) with HL7 ACK that make covering this topic
    worthwhile.
  :post: "## The structure of an ACK message\n\nLet's take a quick look at how an
    ACK message is created.\n\nLet's say an inbound HL7 ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer)
    message came in with the following MSH (message header).\n\n~~~\nMSH|^~\\&|EPICADT|DH|LABADT|DH|201301011226||ADT^A01|HL7MSG00001|P|2.3|\n~~~\n\nIf
    the message was accepted and acknowledged, then the response ACK message (following
    original mode) will look like this:\n\n~~~\nMSH|^~\\&|LABADT|DH|EPICADT|DH|201301011228||ACK^A01^ACK
    |HL7ACK00001|P|2.3\nMSA|AA|HL7MSG00001\n~~~\n\nNote the following:\n\n1. The source
    and destination systems have been switched;\n2. MSA segment contains the \"AA\"
    value which indicates acceptance; and\n3. MSA segment also contains the ID of
    the original message.\n\nSeems pretty straightforward but as you will see, the
    rules utilized to come up with this simple message can be pretty complicated.\n\n##
    The need for the ACK message\n\nThe need for acknowledgements is best understood
    when we know that:\n\n1. HL7 is designed around the concept of trigger events
    - i.e. someone got admitted, a lab test has to be ordered, lab test results have
    been received, patient has to be rescheduled etc.\n2. Healthcare IT systems are
    very \"specialized\" - there are systems (often from different vendors) that focus
    just on ADT (admission, discharges and transfers), practice management (patient
    scheduling and billing), labs (lab orders, results capture and communication)
    etc.\n\nSo, if an event happens in one system (patient is admitted), then that
    event has to be sent to another system (e.g. labs) to communicate information
    such as internal patient identifiers (otherwise how will the lab know if the incoming
    order is for a valid patient or not, what identifier to use etc.). Note that these
    messages are usually unsolicited - i.e. ADT message is sent to all interested
    systems as soon as it happens without being asked for it. Additionally, as you
    can imagine, the volumes of messages being received by these systems could get
    large, hence there is a possibility the message could get dropped. The ACK serves
    as a confirmation that:\n\n1. the message (specified by an identifier) was received;\n2.
    the message is valid based on HL7 processing rules (more on this in a minute);
    and optionally\n3. the message data has been taken into a transient store like
    a processing queue or permanent store like a database (more on this in a minute
    as well).\n\n## Types of ACK messages and associated processing rules\n\nAs you
    can see, the ACK message is **not** like the delivery acknowledgement you get
    when you send an email or text message - it's not a \"I got it\" message. One
    can specify whether original or enhanced processing rules are to be applied to
    the message. Based on this specification, the inbound message is processed differently
    and a different kind of ACK message is sent back. The ACK message and the associated
    processing rules are defined based on the MSH (message header) segment content
    (more details on the MSH segment was discussed in an [earlier post](/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)).\n\n###
    Original mode\n\nOriginal mode processing is indicated if both the 15th and 16th
    fields of the MSH segment of the inbound message is null or empty.\n\nAny inbound
    message with an MSH segment indicating original mode processing will be validated
    for correct syntax and goes through a two step process:\n\n### STEP 1 - Protocol
    validation\n\nThis is used to to assure that:\n\n1. the value in message type
    field (MSH - field #9) is one that is acceptable to the receiver i.e. an ADT^A20
    message may be rejected by a billing system;\n2. the value in version ID field
    (MSH-12) is acceptable to the receiver i.e. if the systems expects HL7 v2.3.1
    and the field says v2.6, then, in the immortal words from a famous film \"what
    we've got here is (a) failure to communicate\";\n3. the value in processing ID
    (MSH-11) is appropriate for the application process handling the message.\n\nIf
    any of these checks fail, the protocol software will reject the message with an
    ACK message containing \"AR\" in the acknowledgment code field (MSA-1). If it
    doesn't fail, it passes the message to the application.\n\n### STEP 2 - Application
    validation\n\nThe application validation checks are:\n\n1. if the application
    processes the message successfully, it will generate the functional response message
    with a value of AA in acknowledgment code (MSA-1);\n2. or the application will
    send an error response, with a value of AE in acknowledgment code (MSA-1);\n3.
    if the application fails to process (reject) the message because of system uptime
    or other reasons and not for format or validation errors. The response message
    contains a value of AR in acknowledgment code (MSA-1). The message can sometimes
    be re-sent later but that is up to the sending system and the implementation to
    figure out.\n\n## Enhanced mode\n\nEnhanced mode processing is indicated if at
    least one of the 15th and 16th fields of the MSH segment of the inbound message
    is not null. Enhanced mode requires that the receiving application take on additional
    responsibility namely that:\n\n1. the inbound message is received and stored;\n2.
    message passes syntax validation;\n3. the message type (ADT-A19 can be processed),
    version is correct (HL7 v2.3.1 and not v2.6 for example) and processing ID is
    correct - if not a commit reject (CR) message will be sent.\n\nBased on these
    rules, the receiving system will send\n\n1. a commit accept (CA) if all OK;\n2.
    a commit reject (CR) as above; or\n3. a commit error (CE) for any other error.\n\n###
    Custom ACK\n\nWhat is health IT without some customization? Not surprisingly,
    it is possible to send a Non-HL7/Static String ACK. This is a custom acknowledgement
    and is simply a text string (rather than an HL7-formatted ACK). These types of
    ACKs are used when an inbound system is incapable of receiving HL7 formatted messages
    or creating them.\n\n## Rate limiting with ACK messages\n\nThe HL7 standard defines
    that the sending systems cannot send another message to a system until it has
    received an ACK in response. Actually, that is not quite correct (thanks for a
    reader for pointing this out to us). It is not part of the HL7 specification.
    It is usually the way the HL7 systems are implemented in *practice* to ensure
    messages are handled appropriatelt.  This was done, one presumes, to ensure that
    if messages are rejected due to errors in content, message formats, system downtime
    etc., they can be corrected either at the source or queued until the destination
    system comes back up. But as you can immediately see, if the next message won't
    be sent until an ACK is received, it is possible to slow down the rate of inbound
    messages by delaying the sending of the ACK message. Since processing of HL7 messages
    using open source tools have challenges when inbound message rates become high,
    this is one of the levers that is available to implementers to ensure messages
    are received and processed appropriately.\n\nOur resident expert on HL7, [Mark
    Olschesky](/about/mark/) explains this more as follows. Previous to v2.7, the
    only ACKs that were \"official\" were your classic Original Mode and Enhanced
    Mode ACKs. There was no way that an upstream system to really know within the
    standard what you were going to do with the message. As such, the only valid assumption
    was that \n\n- the message was processed without error upon receiving the ACK
    or \n- was not processed correctly with a NACK or no ACK. \n\nThis also makes
    sense logistically as well, i.e. it would be dangerous to send/process an update
    to a patient record if you weren't able to process the initial event which would
    seed that patient into your system (or receive an update to a note you didn't
    have, etc.). Most of HL7's design is linear, and doesn't have much of a concept
    of eventual consistency. Note that there were always exceptions around this (notably
    systems which had no capability to respond with an ACK).\n\nIn 2.7, a new field
    was added to the 15th segment of the MSH segment of the ACK which allows the receiving
    system to indicate to the sending what it was going to do with the message after
    it received it. While folks had been doing this tacitly for years beforehand,
    the intent in design was to accommodate for interface engines which receive a
    message and then fan it out to a multitude of systems, providing some closure
    to the sending system as the receiving system cranked along and did its work.
    This was usually a tacit admonishment in design that the interface engine (and
    team working on it) was now responsible for troubleshooting vs. the ADT or EHR
    system which generated the original message type.\n\nNow you know as much as I
    do about ACKs. Go forth and prosper.\n\nIf you’re looking to integrate EHR data

  :summary: 'The Order Entry (ORM) message is a common HL7 message type. ORM messages
    contain information about an order, most commonly radiology or lab orders. '
  :lead: The Order Entry (ORM) message is one of the most commonly used HL7 message
    type. ORM messages contain information about an order. This includes placing new
    orders, canceling existing orders, discontinuation, holding, etc. Orders pertain
    to either materials (e.g., 1 liter of 0.9% saline) or services (e.g., a blood
    panel, etc.). Usually this is patient specific. The trigger event for this message
    is any change to an order i.e. order is created, modified, cancelled, put on hold
    and so on.
  :post: "Before we jump into ORM messages, a quick review might be in order. As we've
    discussed [before](/discover/ehr-integrations/), HL7 has many message types which
    can be very daunting. It's not only that there are messages but also that there
    are types of HL7 messages which are geared towards handling specific events. Admission,
    Discharge, Transfer (ADT) messages are sent when patient's are admitted, discharged
    or otherwise moved around the hospital. Scheduling (SIU) messages schedule and
    update appointments in clinics. Order Entry (ORM) messages are sent when orders
    are placed or edited and Order Result (ORU) messages are sent back with results
    that correspond to the original ORM message. These are the most common HL7 message
    types; most other workflows, like updating flowsheets or filing visit notes, use
    some combination of segments from these message types to accomplish their goals.
    Since we already covered the ADT message in detail [here](/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/),
    we thought we could move onto the Order Entry (ORM) message.\n\nAs mentioned earlier,
    an order is a request for material or services, usually for a specific patient.
    These could be anything ranging from medication orders, measuring of vitals, lab
    tests, specific food / dietary orders, radiology films. These could also be generic
    orders (not clinical or pertaining to patient) for materials required to keep
    the hospital running i.e. linens from housekeeping, supplies from central supply
    etc. If something needs to happen in a hospital or clinic, from printing a requisition
    to e-prescribing, orders distribute pertinent data from system to system.\n\nORM
    messages are most commonly used to send Radiology Orders and Lab Orders[1]. Following
    the standard HL7 message structure, an ORM message is made up of segments and
    groups of segments, each of which may be required, optional, repeatable, or some
    combination thereof. A quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to
    contain a bunch of [],{} etc. The general rule is as follows:\n- No brackets around
    it - **Required**\n- `[]` - **Optional**\n- `{ }` - **Repeating**\n- `[{ }]` -
    **Optional Repeating**\n\nThe ORM message structure is as follows.\n\n~~~javascript\nORM
    \    General Order Message\nMSH     Message Header\n [{NTE}]    Notes and Comments
    (for Header)\n[\n   PID     Patient Identification\n   [PD1]    Additional Patient
    Identification\n      [{NTE}]  Notes and Comments (for Patient ID)\n   [PV1    Patient

    \     [IN2]   Insurance Additional Info\n   [IN3]   Insurance Additional Info\n

    \             [{NTE}] Notes and Comments (for Results)\n         }\n       ]\n
    \ ]\n  {[CTI]}   Clinical Trial Identification\n [BLG]    Billing segment\n }\n~~~\n{:
    .prettyprint .lang-js}\n\nA couple of interesting things to note before we work
    through an example.\n\n- As mentioned earlier, the ORM message can be used to
    send patient specific orders or just operational orders (like ordering sheets
    etc.) which is why, the PID segment above is an optional segment. The segment
    is only required in the case of new orders and only if the new order is related
    to a particular patient. Only then will / should  the PID segment be included
    in the message.\n- Note the presence of multiple (optional, repeatable) Diagnosis
    (DG1) segments. If repeated, the first will be the primary diagnosis.\n- Note
    the presence of the OBX (Observation) segment as an optional, repeatable segment.
    The use here is different from its use in the ORU (Observational Report - Unsolicited)
    message. When used, it carries clinical information that might be needed by the
    receiving system to interpret the observation that will be made, rather than information
    about observations and results. So if the consuming system is an Imaging system,
    then the ID would be set to TCM and and additional context around the order would
    be sent (for example, CPT code of order with the associated description- 73610^X-RAY
    ANKLE 3+ VW). Similarly, other ID types allowed include GDT (narrative), Addendum
    (ADT), Study Notes (TCM), Transcribed Reports (TX).\n\nWith that out of the way,
    let's take a simple message and see how it gets translated into an HL7 ORM message.\n\nThe
    message I want to send is: A male, African American patient, John Appleseed, MRN:20891312,
    SSN:123-45-7890 born on December 1, 1966 and account number of 11480003 needs
    to have X-Ray of his ankle done. The order is being place by Dr. James Matthews.
    The exact procedure to be performed is X-RAY ANKLE 3+ VW with the associated CPT
    code  of 73610. This is based upon a diagnosis of Broken Ankle. Additional information
    that will need to be sent will include facility, sending and receiving systems,
    the version of HL7 being used etc.\n\nBased on this information, the segments
    would be created as follows:\n\n#### MSH - Message Header\nAssuming an all Epic
    environment i.e. sending and receiving systems are all Epic and order is created
    at 2014/04/18 at 17:33:14. Version of HL7 being used is v2.3. This would result
    in a segment that looks like this.\n\n~~~shell\nMSH|^~\\&|EPIC|EPIC|||20140418173314|1148|ORM^O01|497|D|2.3||\n~~~\n{:

    number of the originating (placer) system (987654 from EPIC), the order number
    of the system filling this (for reference - 76543 from EPIC). Additional details
    that need to be filled in include dates and times of transaction, who created

  :summary: 'The HL7 SIU and HL7 SRM message types are HL7 appointment scheduling
    messages with date and time, resources, services, location, and more appoint info. '
  :post: "The SIU (Schedule Information Unsolicited) and SRM (Schedule Request Message)
    messages contain information related to appointment scheduling. SRM messages are
    used for requesting changes to a health system's schedule, such as a request for
    a new appointment booking, appointment rescheduling, modification, cancellation,
    etc. SIU messages are used to notify auxiliary applications of a change made to
    the health system's schedule, such as a notification for the booking of a new
    appointment, appointment rescheduling, modification, cancellation, etc. Scheduling
    messages contain information about the appointment date and time, resources, services,
    location, and any other pertinent information regarding the appointment. The purpose
    or action prescribed by any scheduling message will depend entirely on the trigger
    event (See the List of Trigger Events below). \n\nFollowing the standard HL7 message
    structure, an SIU or SRM message is made up of segments and groups of segments,
    each of which may be required, optional, repeatable, or some combination thereof.
    A quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to contain a bunch of
    [],{} etc. The general rule is as follows:\n\n- No brackets around it - Required\n-
    [] - **Optional**\n- { } - **Repeating**\n- [{ }] - **Optional Repeating**\n\nBelow
    are the message structures of both the SIU and the SRM:\n\n##SIU Message Structure\n```\nSIU

    \    Notes and Comments (for Personnel)\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\nThere are a few things
    to note about the message structures. As you may have already noticed, the structure
    of the two message types are virtually identical. We'll discuss that more later.
    For now, we will explore the shared features of both the SIU and SRM:\n\n- The
    Resource Group segment (RGS) is always required, and may contain more than one
    resource group. This segment acts as a header for the collection of resource segments
    that follow it.\n\n- Within a Resource Group, the Appointment Service Information
    (AIS) is the only required resource segment. This suggests that any new/requested
    appointment must have a scheduled service attached to it.\n\n- Note the presence
    of multiple (optional, repeatable) Diagnosis (DG1) segments. If repeated, the
    first will be the primary diagnosis.\n\n- Note the presence of the OBX (Observation)
    segment as an optional, repeatable segment. The use here is different from its
    use in the ORU (Observational Report - Unsolicited) message. When used, it contains
    notes and comments pertaining to the patient in much the same way an NTE segment
    would, rather than information about observations and results. For instance, the
    OBX segments may contain a Transcribed Report (TX) with patient information that
    may be relevant to the appointment. \n\nAs mentioned before, the only apparent
    difference between the structure of an SIU message and an SRM message is the second
    segment. The SIU message contains an **SCH** segment whereas the SRM message contains
    an **ARQ** segment. Even these two segments share most of the same fields. However,
    there are some key differences, notably:\n\n- **Date/Time Range**\n\tIn the SIU
    message, the SCH segment contains one field with all of the appointment timing/quantity
    information in one place (SCH.11). In the SRM message, the ARQ segment has four
    separate fields for appointment timing quantity. They consist of one required
    field for the requested start date/time range (ARQ.11) and the optional fields
    for appointment priority (ARQ.12), repeating interval (ARQ.13), and the interval
    duration (ARQ.14).\n\n- **Audit Trail Contacts**\n\tThe SIU message can contain
    the name, phone number, address, and location information for the person who \"placed\"
    the appointment (SCH.12 - SCH.15), the person who \"filled\" the appointment (SCH.16
    - SCH.19), and the person who \"entered\" the appointment (SCH.20 - SCH.22). As
    an SRM message is sent only when an appointment has not yet been filled, the ARQ
    segment only contains fields for the placer (ARQ.15 - ARQ.18) and enterer (ARQ.19
    - ARQ.21) of the appointment.\n\t\n- **Filler Status Code**\n\tThe status of the
    appointment is only present in SIU messages (SCH.25). This is, again, due to the
    fact that a scheduling request must be filled before it can have any status other
    than \"requested\".\n\nApart from the few differences between the SCH segment
    and the ARQ segment, there is no structural difference between an SIU message
    and an SRM message. However, the main difference between any two message types
    comes not from the structure of the message, but from the action prescribed by
    the different trigger events.\n\n### List of Trigger Events\n\nTrigger events
    for SRM:\n\n| Segment ID | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| S01
    | Request New Appointment Booking |\n| S02 | Request Appointment Rescheduling
    |\n| S03 | Request Appointment Modification |\n| S04 | Request Appointment Cancellation
    |\n\nTrigger Events for SIU:\n\n|Segment ID | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n|
    S12 | Notification of New Appointment Booking |\n| S13 | Notification of Appointment
    Rescheduling |\n| S14 | Notification of Appointment Modification |\n| S15 | Notification
    of Appointment Cancellation |\n| S26 | Notification that Patient did not show
    up for Scheduled Appointment |\n\n### Message Construction\n\nThe message I want
    to send is: A female, Caucasian patient, Jane Fredericks, MRN:30745109, SSN:321-87-6543
    born on May 1, 1973 and account number of 11396810 wants to schedule a new appointment
    to have an X-Ray taken of her ankle. The appointment request is being placed by
    Dr. James Matthews. The exact service to be performed is X-RAY ANKLE 3+ VW with
    the associated CPT code of 73610. This is based upon a diagnosis of Broken Ankle.
    Additional information that will need to be sent will include the appointment
    date and time, duration, sending and receiving systems, the version of HL7 being
    used etc. The request is approved and the hospital sends a notification for the
    new appointment booking.\n\nBased on this information, the segments would be created
    as follows:\n\n#### MSH - Message Header\nAssuming an all Epic environment i.e.
    sending and receiving systems are all Epic and request is created at 2016/05/02
    at 16:20:33. Version of HL7 being used is v2.3. Since this message is a notification
    for a new appointment booking, the message type is SIU and the trigger event is
    S12. This would result in a segment that looks like this.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|EPIC|EPIC|||20160502162033||SIU^S12|538|D|2.3||\n```\n\n####
    SCH\nThis contains all of the scheduling information - the placer and filler application's
    appointment identifiers, duration, start time, the person who requested the appointment,
    and the appointment status. To keep things simple, we'll only include the identifiers
    and required information.\n\n```\nSCH|01928374|57483920|||||||1|hr|1^^^20160515133000|||||||||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A|||||BOOKED\n```\n\n####
    PID - Patient Identification\nSince this message is a patient specific request,
    it needs all the associated patient info to prevent any confusion. This would
    include the patient's identifier, full name, DOB, sex, race, address, phone number(s),
    account number, SSN and place of birth.\n\n```\nPID|1||30745109^^^^EPI||FREDERICKS^JANE^I^^MRS.^||19730501|F||Cauc|421

    PV1 - Patient Visit\nThis usually contains information on the admission information,
    attending, referring and consulting, admitting physician IDs and names and so
    on. I'll just keep it simple and just have the attending physician's info in the
    sample giving us\n\n```\nPV1|||^^^CARE HEALTH SYSTEMS^^^^^||| |1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^||||||||||||610613||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||V\n```\n\n####
    DG1 - Diagnosis\nSome basic context needs to be provided so that the billing systems
    can do their work so diagnosis information is also provided. So in ICD10 (I10),
    ankle fracture is coded as S82.\n\n```\nDG1||I10|S82^ANKLE FRACTURE^I10|ANKLE
    FRACTURE||\n```\n\n#### RGS - Resource Group\nThis is brief header for the group
    of resource segments that follow it. Included is the number of the resource group,
    the action prescribed (here it's \"add\", or 'A'), and the group ID. This group
    ID may be used for modifying or rescheduling the resource group at a later date.\n\n```\nRGS|1|A|094\n```\n\n####
    AIS - Appointment Info. - Service\nThis contains information related to the scheduled
    service. In this case, it will be an X-Ray for the patient's ankle. Along with
    the CPT code for the scheduled service, the segment also contains the time the
    service is expected to start (may be different from the appointment start time)
    and the length of time the service will be needed.\n\n```\nAIS|1||73610^X-RAY
    ANKLE 3+ VW^CPT|20160515134500|15|min|45|min||\n```\n\n#### AIP - Appointment
    Info. - Personnel\nThis optional repeating segment identifies personnel needed
    for the appointment that are not explicitly mentioned anywhere else in the message.
    For the scheduled appointment, a radiologist (Allan Good) will be needed to perform
    the X-Ray. Just like the AIS segment, this segment contains the time the radiologist
    will be needed and for how long, which gives us\n\n```\nAIP|1||1069^GOOD^ALLAN^B|RADIOLOGIST||20160515134500|15|min|45|min||\n```\n\n###
    Putting it all together\nTo assemble the SIU message, we string together the message
    segments following the message structure outlined above:\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|EPIC|EPIC|||20160502162033||SIU^S12|538|D|2.3||\nSCH|01928374|57483920|||||||1|hr|1^^^20160515133000|||||||||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A|||||BOOKED\nPID|1||30745109^^^^EPI||FREDERICKS^JANE^I^^MRS.^||19730501|F||Cauc|421

  :summary: 'The Medical Document Management (MDM) message is a commonly used HL7
    message type that provides information about new or updated notes or documents. '
  :post: "The Medical Document Management (MDM) message is a commonly used HL7 message
    type that provides information about new or updated notes or documents. Per the
    HL7 standard, it's main purpose is \"to produce an accurate, legal, and legible
    document that serves as a comprehensive account of healthcare services provided
    to a patient\".\n\nThere are several MDM message trigger events and they can be
    split into two categores - those that describe the status of the document and
    those that both describe the document and also contain the document itself:\n\n|
    MDM Subtype | Trigger Event/Description |\n|-------------|---------------------------|\n|
    T01 | Original Document Notification |\n| T02 | Original Document Notification
    with Content |\n| T03 | Document Status Change Notification |\n| T04 | Document
    Status Change Notification with Content |\n| T05 | Document Addendum Notification
    |\n| T06 | Document Addendum Notification with Content |\n| T07 | Document Edit
    Notification |\n| T08 | Document Edit Notification with Content |\n| T09 | Document
    Replacement Notification |\n| T10 | Document Replacement Notification with Content
    | \n| T11 | Document Cancel Notification |\n\n\nFollowing the standard HL7 message
    structure, an MDM message is made up of segments and groups of segments, each
    of which may be required, optional, repeatable, or some combination thereof. A
    quick note on reading HL7 message examples which seem to contain a bunch of [],{}
    etc. The general rule is as follows:\n- No brackets around it - **Required**\n-
    [] - **Optional**\n- { } - **Repeating**\n- [{ }] - **Optional Repeating**\n\nThe
    MDM message structure is as follows.\n```\nMDM     Medical Document Management
    Message\nMSH     Message Header\nPID     Patient Identification\n  [{NTE}]  Notes
    and Comments\nPV1   Patient Visit\n{[\n  ORC    Common Order\n  OBR Observation
    Request\n    [NTE]  Notes and Comments\n]}\nTXA Document Notification\n  [{NTE}]
    Notes and Comments\n{\n  OBX* Observation notes\n    [{NTE}] Notes and Comments\n}\n```\n\nSome
    notes on the above triggers and message structure:\n\n- The most common of the
    MDM subtypes is the T02 because it notifies the receiving system that a new document
    has been created and also includes the document content itself. One typical workflow
    will have a vendor write notes back into the EMR via an MDM^T02 so that the notes
    are loaded into a patient's chart and available for physician review.\n\n- The
    ORC/OBR segments are optional and are mostly only used for workflows like order-based
    transcriptions, where an order can be created or updated by the MDM message.\n\n-
    Note the asterisk (*) next to the OBX segment. That's there to indicate that MDM
    messages will only include repeating OBX segments if they include the document
    content itself. The content is stored in the OBX segment(s) in a format dictated
    by the receiving system. Some possible formats include: plain text, formatted
    text (ie. RTF), or base64-encoded documents like PDFs. The document can be split
    across multiple OBX segments or stored in one single OBX dependent on the preference
    of the receiving system or the character limits of each segment. \n\nNow let's
    break down an example MDM HL7 message by each segment. The message we want to
    send is: a note containing a consulting physician's (James A. Matthews) clinical
    diagnosis has been created and should be attached to a patient's chart. The patient
    is Mike J. Thomas: male, African American, MRN:12983718, SSN:123-45-9999, born
    on January 1, 1970, account number: 18273652.\n\nBased on this information, the
    required segments would be created as follows:\n\n**MSH - Message Header**\nLet's
    assume an all Epic environment, i.e. the sending and receiving systems are both
    Epic, and that the note is created on 2016/05/10 at 07:16:33. Also, the version
    of HL7 being used is v2.3. This would result in a segment that looks like this.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|Epic|Epic|||20160510071633||MDM^T02|12345|D|2.3\n```\n\n**PID
    - Patient Identification**\nHere we identify which patient this note is about.
    We include the patient's identifier, full name, DOB, sex, race, address, phone
    number(s), account number, SSN and place of birth. Some of these are optional
    as described in the format specification:\n\n```\nPID|1||12983718^^^^EPI||Thomas^Mike^J^^MR.^||19500101|M||AfrAm|506
    S. HAMILTON AVE^^MADISON^WI^53505^US^^^DN |DN|(608)123-9998|(608)123-5679||S||18273652|123-45-9999||||^^^WI^^\n```\n\n**PV1
    - Patient Visit**\nThis usually contains information on the admission information,
    attending, referring and consulting, admitting physician IDs and names and so
    on. We'll just keep it simple and just have the consulting physician's info:\n\n```\nPV1|||^^^CARE
    HEALTH SYSTEMS^^^^^||||||1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^||||||||||||\n```\n\n**TXA -
    Document Notification**\nThe TXA segment contains information about the transcribed
    document including the report type, date/time, provider info, a unique document
    number assigned by the sending system (ex: 12345), and a document status (ex:
    PA = Pre-Authenticated):\n\n```\nTXA||CN||20160510071633|1173^MATTHEWS^JAMES^A^^^|||||||^^12345|||||PA|\n```\n\n**OBX
    - Observation**\nOBX segment(s) contain the document content itself. Here, we'll
    split out document contents into multiple OBX segments for clarity though this
    isn't a requirement. The receiving system should dictate their preference. In
    this example, TX indicates the content will be in plain text:\n\n```\nOBX|1|TX|||Clinical
    summary: Based on the information provided, the patient likely has viral sinusitis
    \ commonly called a head cold.\nOBX|2|TX|||Diagnosis: Viral Sinusitis\nOBX|3|TX|||Diagnosis
    ICD: J01.90\nOBX|4|TX|||Prescription: benzonatate (Tessalon Perles) 100mg oral
    tablet 30 tablets, 5 days supply. Take one to two tablets by mouth three times
    a day as needed. disp. 30. Refills: 0, Refill as needed: no, Allow substitutions:
    yes\n```\n\nNow, putting them all together we get the full HL7 MDM message.\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|Epic|Epic|||20160510071633||MDM^T02|12345|D|2.3\nPID|1||12983718^^^^EPI||Thomas^Mike^J^^MR.^||19500101|M||AfrAm|506

  :summary: Lets walk through the names, players and timelines for delivering your
    first HL7 Epic integration or any other EHR integration like Cerner or Allscripts.
  :lead: |-
    You did it! You made your first big sale to a hospital. Your product is live. You proved your efficacy, and the impact with clinicians and patients is evident. To reduce double documentation or improve your application, your customer wants to receive data from the EHR. You'll need to work with a project team, sometimes 200-persons large, while mastering a new skillset.

    What needs to be done? Lets walk through the names, the players and the timelines of delivering your first integration with Epic Systems EHR (EpicCare) or any other EHR like Cerner or Allscripts.
  :post: |
    ### The Players

    **Project Manager** - The person responsible for running the project plan and gathering resources. Depending on the integration size or scope, this person might wear multiple hats within IT *or* might be involved with operations within the healthcare organization itself.

    **Operational Owner** - The person responsible for buying your software (or their proxy) and your internal champion. This person will likely be involved in bringing the rest of the team in and helping you navigate through the system. This can be anyone from a department head to the CIO of the organization.

    **System Administrator/Network Engineer** - The person responsible for getting the VPN setup, which is likely the second thing you will do in the integration setup process. Knows that interfaces connect to IP addresses and ports, but likely isn't that curious about what data gets sent across.

    **Interface Engine Analyst/Engineer** - The person responsible for ensuring that the data is passing through the VPN and hitting the appropriate port on the interface engine. The interface engine is probably a product like Rhapsody, Intersystems Ensemble or eGate; all interfaces from all clinical software (not just the EHR) go through here. This person sets up the ports on the IP addresses you need to connect with. He or she usually isn't responsible for the details about the specific interface, but if your HL7 messages do not pass certain formatting/filtering criteria there will likely be errors that you will need to troubleshoot with this person. At a smaller organization, this may be the same person as the EHR Interface Analyst.

    **EHR/Application Interface Analyst/Engineer** - The person responsible for making sure that data from the Interface Engine drops an HL7 message from the Interface Engine successfully into the EHR. In Epic, this person is the *Bridges Analyst* and in Cerner they are the *Open Engine* analyst. If your data has an improperly formatted field or mapping, is using the wrong identifier for a person/order/document, or otherwise has a problem getting into the EHR, this person will let you know about the problem. It's worth noting that you'll probably only need to work closely with this person on *writing data into the EHR* via notes, flowsheets or results.

    **EHR (or application) Web Services Analyst/Engineer** - In many cases, notably when working with Epic, the person responsible for HL7 integration might not be the same person responsible for working with Web Services. In Epic, Web Services are used for NCPDP messages (ePrescribing), FHIR, IHE protocols (PIX/PDQ, XDS.b queries), and functions that relate to MyChart. [Epic explains this better than I can](http://open.epic.com/). Likewise, Cerner has MillenniumObjects and Allscripts has its own API for integration purposes. There may be some overlap between the Interface and Web Services roles; the big reason that there may be separation is that since these are different products from the EHR Vendor, support and staff may be bifurcated accordingly.

    **EHR/Application Analyst** - For writing data into the EHR, you'll need to validate the data that you are writing back into the EHR shows up in the right places (or that the "right places" are in fact built) For getting data out of the EHR, you'll need someone to trigger events (like scheduling an appointment or discharging a patient) to test the workflow that integration is facilitating. This is written up as one job role, but realistically it'll be different team members for various workflows. These may be some of the applications and their Epic application name that you would need to ensure that you had the right person online for testing.

    * Outpatient EHR (EpicCare Ambulatory) - Orders, Results, Notes, Flowsheets(discrete data).
    * Inpatient EHR (EpicCare Inpatient) - Orders, Results, Notes, Device Integration, Flowsheets(discrete data)
    * Scheduling (Cadence) - Scheduling, Patient Demographic Updates
    * Registration (ADT) - Hospital Patient Registration, Admissions, Discharges, Transfers [1](#footnote-1)
    * Surgery (OpTime) - Scheduling Surgical Cases
    * Lab/Radiology/Cardiology LIS/RIS/CVIS (Beaker/Radiant/Cupid) - Scheduling/Registration/Results for Lab/Radiology/Cardiology + Procedure Logs + Results
    * EMPI (Identity) - EMPI queries
    * Other - MyChart, Care Everywhere, other Web Services [2](#footnote-2)

    It's also worth noting that the process of getting data in or out the EHR doesn't necessary actualize its usefulness. Your Operational Owner should work with the appropriate EHR analysts to ensure that data written into the EHR is displayed in the correct reports and dashboards while ensuring that data that needs to be generated from the EHR receives the proper treatment in terms of decision support and workflow training.

    **Support Staff** - A larger organization likely has team members handle some amount of support. This person is probably who will contact you if there is downtime from the Hospital side or if they notice that errors are pooling up on your interface connection. Likewise, you will want to inform this person (or some other centralized resource) in the event that you notice a degradation of service

    ### The Stack

    We use Mirth Connect with Postgres as a backend here at Datica and I highly recommend it. It's open source with a permissive license and can satisfy most integrations needs for startups. It's ranked highly in KLAS. [You can give it a try here.](http://www.mirthcorp.com/products/mirth-connect)

    ### Why Datica?

    With all this information in tow, why do you need an integration partner?

    Because there is so much more to do. It takes plenty of specialized experience to make your first HL7 project go well, and Datica provides this for you in house. We provide you with:

    * A load-balanced, secure, highly-available Interface Engine on scalable cloud infrastructure (5 VMs). We run Mirth Connect, an open-source, KLAS ranked Interface Engine. Our infrastructure has been through two HIPAA audits and one HITRUST audit and is ready to plug into any healthcare organization in the country.
    * A dedicated hardware firewall that will meet the needs and bandwidth for any VPN with any healthcare organization in the United States.
    * Burst onto the scene with instant credibility in HL7: Certified EHR and Networking (CCNA) Professionals with years of experience on hand to guide you through the process of setting up an integration. We've worked with most EHR vendors and we're willing to do whatever it takes it get an integration done.
    * Lean on the tooling we've already built for customers and use our standard HL7-to-JSON libraries to get data in a format that's easier to deal with than pipe-delimited mumbo-jumbo.
    * Best-in-class monitoring and support from an engineering-first company.
    * Straight-forward pricing: Do you know that in 1990 the pitch for HL7 involved pricing for an interface costing less than $10,000? Why are you still paying through the teeth for it now?

    ### Conclusion

    We want to make interoperability easier for everyone. Look forward to more open-sourced advice and documentation in the future.

    [1]<a id="footnote-1"></a> There isn't always a clean line between Outpatient/Inpatient applications. There may be "outpatient" clinics in a hospital, which may use multiple systems. When in doubt, let the hospital pull in the right people.

    [2]<a id="footnote-2"></a> There are many new Epic apps and integrations possible every year. The ones listed are amongst the most common apps and integrations, but the list is not inclusive or wholly complete. If you're not sure who is responsible for a specific integration, it's best to lean on your operational owner/project manager who needs to be involved to get something done.

  :summary: Mohan Balachandran chats with HL7 CEO Charles Jaffe, MD in this podcast
    presentation. From this segment, listeners will discover more about FHIR and learn
    why developers and hospital systems shouldn’t wait for a fully baked data exchange
    standard. Healthcare leaders often raise many questions around FHIR and Dr. Jaffe
    provides clarity around those questions. With standards as a critical component
    of healthcare innovation, this FHIR-based podcast is a must for those who can’t
    get enough understanding of FHIR.
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn about the three products of the FHIR Foundation
    2. Discover ways that FHIR can enable clinical decision support and personalized medicine
    3. Hear first hand when FHIR will become a normative standard
    4. Be directed to the face-to-face opportunities available with the HL7 organization
  :post: |-
    **On the origination of FHIR:** "Five years ago, as part of the HL7 Fresh Look initiative, we developed the FHIR standard. And that standard has evolved so that we are about to emerge as a normative standard in the spring. By normative standard I mean one that has been validated and approved by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI."

    **On the future promise of FHIR:** "I think as we move forward, we'll see more and more applications suited to healthcare literacy, so patients aren't confronted with their lab results but have access to explanations of their procedures, lab tests, results, diagnosis and the medications they take, all on a convenient single interface."

    **On leveraging data for precision medicine:** "No longer will we give the same starting dose of the same drug for every patient that has elevated blood pressure. But they will be able to adjust, not on the dose, but the type of medication specifically for the pathology inherent in the elevation of the blood pressure and the genetic characteristics of the patient that has to take it."

    [FHIR has] reached a point of adoption where there is enough critical mass to ensure that these APIs that the stability of the standard and the usefulness of the platform can be assured."

    **On FHIR’s direct impact:** "FHIR is very fast to develop so the ease with which application development and therefore the cost of application development has been brought down critically."

    **On groups leveraging FHIR:** "One of these is the clinical research community. So not only the regulated research community -- bio, pharma and small bio-tech, but also the academic research community sees an opportunity to obtain data from multiple sources. But more importantly, bring data from other sources there."

    **On clinical decision support:** "I think one of the critical areas that physicians often overlook that leverage the value of electronic health records is clinical decision support. So there is an initiative in support of FHIR called CDS Hooks, which use FHIR to access the many commercial and public databases for clinical decision support."

  :summary: '*The Healthcare Innovators Podcast* is proud to connect you with Grahame
    Grieve, Product Director of FHIR for HL7. Grahame hails from Melbourne, Australia
    and has come to be industry known as the "Father of FHIR." Before creating the
    Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, he spent years working with the HL7
    standards that assist in transferring clinical and administrative data between
    software applications. Today, we''ll learn a bit more about the background of
    FHIR and why healthcare subdomains are attracted to the FHIR standard. This is
    first in a three-part interview series around the FHIR standard and one that will
    leave you laughing as Grieve shares his favorite answer to what FHIR stands for. '
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Discover what potential healthcare requirement would force everyone to re-engineer their interfaces
    2. Learn the architectural advantage of FHIR versus other data exchange standards
    3. Understand Grahame's thoughts around open-source and its importance
    4. Discover the unrealized dream for FHIR and why Grahame wants to eventually come back to it
  :post: |-
    **On which subdomain is expressing the most Interest:** "The one that is getting the most focus and attraction right now is EHRs. We have projects in multiple countries, particularly in the USA, to provide open EHR access to data. That's primarily the highest profile work that we have going, but everybody's working relatively hard."

    **On the origin of naming FHIR:** "I'm very happy to say it wasn't my idea. Once it became clear that we had a working standard, I just called resources for help because I'm a boring kind of techie geek. I just called it what it was. Then the marketing committee at HL7 looked at it and said, 'if you want this to be a big deal, you've got to give it a funny name, so people can play with the name.' They banged it around and came up with the FHIR name."

    **On a favorite FHIR acronym twist:** "I've heard them all, but there are always new ones, as well as puns on the FHIR as part of the name. There's also a whole series of jokes around what the latest F-H-I-R actually stands for. My personal favorite is: 'Fixing HL7's International Reputation'."

    **On FHIR current pilots: ** "At the moment, we have prototypes and pilot projects in many countries in the world, in many domains. Some are high profile projects; some are under the radar projects. My focus is now on scaling up the community, because that's where our focus needs to be, because we are getting more and more implementations. In the next five years, FHIR will transition from being the next greatest thing to what everybody does, and becoming boring, in fact."

    **On the advantage of FHIR:** "One of the architectural advantages of FHIR versus other healthcare data exchange processes is that we leverage the Web."

    **On high-profile hacks: ** "Given the number of high profile identity hacks we've had this year, and those are only the reported ones, I think that we should stop assuming that there is any security around people's fundamental identification and the same should apply to their health. Instead of regarding that as necessary to secure, I think society will be forced to move to a world where everybody's information is open, and the social consequences aren't there."

    **On open-sourcing FHIR:**

    * "Health information should be free — free to move." " ...giving your information away increases its value."
    * "If you hold onto it and try to extract money out of its use, you're actually decreasing the value."
    * "I've become a strident believer in the value of open source for at least the area that we work in. There are a few other specifications providers who are moving away from any form of openness, getting more and more restrictive, insisting that we must pay them or they'll aggressively prosecute. I look at that and say, "I don't know why you would spend so much time decreasing your value."

    **On how much interoperability you need:** "I have a formula: How much interoperability do you need?  The answer is *n* times two, where 'n' is the amount you have."

  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn how governance impacts standards and collaboration in healthcare

    4. Discover the realities of who should own healthcare data
  :post: |-
    *Question 1 (Mohan):* Can you talk about the rationale behind the creation of FHIR?

    > “I believe that it was necessary to create a new set of standards that actually solved the problems people have. Fundamentally, that's why we did it.”

    *Question 2 (Mohan):* What problems was FHIR designed to solve, or that HL7 couldn't solve before?

    > “HL7's context was not around exchanging data, or if it was, it was very limited circumstances; it was hard to leverage and wasn't flexible. I wanted to set that flexibility free so people could write apps to do interesting things with data that other people held.”

    *Question 3 (Mohan):* FHIR seems to be very patient centric and all the associated resources around it. Is that how you are thinking about it — that the patient should be at the center of all the data models and data exchanges?

    > “With FHIR, what's been clear from the very beginning is that it is capability-based. So, FHIR is not necessarily patient centric, in fact there are other kinds of views to take of the record, a practitioner centric view, as well. The key changes that it is capability focused.”

    *Question 3 (Mohan):* So it can be practitioner centric; it is almost resource centric as you see fit, based on the workflow that you want to enable. Is that the correct way to look at it then?

    > “We look at healthcare as a Web of information. And although there are some central navigational points around patient/provider — the patient's relationships with other people, the physical locations where care is provided, the teams that provide care — all of those are key navigational points, but none of them are unique and special.”

    *Question 4 (Mohan):* Is it correct that you could essentially string together these resources in various ways, or flow it in different ways to make up a workflow?

    > “As we grappled with the consequences of people taking different perspectives, we started to understand the wider context of how to string together workflows; now we are grappling with how to relate an exchange workflow with a real world workflow and obligations and how to actually administer the process through FHIR.”

    *Question 5 (Mohan):* When people talk about interoperability, should people talk about it in the context of workflows or should they talk about it in the context of data?

    > “I think there's a duality….from some perspectives it’s not necessarily thinking about it as anything more than data. From other perspectives, thinking about it as data and ignoring the ramifications of workflow just leads you down dead ends and creates problems for you. I think you have to think about what people are trying to achieve and make sure that they've thought about all the ramifications. That's where experience comes to the fore, so that you know where people are likely to go to make short term decisions that will create really bad technical debt later.”

    *Question 6 (Mark):* Was there anything that you had learned working with IHE queries that you wanted to change or avoid when you were designing FHIR?

    > “The work that IHE does is really a key important work and I wanted to make that easier. Some people have said, well, FHIR does all that. But people still need to make their specific agreements and figure out their actors and obligations and their due certification. I wanted to make that a thing with process.”

    *Question 7 (Mark):* Do you see that FHIR would work with the IHE to build some of those testing harnesses, or validations, or do you see that it’s something HL7 would begin doing, or governmental agencies?

    > “Within the FHIR project we have a good validator that does detailed depth validation of the content. We are beefing that up and working with the IHE testing to incorporate that code inside the IHE testing tools. So they will use our code for validation as the seamless part of their overall testing workflow. I'm really pleased that we are going in that direction.”

    > “As for testing, I think HL7 has a role in testing where some things are specified completely by HL7. IHE gets to do testing when IHE is doing the certification, the specification and agreements. Then governments and other agencies should do their own testing for their own decisions. There's clearly going to be a lot of work through the U.S. government in the next three to four years, providing U.S. centric solutions to U.S. government problems and the government will be doing the certification. Or, at least running the certification process.”

    *Question 8 (Mohan):* Given the way enterprises look at interoperability...if they make an investment then that investment should be future proof. How has this lack of current backwards compatibility been received?

    > “One of the great things about FHIR is that it is not fixed in stone, so we can make changes to the specifications in response to user experience. One of the hard things about FHIR is that we can make changes to the specifications in response to user experience. That's a double edged sword. All of the institutions that I've worked with have on the one hand felt good that if they raise issues, those issues can be addressed. All have also felt the risk associated with that.”

    > “Initially there are some organizations that stand back saying that they won't engage until it is stable. But increasingly, organizations are saying they can't afford to wait. Either they want to influence the specification or they have to solve problems now. They understand the fact that It’s still not settled in stone is both good and bad; they have to figure out how to manage the risk and leverage the advantage of that.”

    > “So far that has proved less of a problem than we expected. What we expected was for more people to stand back and say they wouldn’t get involved until it's stable. But, that hasn't happened.”

    *Question 9 (Mohan):* Is the patient model the one that is evolving the most, based upon the kind of feedback you get from customers? Or, based upon usage? Or, is it the medications model?

    > “Our team has focused heavily on the conformance resources, the validation related resources. Tending the implementors, there's the patient provider, encounter, institution set that everybody has to engage with. Then there’s the patient summary stuff. Problem lists, medication lists, observations, vital signs. Those are things that come first for everybody.”

    > “There’s enough breadth of understanding in the community about why we've made the choices that we've made. There's a few elements to add and a few trimmings to make around codes, but it's pretty stable now. We are getting towards probably the next version after the one coming, so later next year, I guess we’ll be having active discussions about calling them being done — fixed and actually backwards compatible from now on.”

    *Question 10 (Mohan):* So that is towards the end of this year is when you think about the first long-term support LDS version of FHIR beginning to come out?

    > “Probably October next year, as a guess.”

    *Question 11 (Mohan):* It seems to be very health system oriented. I know that in the spec of FHIR that you also had models around claims and payments. Are you seeing more interest from the payors participating in this, or is it still being driven by the health systems primarily?

    > “I would characterize the payors interest in FHIR as extremely strong. In fact, critical. They aren’t so fussed about running the payment through FHIR, although there's a project running for that and that has strong engagement. What they are really interested in is MACRA. Because it seems likely, given the standards environment that when it comes to guidelines and gathering data for guideline evaluation and evaluating guidelines, it's going to be using FHIR.”

    *Question 12 (Mohan):* Do you mind talking a little bit more about how they intend to leverage FHIR to do the evaluations that MACRA requires?

    > “There are three parts:* One is to provide an API by which you can ask a data repository to make assessments a healthcare measure, and give you some answer about the measure. Then there’s the actual specification of what the measure is. It’s basically a clinical decision criteria. So it is the same technical infrastructure as clinical decision support. Then there’s the specification of the kind of data that the measures can assume and rely on being available, both in terms of what data is present and as how it is represented.”

    *Question 13 (Mark):* So it would be the health system that would have the API or to expose it, saying, "You can ask about patients who have HbA1c or Metformin, or whatever the metric is, and the payors would be doing the queries strictly of the health system in that regard? Or, would the health system in this kind of vision still be pushing that data to the payors, using FHIR to run their own analytics?

    > “It could be that the payors ask the healthcare system to run the evaluation. But I think it's more likely to be a mixed world.”

    *Question 14 (Mohan):* Because of all the breaches about national security implications of healthcare data are you seeing more conversations focused around security and feed level security around FHIR?

    > “The point about national security is interesting. I’ve had discussions about the ramifications of the OPM breach. Clearly the OPM breach is breaching data of national security interest. Whereas, your healthcare data is probably less directly linked, but your healthcare data is just like OPM data—not changeable. It is anchored in your reality.”

    > “As precision medicine gets more pervasive and everybody gets sequenced, and as the sequence hooks up so that your DNA sequence becomes part of your care, then everybody has as part of your record — really deep information about you. Then presumably, it becomes an even bigger magnet for various kinds of malpractice and malfeasance.”

    > “We pay attention to the contextualization of the security frameworks to healthcare, but we are not providing the security. However, we're starting to notice that we need a good security bulletin framework, which we've never needed before. We need to pay attention to more of the security concerns. So, I expect this will be a growing concern for us. I do think that it is a social problem and society will have to adjust to the risks of big data. I expect that it will be messy.”

    *Question 15 (Mohan):* As we try to implement FHIR, should we plan for the security layer to reside outside of FHIR?

    > “The spot on FHIR is the explanation of how to bridge the security problem and the security frameworks to the information that is available through FHIR. I think it's going to be an important part of exercising FHIR. We delegate the hard work of security to the internet security standards. Our main concern is how to map the security information consequences into the information new exchange, or not. We did a fairly deep security audit of it last year and found some security falls in the model. So we beefed up the model, but I routinely do Oauthentic integrations with other providers using OAuth2, who haven't taken those preventive measures that HL7 has or that spot on FHIR has actually.”

    > “I think perhaps we might need a little bit more depth in the security analysis. You could imagine a single company with single server with lots and lots of clients, well it's even a challenge for them. Say you have clients that need to be updated through the Apple App Store. You've got a problem, but it's even a bigger problem if you've got many servers and many apps; they are all interoperating with each other. Introducing a security change, driven change to the API, that is urgent, is a real nightmare in that circumstance.”

    *Question 16 (Mark):* Do you think FHIR will have an affect on the type of personnel that hospitals, software vendors are going to want to have on staff to be working on integrations? It seems like we are going to have a new skillset versus the implementations that we did with HL7 v2, so how do you see that transforming within organizations within the next few years?

    > “When I talk to implementors in the FHIR community about this is there's this thing that goes around about RESTful APIs — the 5-5-5 rule — 5 seconds to find the API, 5 minutes to understand what it was doing and 5 hours to have something working. But to that I add, 5 years to begin to understand healthcare. That is the key driver that the people you have that understand healthcare can easily learn to understand FHIR and RESTful APIs. So, that won't drive change because it's the people you have that understand healthcare and understand what can be done in interop that are the key great limiting step in any integration that you do.”

    > “The big new skill is around what we've just been talking about –– security. I’m starting to see more security specialists coming into the interop space, because with version 2 it was all like, ‘we just secure the channel and forget about security, pretty much.  With FHIR, it is much more complicated than that. You can't secure the channels, you have to secure the API itself.”

    *Question 17 (Mohan):* And from that regard, you can share OAuth keys all the time, but there's always more detail that is required, client-side, authorization, authentication, which portions of the data are you allowed to share, should share, authority to access. It becomes much more complicated.

    > “There are commercial providers of cloud services, Apigee, Akana, and others, working with our community to provide bullet-proof surface APIs. So, you put up an API, but the only service the API talks to is the cloud responder. That simply provides surface security on your Web presence. You might put up something on Linux, on Apache and there's a new security briefing for some obscure part of that, are you even running it? How do you acknowledge that? You don't have to worry about that because the only service that your server talks to is the cloud service and that's not your business to worry about it. You've never heard of anything like that in the version 2 world.”

    *Question 18 (Mohan):* Is there anything that you wish you had thought of when you started designing FHIR?

    > “There are some things that we set out to do that we haven't done and that have fallen by the wayside a bit and then implementers are starting to notice some of the underlying definition or quality work that we had in mind to do. But, people don’t really ask for that. But the overall design, the agile standards development process, the RESTful API, the pragmatic focus on what implementers need to do in the free licensing, I think those things have held up really well and are driving the overall adoption process. Perhaps in a few years time, we'll start accumulating more regrets around technical decisions, but we can keep changing those at the moment, so we don't particularly regret them yet.”

    *Question 19 (Mark):* One of the things I think we have on the agenda to talk about in the future is the economics of integration. Notably, preliminary thoughts or feelings that you are getting from vendors or hospital organizations about how FHIR would be priced. Will it be like many REST API vendors now by volume, or by licensing, like interfaces are today, or how that might work?

    > “At the patient portal level the government's made it quite clear that there will be no charge to the patients, but someone has got to pay for it somehow, somewhere. The vendors may treat it as core infrastructure so that it's in the overall cost; it's a competition-based thing. Certainly developing a real FHIR solution is not cheap.”

    > “Whoever it is that's going to host the server needs to have the security agents in place. That's going to cost you some money, however you do the deployment. All those things cost real, solid, large amounts of money. It's got to come from somewhere. I don't know where the different kinds of services will come because in principle you would just say that we'll just charge for them directly, but this is healthcare where we prefer indirect, obscure ways of charging for things.”

    *Question 20 (Mohan):* perhaps it will be this indirect kind of model is what ultimately evolves from making the data available, and if it is valuable, you are able to make money off of it.

    > “Certainly in terms of the EHR plug-ins it seems likely that the major vendors will have their own app stores and that will be a revenue opportunity to cover the costs of the overall program. That’s certainly one very small part of the overall ecosystem.”

    > “That’s always a challenge with interop because very often the people paying the cost for it are disconnected from the benefits. So it doesn't happen very well.”

    *Question 21 (Mohan):* Which also ties back to the MACRA conversation. So if we have the entire model shift to value-based care, then something like FHIR, something like interoperability, something like pricing becomes a very different proposition. And that is exactly the conversation that I think we’d like to have next time.

    > “Could be really interesting, because right now is the MACRA preparations start rolling up and suddenly this whole business of economics is not a theoretical concern any more.”

    (Mohan) I appreciate you taking the time. I'm glad that you are in the states; at the same time I'm sure you can't wait to get back home in a couple of weeks. Thanks a lot. Have a good day.

  :summary: 'In this episode, Grahame Grieve, Product Director of FHIR for HL7 continues
    his last interview in a three-part series with Datica. Mark Olschesky, Datica''s
    Chief Data Officer questions Grieve about "The Economics of FHIR and Interoperability"
    for this last interview. The economics of FHIR is a passionate subject for Grieve
    for which he recognizes that no pat answers exist. In this interview, Grieve contextualizes
    the questions and provides possible answers that only time will prove out. '
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn how governance impacts standards and collaboration in healthcare
    2. Understand the complexity of integrations and the role of APIs
    3. Develop greater awareness for crowdsourcing related to FHIR and healthcare technology advancements
    4. Discover the realities of who should own healthcare data
  :post: |-
    **On the road building of healthcare infrastructure:** "It's very similar economics is to road building. It's the creation of infrastructure that enables exchange to happen. Everybody's interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B. But not everybody's interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to get from A to B."

    **On how APIs impact the end user:** "[Clinicians] are trapped in systems that they don't feel bring value to them or their patients."

    "People have **widely variable workflows.** There is no single description of the workflow that worked for everybody."

    "With APIs it's pretty hard to explain to most end users why APIs makes a difference. But if you **focus on the outcome,** which is better integration, better system wide flows of data and more mobility to customize their experience, then that story becomes compelling for a user."

    **On how FHIR and crowdsourcing address mappings:** "FHIR actually includes specific primary artifacts for dealing with crosswalks and mappings, and we're investing as a community, in building the tools around them. But for the first time, part of the main specification of what we do is the ability to publish, share, review those crosswalks and mappings and to make the executable part of the overall frameworks."

    "We would like to set up a community that manages shared, public crosswalks between common coding systems. We have the infrastructure and the community is starting to think about doing that."

    "I'm a very strong believer in crowdsourcing when it comes to something like crosswalks and mappings. And the ability to use the crowd to refine the fine detail."

    **On the growth of free EHR solutions:** "There's certainly going to be a growth of free EHR solutions. Of course, free is a misnomer, somebody's going to pay someone for the implementation, perhaps with consulting fees."

    **On data ownership:** "There are people who argue that the patient should really own the data, but it's not really the patient's data. It's not easy to tell [patient vs provider data] apart and that will continue to be a challenge for us. From a market perspective, the patient can only own the data if the patient pays to own the data. I do not see anyone considering that fact realistically."

    **On security and privacy of patient data:** "[A black market for healthcare] exists because having healthcare data increases your ability to get access to financial accounts."

  :summary: AirStrip is one of the most exciting up-and-coming healthcare vendors
    in the industry. Alan Portela, its CEO, was a natural first option to interview
    for the series. We discussed how to cultivate continuous disruption, the future
    of interoperability, real-time analytics, the AirStrip Innovation Marketplace,
    and a few tips for building a great company. What an interview!
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. A key to continuous disruption is the proper investment in transformational ideas and technology.
    2. The EHRs that don't open themselves up for interoperability are going to be history soon.
    3. The AirStrip Innovation Marketplace is built, among other things, to help academic medical centers translate their transformational ideas into market opportunities.

    **Catalyze:** I’m excited today to have Alan Portela. Alan has 25 years experience in healthcare and a passion for leading disruptive and continuous innovation. Alan is currently the CEO of AirStrip, a position he has held for more than four years. Before joining AirStrip, Alan was the President of CliniComp, Intl., and previously led the implementation of high-acuity EHR systems at the U.S. Military Health System, Veterans Health Administration and a number of prestigious healthcare organizations in the private sector. Alan has held senior executive roles with a number of innovative healthcare technology vendors and was among the leaders who pioneered Global Care Quest, an mHealth company that emerged from UCLA Medical Center Department of Neurosurgery more than a decade ago.

    I’ve been fortunate enough to know Alan for a few years as he has grown AirStrip into one of the preeminent successes in the mobile health space. I'm so excited to have him here today talking about innovation; interoperability and data; and his experience at AirStrip, as well as previous to that. Thanks to Alan for joining us today, we really appreciate it. We know you are a busy guy.

    **Alan Portela:** Thank you Travis for having me.

    **Catalyze:** We’ll jump right in. AirStrip has really been at the front of innovation. There’s some interesting stories about the initial release of AirStrip—the initial versions of iOS and being very early into this space—with its innovative approach and taking a UI-centric focus, which now a lot of people are doing in healthcare. But before, I don’t think a lot of vendors really thought about.

    Curious from your perspective: How does innovation fit in with mission at AirStrip and if part of the mission was driven by you, or was that part of the previous culture at AirStrip?

    **Alan Portela:** This happens a lot with many companies. When we started about 11 years ago, we had people that founded the company that were very innovative and visionary. What these two people had, Cameron Powell, MD, and Trey Moore, the engineer, was a combined share of mission and vision in the fact that they were dealing with mobility in healthcare.

    They introduced medical device mobility, but they concentrated at the beginning on iOS. It created a great opportunity where Steve Jobs invited them in 2010 to the WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC) to talk about iPhone and real-time waveforms. That was a very incredible event because it brought an innovator on the venture capital side and that was Sequoia Capital. They were very fortunate that Sequoia, known to innovate starting out with Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple—all the companies that we know today—they decided to invest in the company. Most likely what happens in situations like that, either you pick an investor that will be able to support continuous disruption or one that would like to execute on what you currently have. Sequoia is more of the continuous disruption to stay ahead of the market. At the time, immediately after their investment, they brought me in as a board member and also as the CEO. And of course, my passion is for innovation and continuous disruption.

    There was a business review article on Harvard Business Review on “Big Bang Disruptors,” and I consider myself a big bang disruptor. The first thing I did coming into the industry, even though we realized we had a very good traction in the market on the medical device side, is I carefully studied the challenges that the providers were facing at that particular time and what trends we were seeing ahead of us. Of course Meaningful Use was important in the Accountable Care Organizations, but the upcoming Affordable Care Act (this was about two years before the elections), I guessed that Obama was going to win at the time. I’m actually a Republican, but I still guessed that Obama was going to win and then I started really preparing, [by asking the question]: What would be the changes if the Affordable Care Act kicks in?  It was obvious that we were going to have more patients and we already had a shortage of caregivers, and the reimbursement rates were going to go down on the exchange, and private payers were going to try and match. That would mean providers were going to have to cut operating budgets. That was going to have a significant impact on innovation, and the only way to succeed is to look entirely at caregiver workflow—not only on the inpatient side, but also throughout the continuum of care.

    I went to Sequoia and asked for additional funding to be able to look at electronic medical record data, to be able to bring imaging, to connecting APIs for video and secure messaging and others, and really look more at a dashboard that could be displayed on a phone or it could be displayed on a tablet. But a dashboard that could provide an agnostic view of multiple data types, of multiple care settings, for multiple members of the care coordination team. Fortunately again, and I keep stressing that: You get the right investors that will support your continued innovation. At the same time Sequoia decided to support that vision. That same vision attracted other investors – the same kind like Qualcomm, WellcomeTrust, and investors like West Health.

    Another key for us is that a number of our pioneer customers, like Dignity Health, HCA, St. Joseph’s Healthcare, also decided to invest on that vision. If you look at founders, the right investors, right vision and understanding the trends, and the right customers that are willing to be the early adopters... the next thing you have to do is create a process, because you can not do it on your own. You can have a vision but you need to create a process and you need to create a culture in the company.

    The first thing that I did was to look at all the development, resources and initiatives that we had and divided the allocation of resources in two to three areas. 45% of everything we did was around core implementations, 40% were in adjacent developments, and 15% transformational.

    I was recently at a presentation from the CTO of Walgreens. He said that they enhance, evolve and explore. You enhance the core; you evolve into new adjacent markets; and you explore the next generation of transformation. We take the same approach, but I add percentages to that, knowing that eventually if you do your job right, you look at a four to five year period, most of your revenues will come from the 15% of transformational initiatives that you were doing five years ago and most likely your core is going to be 15% of your revenues today. So if you combine your core and adjacent, that’s about 85% of our revenues are from core and adjacent, which was reverse of how you put your resources. In my mind, that is a secret to continuing disruption. If you do it right, the formula always works.

    **Catalyze:** Wow. I’d never heard that before. It makes a lot of sense. That’s something that you put into place at AirStrip and it’s still in place?

    **Alan Portela:** Everything we do is that way. Of course today, our core is a combination of everything that we have done in the last five years, but I’m already looking at the transformational step, but of course, I’m putting 15% of our resources on that.

    **Catalyze:** I’m curious about this in the terms of timing. When you went to look for additional funding, and broadened this vision and went beyond medical devices, when you set the focus of the company on clinician workflow that was two to three years ago? Was that before AirStrip ONE and before the platform?

    **Alan Portela:** Immediately after I joined AirStrip four-and-a-half years ago, I started looking into this, and started looking at becoming a platform, for interoperability, care coordination and looking at all those multiple data types, I realized that the market was consolidating as part of the Affordable Care Act. The more healthcare organizations that hire others or collaborated with others, we were going to end up with a mess of systems of multiple systems. Mobilizing all those systems is mobilizing the mess. You are propagating the same challenge of lack of interoperability, so we needed to look at an agnostic, seamless, one view of all that data.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mwwnkxch9y" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** You touched on a topic that I think is incredibly relevant today and I know we talked about it a few times, but that’s interoperability, which is obviously a hot topic period. As systems consolidate and start to work with each other, and then payers start to work with systems, you are counting on clinicians have access to all of this data, interoperability becomes really more important.

    Interoperability is a huge topic and there have been a lot of things thrown around as potential solutions, or potential approaches may be a better way to put it. I’d be curious to get your impression on what true interoperability is and if we are moving towards that, or not with some of the current approaches.

    **Alan Portela:** If we go back to the trends that we saw five years ago when Meaningful Use was having a significant impact on the wide deployment of electronic health records, I have to give it to ONC for really coming up with that program. I have to also recognize that it was David J. Brailer under George Bush [currently CEO of Health Evolution Partners] that started that process, but he didn’t call it in Meaningful Use. So far, government had a significant role in this whole process, but what they did is to incentivize providers to really accelerate the implementation of all the EMRs. What happens is that as you do all that, with Accountable Care Organizations and the Affordable Care Act, we started really moving to a patient centric model from a hospital centric model on the reimbursement side, and from a fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement.

    Where we are missing the boat here is that now we tell are telling our physicians and our care coordination teams that they are going to be paid based on outcomes. Now that they are going to be paid based on outcomes, they need as much information as needed to be able to make the right decisions and that information has to be real-time. What we are doing is we provided the incentives, the hospitals implemented the EMRs – all the data now is automated, but now ONC recognizes that interoperability is important and all of the sudden they come up with a 10-year roadmap between 2014 and 2024 with 25 clinical data sets that are the ones that had to be shared. Some of those are: Do you smoke? Well, it’s very important to know if you smoke, but also it’s very important to have the medications that you are on. When you get admitted to a hospital, it’s important to know what medications you are on in real-time and we need to look at your vitals to make sure that we are doing the right treatment for the patient.

    We were starting to see ONC’s very relaxed timeline on how companies have to comply—the EHR companies have to comply with interoperability. Now it’s not really committing a sense of urgency, and we are slowly moving into that and the vendors feel that they are obligated to increase the level of interoperability. That is going to hurt decisions and eventually of course, it’s going to hurt patients.

    **Catalyze:** There certainly doesn’t seem to be much of a fire there, at this point for a lot of the vendors.

    **Alan Portela:** We were looking at core development, adjacent and transformational. For us, transformational four or five years ago, the adjacent business was to get additional data beyond medical devices. Transformational was to be able to clean that data, de-identify, but also to be able to standardize it, normalize it around clinical nomenclature and then eventually to start applying algorithms to be able to take that data and make our caregivers more proactive persons and reactive when it came to adverse events.

    Many analytics companies are coming in with a lot of very specialized algorithms to improve disease management and population health. With all that technology out there, we don’t have enough data available to us, because most of the vendors are siloing this data, because they have their market share.

    Elections are coming up in 18 months, this is the time where the existing government needs to make sure that they look again, as they are doing, at what is the roadmap and what is it that we can do to help those decisions to improve outcomes for all patients.

    **Catalyze:** You talked about four or five years ago that transformational bucket for cleansing data, mapping data and standardizing in terms of nomenclature. I imagine adding semantic meaning to data, by mapping things to some of the code sets that exist, which is a huge challenge.

    It’s interesting AirStrip started as a mobile app company that was a view for obstetricians for maternal heart rate monitoring, but has evolved into a data company. Is that an accurate perception of where you see AirStrip is today? Is that where you see AirStrip going in the future, in terms of additional data or services on top of that data?

    **Alan Portela:** I have to say it’s a pleasure always talking to you, because you understand what standardization is. You understand what semantic interoperability is, so it’s a pleasure to talk to someone who understands the challenges that we are dealing with.

    The key for us, from the beginning, was to work with customers. I have to mention the customer like Dignity Health. When I presented the vision on a whiteboard, and it was just a drawing about the platform and who we were becoming and that we were going to impact workflow, and innovate, the CIO Deanna Wise said, “If you can do that, that would be the Holy Grail, but it is a very big challenge.” She said, “I’m in; I’m willing to invest and be your first customer to bring the AirStrip One platform.”

    If it weren’t for people like Deanna Wise at Dignity, maybe others at HCA, or St. Joe’s, it would be impossible to get to where we are today. Providers are driving more innovation, and they are going to be the ones to force interoperability. If you look at who we are today, it’s very interesting, because about six months ago, we went through a big exercise as we are growing and growing, and serving our customers in different ways, we decided to create one sentence that will define who we are as a company. What is the product that we bring to the table? What is the problem that we are solving? And, the sentence is as follows: We are a mobile interoperability platform that enables care collaboration, and serves as a catalyst for customer innovation.

    To give you some examples, the mobile interoperability platform is everything that we do on medical devices, EMRs, bringing API integrations, structured and unstructured data all in one platform. They enable care collaboration. It’s all about existing workflows automation; it’s not about reinventing the wheel. It’s looking at what people are doing today and trying to bring technology to automate that particular workflow.

    A lot of people say well, you need to redesign workflows. Well, the big consulting firms have already done that for the last 10 years. Most of the hospitals today have the workflow analysis already assigned and already completed with clinical transformation. Now we just need to bring technology to automate those existing workflows.

    The third component of the sentence, “serving as a catalyst for customer innovation,” doesn’t mean that we are going to have to develop a lot of things. Sometimes, you go to a customer and you say, “What will make the biggest impact today for your care?” And they say, “Well we collaborate with a number of organizations in the country and we work on a number of NICU patients where we have other hospitals supporting us because they have the right level of expertise. If you can give me all the medical device connectivity, from my neonatal intensive care unit. If you can bring me the EMR data, specifically on the NICU real-time. If you can connect me with video, and also bring an API for images with agnostic quality and allow me to use third party secure messaging, you completely transform my life with the way we take care of babies.” That is part of our core functionality today. It was transformational four years ago.

    So, it’s really looking at how can we apply our mobile interoperability platform and visualization tools, because those apps, when you talk about applications four or five years ago, we call that visualization tools, because not only are we visualizing data from multiple systems, but now we are visualizing data that is produced from analytics engines, and it is data coming out real-time. Many analytics companies are collecting data that is retrospective, but real-time? You are going to see that it’s a big challenge.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/2ff8nqbez8" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** That is my second question, too. The analytics companies that you guys are talking to or working with, are they doing real-time analytics based on the data that you are pooling from devices, EHRs, and all these different sources?

    **Alan Portela:** Well, I always go back to the providers, because they are my customers. Providers are AirStrip’s customers and I think I learned this lesson from Judy Faulkner [founder and CEO of Epic Systems]. I try to work with those customers that have the right vision—the ones that really fit the profile of what we are trying to do—because they are the ones that are going to give us the right feedback on what our next transformational initiatives are. But also, they are going to be the ones that are going to work with the existing legacy vendors to make sure that we all collaborate. There are no frictions or overlaps.

    When I talk about working with a provider, I don’t get the data from the EHR. I don’t get the data from the medical devices. I provide the tools for those providers, so they can create with the use of our platform and visualization tool and the collaboration with their medical device and EHR vendors, then all of us can work in an ecosystem that works. Of course, some are open and some are not open on the vendor side, but you will see that in the next two years, since there are so many forces coming from the outside, that the providers are becoming so big from collaboration and consolidation that you will see that the vendors who will not open up, they are going to be history in the next 12 or 24 months.

    **Catalyze:** So you do see that shift coming in two years? We are pretty close to a tipping point where vendors have held a lot of that power and that’s enabled them to kind of keep those silos. So you clearly see this shift where providers now do have the say, or starting to have the say where they can go to whatever vendor it is to actually get data opened up?

    **Alan Portela:** Exactly. If you combine that, plus political forces on Affordable Care Act and the move to a value-based reimbursement... If you react to all of that, the fact that some EHR vendors, not only on the inpatient side, but, especially on the ambulatory side like the AthenaHealth’s of the world, many EHR vendors are starting to say, “We’re in.” And they are talking to those providers and they are saying, “I don’t want to be part of the problem, as you are consolidating. If you ever entertain placing everything with my solutions, I’m open. I want to be part of that transformation.” Even though EHRs have become a commodity, there’s going to be an opportunity for those vendors to sell more, basically taking the customer base of those that are not open. It’s going to open up again, even though [EHRs] are a commodity, because the ones that don’t open up, they are going to be history.

    **Catalyze:** They are going to lose their market share, and that’s a big opportunity. That makes sense and we have seen the same thing. You are just seeing it at much bigger systems than we are. So that’s good to hear, because I think everybody is anxious to see us hit that tipping point.

    **Alan Portela:** You see in the industry a number of organizations that are created around interoperability. But in my view, the moment you start combining vendors and providers, it could become very political—depends upon who is driving those organizations. There are some other groups that are being created that are just around providers. There is a group called the Center for Medical Interoperability. It was created a year ago; it’s based in Nashville. The goal is to first start with medical device interoperability, but look at the big picture. And it is just providers that they are getting together, realizing that they have a huge buying power and they can make a significant impact. We have to really look at all these different organizations out there and they are going to have probably one of the most important roles in the industry. But it is only those that are provider-centric that they come to all of us vendors and force us to open up.

    **Catalyze:** Another topic related to interoperability. Not sure if you want to touch on it or speak to it, because I know we talked previously, but I’m curious to get your take from an AirStrip perspective and maybe from broadly just your perspective in the industry on FHIR, the new standard, or emerging standard I should say, around interoperability and restful endpoints and things like that and to read EHR data. I’m curious to get your impression of it if you can share anything as to how AirStrip is looking at FHIR.

    **Alan Portela:** I think first of all they came out too quickly with the name. They should have called it SHIR as “slow healthcare interoperability resources.” I do believe that the “F” is for “fast,” but it doesn’t apply here.

    It’s aligned around what you see on the ONC roadmap. When you look at standards out there, on the ambulatory, you have CCDA, which is very limited data, but it’s enough for ambulatory information for historical data and then you have HL7 that most of the vendors support on administrative and ancillary data like lab results, with urology results, but very limited info on HL7.

    FHIR is a subset of what you have on HL7. It’s very promising, but there is limited data that you get. Probably you will get the same data that the ONC is requesting for 2017 that is 25 clinical data sets, but you are going to have only that data, and forget about the ability to write back into the data sources. What happens here is that FHIR is promising; it’s a slow healthcare interoperability resources standard, but knowing that we are moving to value-based reimbursement, I think that we owe it to the industry to realize that many of the top vendors have developed very strong Web services tools for their own customers to query the data, but they are not opening up the tools to the rest of the industry. We need to create a temporary layer that takes advantage of those strong tools that they have developed for all of us to collaborate on.

    **Catalyze:** We have similar views on FHIR and done some work with FHIR, as well and compared it to HL7 and CCDA and some of the other standards. And yes, there are significant limitations in FHIR. We look at it as not really a solution to interoperability, at least in the current definition of FHIR.

    **Catalyze:** Shifting gears a little bit. I want to talk about the AirStrip Innovation Marketplace. I am assuming it relates to that third piece of the sentence, talking about being a catalyst for your customers or providers, but could you talk a little about the Innovation Marketplace and the types of customers, or different groups, that you bring into that marketplace?

    **Alan Portela:** A while back I was reading a whitepaper from PriceWaterhouse. They call it “Owning the Disease.” The whole white paper was about creating platforms and an ecosystem of technologies, providers, payers, pharma – all around being able to support the management of a disease vertically. The moment we had our AirStrip ONE platform with integration and visualization tools—the moment we realized we could streamline and de-identify—it became apparent to us that what we needed to leverage from what we created at the beginning of the company. Look at what medical devices or sensors are going to exist on the ambulatory side that can produce those real-time waveforms so we can start monitoring patients with diabetes, heart conditions, COPD or high risk pregnancies outside of the hospital.

    We were very fortunate that about two-and-a-half years ago we received a methodology patent for re-rendering medical devices on mobile devices natively. So basically any device that produces a waveform, continuous waveform that requires a diagnostic quality, we have a patent for that, so we said, “If we can start looking at those specific clinical conditions or chronic disease – the reason that I make the distinction is that a clinical condition can be a high risk pregnancy and not a chronic condition, so if you look at diabetes, at heart failure, at COPD as chronic diseases and then, if you look at high risk pregnancy, we started saying if we move outside of the hospital and we pick the right sensors, what contextual data do we need as we need it on the inpatient side from activity monitors, blood pressure cuffs and scales, but also, what algorithms can we bring into this model, so we can start looking at the data that comes out of those devices, since we don’t have enough doctors to monitor these patients? We need to bring algorithms to help us to discern which are those patients that require special attention.

    I call it vertical integration into each disease or clinical condition. I realized that 15% of the transformational effort, it was a monumental task. I was feeling great when I was looking at interoperability and the things that we were doing, but this became monumental. I said to myself: Well, innovation has to come from the outside and with innovation I have to start tapping into academic medical centers, and other companies creating incredible tools and algorithms for disease management.

    The first one was MedStar Health in the area of Washington/Baltimore. They came to us and we developed a workflow algorithm for early detection of myocardial infarction for patients that are coming in an ambulance, so we can help the ED doctors to quickly determine if the patient coming in an ambulance has full blockage of the artery, rather than having to wait for the cardiologist on call. So we partnered with them, and we are working on taking those algorithms and visualizing them on top of our tools.

    Then we partnered with the University of Michigan. They developed algorithms for hemodynamic decompensation from grants that they received from NIH and the Army. They were doing studies for kids in Afghanistan that were hit with the shockwave of an IED and the internal bleeding. With the internal bleeding, they couldn’t detect if patients would have severe complications, but they came up with algorithms that would read waveforms so they could detect within 40 seconds if there is compensation; there is loss of blood and there is loss of plasma.

    We started realizing that there’s a world out there in the academic world that they are doing things that never go to market. We decided to create a translational business unit, so we could start look at body sensors. We could start looking at algorithms that now we can help those organizations to take to market, and of course come up with agreements that give them back royalty, because as we know, healthcare organizations need to figure out new ways of making money, because taking care of patients with Affordable Care Act is not going to be so profitable. You need to be able to take their translation to transformation. So I would say that my 15% of transformation is now divided on 60% is transformation and 40% is translational on initiatives coming from the academic world.

    **Catalyze:** Wow. I wasn’t aware that those were the types of marketplace partners, but that does make a ton of sense, because those academic centers have done a lot of this and I think they probably aren’t very good at commercializing it and probably not very good at finding ways to actually do the implementation with access to the data, especially in real-time.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mpetqcwopz" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Is there a listing of some of the participants in the innovation marketplace? Is that something you guys have created in terms of University of Michigan, MedStar, MD Anderson or whomever it might be?

    **Alan Portela:** At this point it is the University of Michigan and MedStar, but we are going to be talking to a number of others, other academic medical centers and definitely you will see the press releases as they come on. We are doing incredible things in both areas of body sensors and also on algorithms.

    **Catalyze:** Honestly, it’s fascinating to watch AirStrip evolve. The 15% transformational...you start to see it after following you guys for four or five years and you can kind of see these things coming now, or actually like you said, they are in place now.

    I want to be respectful of your time, Alan. I know you are a busy guy. Are there other specific things you want to cover in terms of innovation or funding or selling into large enterprises as a new or young company that we didn’t touch on?

    **Alan Portela:**  The key always as we mentioned is to continuously disrupt yourself; that’s very important, but also to recognize that in any company you get to a point where you need to bring resources from the outside to help you on your vision and to help the internal team – the previous team to go to the next level. And that’s what we did at AirStrip. We built an incredible team of innovators and people that are very strong on executing on innovation. It created a whole culture where everybody rose to the occasion.

    It’s always the combination of the right investors upfront, of course the right mission and vision, the right customers that are willing to innovate with you and invest in your company, and of course the team. The team that you put together and how you educate your own team to get into this new innovation culture is very important. So, I just wanted to deliver that message.

    **Catalyze:** Alan, thank you for your time. I may follow up with you separately to talk about some of the stuff we talked about previously. I’d totally forgotten in terms of sales, building a sales organization and your thoughts around that, but in terms of this, I really do appreciate this, Alan; this is super helpful.

    We’ve interviewed some CIOs and some Chief Innovation Officers at large centers and we really wanted to bring in the vendor, start-up, entrepreneur perspective, and you, obviously, were right at the top of our list, so we really appreciate you taking the time.

    **Alan Portela:** Well, thank you, and one more comment that I wanted to make is that I’ve been in healthcare for 22 years, and healthcare IT and this is the first time, thanks to programs like this, where we are able to deliver our ideas and the message of what we are doing. This is the first time that I’m getting the calls from those CEOs, Chief Innovation Officers, from organizations that are not even customers and they call me and they say, “I want to be your partner. We have some ideas, and we want to be your partner.” So I’m having fun. This is actually the best time in my professional career and even though we are in a difficult moment in healthcare, I think that if we all played right that this is going to be very exciting.

    **Catalyze:** That’s great. Alan, you are one of the really good guys that I’ve met in the industry, so I’m very happy for you to hear that this is such a great time for you. Glad to hear that AirStrip continues to do so well.

    **Alan Portela:**  Thank you. Take care.

  :summary: Dr. Guerra is co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of iTriage, but also
    an emergency physician and university lecturer on the topic of innovation. He
    joined us today to talk about ways to introduce your startup to healthcare organizations,
    culminating in a fantastic story about iTriage's origins. This is an interview
    you can't miss if you have ever wondered the best ways to sell into healthcare.
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Within healthcare, potentially the most important plan of all the plans you'll make is how you intend to create awareness among large health institutions. Get the word out!
    2. Healthcare still has a lot of inefficiency and waste, so there is constant fertile opportunity for innovation. Chances are the idea is smart, but what matters is how you go about introducing that idea to healthcare institutions.
    3. Always think how your startup will affect the 3 P's: Patient, Provider, and Payor.

    **Catalyze**: I'm really excited to have you on and talk to you. Before I even jump into the question, as an entrepreneur in healthcare, thank you for iTriage. It really has paved the way and set an example for everyone else to show the value of mobile technology in healthcare whether on the clinical or patient side. Again congrats, and thank you for iTriage.

    **Dr. Guerra**: Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to our conversation.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/5t5xcv8uut" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: We'll start with general disruption. You've been in the industry for many years, for 20 years. Bringing disruption to your own industry can be very, very challenging. You guys did it with iTriage and changed the way that patients were able to access care, and then the way that providers and systems were able to actually expose different services and care options to patients more directly. What do you think was the major difference for iTriage that enabled them to have such disruption and really pretty quickly?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I think, in general, healthcare is really complex. My other co-founder, Peter Hudson, also an emergency physician, we've both been involved with actually taking care of patients, for over 20 years. I think on one business trip we added how many patients we've actually seen; it's over 50,000 that we've taken care off. We understood consumers and the patients really, really well. We call them the three Ps, the patients, the providers, and the payors. We also understood the clinical side, being hospital-based physicians working within hospitals.

    We were both involved in different business aspects of medicine our entire lives. Going to meetings, seeing what the hospital is struggling with, talking to other providers: the specialty providers, orthopedic surgeons, dermatologists, things like that, and seeing what they're struggling with. We had some experience with the payors, mostly in contracting, but that expanded the knowledge. I think part of the success was that we had a deep understanding of the industry. We had at least a reasonable understanding what payors wanted and then a deep understanding of also what providers needed.

    I think we were trying to create a product that benefited all three of those Ps. Being physicians, we knew that if we could aggregate enough users—getting enough downloads, getting enough people who are interested in using it on a daily basis, the business model would evolve, and especially if we were benefitting the other two Ps as well [providers and payors].

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/oa0rrb1at8" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: Looking specifically at iTriage, do you think it's easier to innovate from the inside or is disruption generally much easier and really have to come from the outside an industry?

    **Dr. Guerra**: If you are a consumer-based product, and certainly we're all healthcare consumers, developing that sort of mental mindset of  why it is so difficult to get this product or service out of the healthcare industry is critical. If it's a primarily consumer-facing product, then having someone outside of the industry that really is suffering alongside the users, trying to achieve those things is important.

    I think you're going to see some barriers erected or at least some difficulties when you try to get that integrated into the actual industry. If you don't understand the work flows and the incentives of the providers and the payors, it's going to be tough to get broader adoption. You're starting to see some movement where consumers can push a lot of things and get change within the industry, but it's going to be slow going if you can't benefit those other two Ps – providers and payors, and just understanding those work flows.

    I hear about new products because I do a lot of advising of new companies and start-ups. Whenever I hear that all a doctor has to do is open up this web app, I immediately think it's [not going to work]. One more piece of technology that's not integrated into the doctor's work flow, into their practice management system or their EHR, it's going to be a struggle. Even though it seems conceptually easy, it's going to be tough for providers to do that.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/afd1sisdpa" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: Specifically looking at what you lecture on as a professor now, when you think about enterprises, why do you think they need to look beyond simple incremental innovation in healthcare?

    **Dr. Guerra**: You just think about the incentive models, how much they've changed over the last five years, it's really upending the entire organization. I remember Mark Bertolini, the CEO of Aetna, stating that their entire business model has been changed when they had new medical loss ratios that were requirements. And saying that he wanted to become a health information technology company that allowed providers to assume risk. Years ago, if I was a CEO of a health system, it was all about driving the greatest number of patients to my system and delivering that at the highest margin.

    Well, that's no longer the workflow. You just think about the 30-day readmission penalty. Well, in the old model doctors always had patients' interests at heart, but if I discharged someone a little early, and they didn't understand their discharge instructions, they couldn't get their prescriptions filled, they came back two days later and were re-admitted. I discharged them with pneumonia, they stayed in the hospital for a few days, then they would have to come back and be readmitted.

    Well, in the old model, I actually may have received extra revenue for that, right? While I'm not going to obviously do that on purpose, there wasn't a huge disincentive besides having to go through risk management and quality assurance and discuss why the patient didn't succeed at home. But in the new incentive model if the hospital isn't going to get paid for that admission, now you are seeing all transitions at care to make sure the patient goes home with the prescription, simple things, but these are all the psycho-social things that create failures in the delivery model.

    When you change incentives, it drives more than just incremental innovations, it's driving disruptive innovations. I think in large organizations, they are going to be looking for more and more ways to disrupt the way they do things because their whole business model has been disrupted.

    **Catalyze**: You touched on a topic there I wanted to ask you about. In our last Innovation Series interview, we talked to Dr. Marc Chasin about innovators coming into healthcare or start-ups in healthcare. We asked if he had any advice for selling to a health system. It was interesting to see that because what you talked about is understanding that there is the shift and it is coming to healthcare where the business models are totally getting flipped on their head and were going from volume to value. He also talked about that transition happening over time, and start-ups and technology vendors or technology-enabled service vendors looking at ways that they can potentially appeal to both sides of the system or both stages of the system, if you will. I am curious to get your thoughts on that?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I think it's very relevant because hospitals run on a very, very small margin. When you look at the overall revenue, especially as a small company, you are thinking, ah, it's massive, the health system is so big. But then when you really look at their margin being low single-digit... they don't have a lot of opportunity to invest heavily in something that might fail. If you can show some short-term results, but then, hey, in the long game, you're going to be very effective as well. That's obviously the best. You are feeding both of those needs.

    Before I left iTriage, we were starting to do this. Some of our bigger health systems that had partnered with us for the last three or four years were definitely seeing net new patients come to their doctors and their facilities, not just the ER, but their outpatient facilities, radiology facilities, all those, because the person used iTriage to find the hospital.

    We started creating an ability to have a log-in that would allow a patient, who is maybe also a part of their accountable care organization, to then sign-in into the general public application and then the application converted and had more tools to help the patient manage at a higher cost and lower—or higher quality and lower cost initiatives. Connecting with their doctors, being able to not just make appointments, but also even being able to start communicating with them.

    That's the direction that we now see it's taking—sort of that fee-for-service model, still bringing value to the fee-for-service model, but then also being able to deliver some tools in an accountable care organization or a primary care medical home, and helping that same sort of use of the application with a log-in that now has some different features. I think if new companies can do that, straddle that appropriately and navigate that, then all will benefit. Because if you don't show an ROI until three years down the line, it's going to be tough for a system to be able to invest in.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/0h11vuad3u" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: How do you gauge the size of market when some of these markets are still kind of being defined, everybody talks about healthcare being whatever, a $2.3 trillion, $2.7 trillion industry. But when you look at something like appointments, or whatever it might be, how do you go about gauging the size of that market or advise people in terms of how they gauge the size of that market?

    **Dr. Guerra**: People always ask "Is your new venture going be in healthcare?" I say absolutely, there's so much inefficiency. If it's $2.1 trillion, $2.7 trillion, a third is wasted. It's unfathomable. Getting back to iTriage, we experienced every day those 50,000 patients that we visited, but about 30% to 40% of all emergency department visits could go to a lower level of care with the same quality of healthcare delivered. They can go to an urgent care, retail clinic or a doctor.

    There's 135 million to 140 million ER visits a year now. If you have an ankle sprain and you go to an ER versus a lower level of care, the cost of that is somewhere between $600 and $900. You start doing the math, that is tens of billions of dollars wasted for this one problem, redirecting emergency department visits to the appropriate level of care. That's how we kind of define a market and that's how I ask new companies that are looking at this. I say, "Let's outline your problem and try to get as many facts around the problem to define that market, so you can actually size it and see how big the opportunity is." That's  super important especially when you're trying to raise capital especially after the C round, you're trying to get the series A.

    Also, how does your solution solve that problem? For us, it was pretty clear. A patient opens up the iTriage app. They think they have a cough, so they click on that. They think, oh, it sounds like bronchitis, because I don't feel that sick. Then they see that they have these opportunities besides going to an ER. They can choose an urgent care, retail clinic, and then iTriage makes it really easy to connect with them. That's a great pathway that we could describe over and over and over again. I think for any brandnew company that's trying to size their market, they should look at what the problem is, make sure it's big enough. You don't have to solve all the problems because healthcare in some ways is screwed up; you can take a small portion of that problem and still be a very effective and have a profitable business.

    **Catalyze**: If you're advising somebody who is sort of pre-idea or looking to get into healthcare, are there specific areas or buckets that you see as particularly interesting to target right now over the next 12 to 24 months?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I would go back to what was always successful for us. When we first started iTriage and drew the concept on the back of a napkin, there were 8 million iPhones in the world, 8 million. But we knew these devices were really uses of the technology. I don't know if you remember the first time you downloaded an application and it worked 30 seconds after you opened it. It was an amazingly efficient delivery of software. We just knew that these things were so compelling—these devices were going to be broadly adopted. And then Android came six months later and brought down the price point for these devices.

    I would recommend that people look at the tailwinds. What are the market trends that you think are going to happen? You've already touched on some of them, bundled payments, absolutely. The ability to help providers deliver care more effectively and efficiently and also kind of longitudinally. It's not just about before I need the procedure and now when I need the procedure, but post procedure, because the post procedure problems transition when you go home. That's causing a lot of the extra cost when you have to come back to the ER or maybe even get re-admitted. All kinds of models there are improving that delivery of care. I love that. I love the information from patients.

    You're seeing a lot of this now. The technology is getting less and less expensive. For example, if I need to send you home with a heart problem, I can put a sticker on you and monitor your pulse and temperature for the next two weeks. That's very inexpensive technology and now I can see on a continual basis through algorithms this data coming to a central repository. Now one nurse can take care of 30, 40 patients in their home versus a home health nurse that can only take care of three or five a day. Technology is magnifying the capabilities of the providers, but also able to find problems much earlier at the proximal phase of the illness or a complication and treat those before they become major problems under re-admission. I love that space.

    There is about $765 billion being wasted. There's still a huge percentage of people that are getting the wrong procedures, or getting procedures that they don't need. Technologies are managing that and connecting the patient with a symptom to the right provider. Again, I still love that space as well. Now, we can focus on emergency medicine in the acute care setting that we understand the most. But there's still a huge need for that. One example is back pain. If you get to the wrong provider, you're going to probably have a back surgery. There's a lot of literature saying you probably don't need that back surgery, thus an increased cost for the system, increased risk and cost for the patient. Being able to get more efficient with those patient work flows and delivering care more efficiently, love those themes.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/8ax5plbtlx" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: If you were advising a start-up on how they could  sign or work with a big provider like HCA or getting more integrated into ONC and HHS, what your advice would be for them?

    **Dr. Guerra**: We were very deliberate at iTriage. Actually it was Peter Hudson's original idea...

    He called me on my birthday and said, "We've been talking about inefficient health careers and I just shut down something I was doing..." He sits up and he starts drawing on the back of a napkin. After 45 minutes of discussion drove down to a bank and started our business. It was one of those banks, wasn't a real bank, it was a bank in one of the grocery stores, a Safeway grocery store. We had some seed money and opened a bank account there and started our business.

    Five months later, we had our first application in the app store. That was great and I thought _This is awesome_. Guess what? First day—10 downloads and all those were friends and family; second day—20 downloads; third day—15 downloads. We thought it was going to go viral; we thought it was going to be super cool that it was just going to take off on its own. But healthcare was not cool. I suspect there is no virality in healthcare. So we were very, very deliberate in getting our first referenced customers.

    Again, this goes back to our original discussion about being deeply involved in healthcare. Centura was our first customer. Centura is the largest employer here in Colorado. They have 13 hospitals, and we worked in their hospitals emergency departments, so we had access to their CEO's and to their management. We showed it to them, and they said, "We love this." We created very low barriers for them to participate. We never did anything for free, but we created very low barriers to get them to participate. That was our first referenced customer. We then signed on Sutter and then HCA right after that. Here we have three major large health systems both for profit and non-profit involved in the application, which gave us great credibility.

    The government outreach was very, very deliberate. We first reached governor, excuse me, Senator Bennet on a soccer field. Our VP of Business Development and Senator Bennet's son were both on the same team. He just showed it to him. He showed him, "Hey here's the application, this is what we're doing." And it resonated with the themes that Senator Bennet was interested in—lower cost, higher quality, patient empowerment, consumer engagement, and he said you need to meet Aneesh Chopra. Aneesh Chopra was at that time the CTO of the White House. Initially, well, Aneesh wasn't that excited about what we were doing, but then he saw the real ER wait times. He went crazy and said, oh this is awesome, you guys have to meet Todd Park, and then Todd Park was trying to develop the open data initiative, and we became the first poster child for that whole initiative, but it was very, very deliberate.

    When you think about disruptive innovations, there are really more marketing challenges than they are technology problems, right? I mean, disrupted technologies are a mash up of technologies that already exist and then applied to a different problem that no one has ever applied to them before. Getting people to know about it, that's the tough part. It takes a deliberate constant effort. It's that Jim Collins Flywheel, you start getting it's just barely moving then it kind of become virtual as it starts to move the momentum, gets it to continued move, but there was a huge outreach for us. So I think, yeah, being very, very deliberate about both those endeavors as important.

    Then again getting back to HCA with our larger health systems, we gave them exclusivity in certain areas for a very fine period of time that allowed them to adopt the app almost as their own. And some of our larger health systems, well they would do radio spots, TV spots, put up bill boards to download iTriage, they'd send fliers and mailers out to their community, because they loved the theme of it: that a patient or a user or a member of the community would have this in their hand and would make better healthcare decisions. They wanted to be associated with that. Obviously, they had some downstream increased deeper service reasons as well, but they like the other subjective things. Those were spot on and very deliberate. We were happy enough to be and lucky enough to be successful on those endeavors.

    **Catalyze**: I'm assuming as an ER doc in Colorado you guys had some access at Centura for those first meetings and first customers, is that correct? How do you get to the point where you're pitching to HCA? I'm curious how you sort of make those leaps?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I was on a shift. We had just gotten the prototype for iTriage. I saw the CEO walk by at the hospital, and said, "Hey Ken, I am working on this really cool thing, I'd like to show it to you." He responded, "Oh! Come right after your shift. What time do you finish?" I said, "4:30". So I come by and showed him, and it was awesome. The first thing he says is, "Can I invest?" He was willing to take risks. He likely had a higher margin hospital, so he was able to take some risks and then introduced us to Centura, which was also doing well at the time, and interested in reaching out to their community. They are really far reaching or far thinking and knew that the delivery of healthcare was going to change. They needed to be on the mobile bandwagon; they needed to reach out to their customers.

    The Sutter thing was really interesting, as well. Centura was awesome. They said, "Hey we have a Sutter team coming in to talk to us about all the different things that we're doing, and we're just going to be sharing information with Sutter and we'd love you to present iTriage." I was like, "Yeah, that's awesome, that's it." So Pete wasn't able to do it, so I got my suit on and everything and it's about a 30-person board room, I'm seated at the podium, ready to go, and two people walk in, one from Centura, and another person was Kerry Jeffords, at the time from Sutter. I thought we're going to have a whole room, that's going to be the team, and it turned out just to be Kerry from Sutter. I said, "Well this is kind of stupid for me to be at the podium, let me come down and show you what we're doing. And Kerry kept her cards close to her chest and didn't really say much. She said that's interesting, but she really liked it. She pitched it to Sutter and asked us to come out and do a broader pitch and that's how we got introduced to Sutter. Tons of stories like that, it just comes from—if you're an entrepreneur, you should always be excited about talking about your product and trying to network with people, because you just never know which one is going to... which conversation is going to be the most fruitful, and lead to either a great customer or a great introduction or even with a killer product, and that's going to get you to the next level.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/8r9qi4k6o0" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: Do you think a lot of the disruptive innovation and a lot of the technologies which kind of enable these big shifts in healthcare, you think they are going to come from a mix of the enterprises and the small vendors, or do you think it's going to come from predominantly one or the other? I'd be curious as you sort of engage and probably have pretty good insight where you think that's going to come from?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I think it's still going to be the smaller companies that are outlining the problem and then developing a really unique solution and then grow from there.

    I think it's just really, really hard for large enterprises to do—to go beyond sustaining innovations and be really disruptive. It requires an incredible discipline from the top leadership of finance, they must create enough time for the team to be able to evolve their product, and then you must give them room to fail, which is not a word that you usually use when you're at a larger organization, but that's the process that you use, right? You must innovate inexpensively as possible, so that means you're not doing market research. Large corporations loved bringing consultants in to do all this market research, so they feel comfortable with making their decision; we saw that happen. Many times we're like, "Hey, give us the quarter million dollars and we're going to build the feature that we think people are going to need."

    Creating commitment, enough time to succeed, creating different metrics. If you're an intrapreneur within a company, your whole business plan should be about learning. Creating a product, it's okay to fail. But what you're going to learn from that and how you're going to redeploy as soon as possible to get to whatever you're trying to solve.

    The core organization has different metrics of success that you just can't measure for the intrapreneur that's trying to do something disruptive. You need to protect that team from the core. It's those processes and then finally setting up the right incentives. You have to create that environment. Very few companies that have that discipline to do that.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/e6vw4fc4n7" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: Are there certain areas of healthcare to potentially get investment from an investor or a large fund? And if you have any specific advice for small companies, how should they would go about fund raising and raising money?

    **Dr. Guerra**: You're exactly right about the entire investor community. It's just different. If you think about 2009-2010, the whole financial crisis that's so prevalent even though you're making an investment that probably won't exit for three to five years, the current IPO market, the current valuations affect greatly the decisions you make right now. It kind of doesn't really make sense, but that's just the way it's always been and the way it is. The valuations are way higher now than they were back in 2009, 2010, and 2011. That's great for new companies.

    I think it depends on who you're going after as the buyer. If this is surely a consumer play, I'm usually pretty resistant that consumers just don't want to pay for services; they get so much for free. It's tough. In healthcare, it's been a challenge to get people to do that in a significant way. I worry about that. I think you have to involve the consumer, but I go after the other two Ps [provider and payor]. If it's the provider side, then you got to remember that you either have to focus your product or service on increasing quality and decreasing cost, and then if you can show an ROI within 18 to 24 months, that's about all they are going to project out, and it's just really, really tough to do. To go beyond that, again, because the margin has been so low.

    On the payor side, there is still a lot of interest and again it's the same theme of the triple aim, it's improving the consumer experience, it's decreasing cost, and increasing quality. It seems easy to say, and obviously it's complex, but if you have tools to do that for a segment of their population then they would be willing to try that.

    I love you mentioned pilots earlier, that's a great way to get started, and you get some initial traction in proving that your product actually does do what it you say it does in an environment that's a real life environment of patients actually trying to get care and get well. I think that's the move there that you need to focus on.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/im1k5qowmd" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze**: Those are great points about investment. The really good thing for entrepreneurs whether they were coming from within healthcare, like you and Peter, or coming from outside of healthcare, is that the investment community has changed considerably. We're starting to see digital health is a trend that big, big venture funds are heavily looking at and now starting to invest in. That's an incredibly positive thing.

    Well, Wayne, I mean this has been fantastic. I mean, honestly I'm racking my brain for something more to ask. I don't really have anything else for you. Are there any other topics that you think you would like to touch on and like to dig a little bit deeper into, anything at all?

    **Dr. Guerra**: I'd just like to reiterate that if you truly have something disruptive then you need to have a plan of how you're going to tell the world, because it has to be focused and disciplined. Keep analytics on it and you got to have a better plan for that. You know unfortunately healthcare is just not that cool and it's really, really tough to get just naturally the spread. And if you can focus on, especially if you have a great consumer facing product, and even if it's super beneficial to people, they will use it and keep it and tell their friends about it, but you still have to have that focus on more opinion from PR outreach. That's what I would like to reiterate.

    **Catalyze**: That's something you touched on before. My interpretation of our talk so far is that going out and intentionally finding those reference customers and finding organizations like the OMC or HHS that you can partner and co-market with.

    **Wayne Guerra**: We at least talk about finding like-minded people. We developed for a market of people that would most likely benefit from iTriage, busy moms that have become the CFOs of their families who are making more than 80% of the healthcare decisions. We reached out to mommy bloggers, both paid and non-paid and get them to write about us, talk about us. We talked to business travelers, because we saw huge value for a business traveler who is now in a foreign city and they have an earache, they only need an emergency care, but how they're going to find one easily. Simple things like that and then likeminded organizations like the ONC and HHS, what they are trying to do, and finding things that they are interested in.

    It's really about crafting a message to the constituent, taking more partners and focusing on the attributes that would be most interesting to them, and getting them to partner with you. You have to have money set aside for that, because you need people to bring that, but it is super fun as well because you get to meet, network and collaborate on some really good initiatives.

    **Catalyze**: As you are passionate about your product, it enables you to talk about it, and find ways to work with other people or partner with people on the thing that you're passion about.

    I don't really have anything else, Wayne, other than a thank you for your time and insight. This has been incredibly valuable.

    **Wayne Guerra**: Thanks for having me.

  :summary: Joel Vengco from Baystate Health joined us from the TechSpring facilities
    to talk about the many ways of bringing external innovation into a health system.
    This interview is jam-packed with a bountiful number of knowledge soundbites geared
    towards startups. Listen in to understand how Baystate sources, pilots, evaluates,
    and implements new ideas. What an interview!
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Know the strategic initiatives of the health system in which you are selling into. Align your idea with their problems!
    2. Consumers now expect the experiences they have in retails etc.
    3. The most important criteria to get into Baystate is to have an organizational or clinical champion.

    **Catalyze:** We are here today with a new interview as part of our Innovation Series. We have Joel Vengco, CIO and VP of Information Technology at Baystate. Previously, he was at GE and has a pretty deep background in healthcare and healthcare technology and healthcare innovation, which we are going to talk about today. Thank you so much for joining us Joel; we really do appreciate it.

    **Mr. Vengco:** It’s really my pleasure, Travis. Thanks for inviting me.

    **Catalyze:** Excited to talk to you because you guys are really doing some interesting things at Baystate. We’ll get into some of the details here in a second. I want to start by talking a little bit about startups, and your experience about what you’ve seen. Can you give some specific examples of companies coming into healthcare, specifically healthcare technology that have done really well and been effective, and maybe an example or two of things that have not been done well.

    **Mr. Vengco:** Sure. I think a core piece that a startup should know when they go in to engage with a healthcare organization like Baystate, particularly the size of Baystate, is what are the problems that Baystate has an organization? What are the problems that organizations like Baystate are trying to solve?

    Additionally, many startups that have successfully engaged with us identify those areas that some of our incumbent technologies aren’t nimble enough to address. They’ve identified the incumbent EHR we have today or the incumbent ERP system and they’ve said, “Well, they can’t do things like predictive modeling on which patients are appropriate to be seen by which providers, because that wasn’t what they were built to do. They have done a nice job at identifying the gaps that we have as a healthcare institution and in the practice and the technology that we have. That’s really what caught our attention and in many cases, we have worked with those startups and even connected them with some of our incumbent technologies and created partnerships there after.

    **Catalyze:** Interesting. So coming in with a sense of what you guys are actually running and maybe what gaps are with those incumbent technologies and looking forward to where healthcare is going are things that companies can do right.

    **Mr. Vengco:** Without a doubt, because there are so many ideas. Ideas are a dime a dozen, so it could be really profound and you are like, “Wow, we should do an OpenTable for Healthcare.” While [OpenTable for healthcare] is really a good idea, that may not be a practical idea.

    (And, by the way, that example is a great practical idea – access to a physician’s schedule by a patient or a consumer is absolutely the right way to go. But that’s one of those ideas where it makes a lot of sense, but there may be another thing like a Yelp or some other paradigm that we’ve seen in other industries that may be a great idea in other industries but not necessarily solve an immediate problem for healthcare institutions today.)

    **Catalyze:** That’s a good point and I guess the news for OpenTable for Healthcare is the reason for the recent funding for ZocDoc, now that they are getting as large as they are getting.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/cctq5coz01" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="302"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** On a similar topic – you are at TechSpring right now, and presumably it is actually within the organization – the space is actually physically pretty close to Baystate office space. Is that correct?

    **Mr. Vengco:** That’s correct, and that’s by design actually. Part of the reason why I developed TechSpring was not just to find the latest and greatest startup. Really it was because of a couple of pillars.

    One is we wanted to crowd source innovation and find innovators and encourage large companies to come into a space that’s inside of the healthcare organism. So be InVivo when you are developing solutions for problems that we already know exist. Rather than doing it in a corn silo off sight in Kansas City or in Wisconsin, the real sort of invitation was: Come here to Baystate. Be close to our clinicians. Be close to our administrators. Be inside the belly of the beast and help develop solutions that we see everyday and maybe you can even find and solve problems that we have not even yet begun to solve and help solve them because you are inside the environment.

    **Catalyze:** In looking at the TechSpring website and reading about it a little bit, it seems to be the focus and the value for companies coming in, and for Baystate, too, is to actually get them engaged and working within the health system and working within the clinical workflow, operation, or whatever that workflow might be as a pilot and actually start collecting data and testing things out in a real world setting.

    **Mr. Vengco:** That’s exactly right and I think that’s the differentiator that we’re posing to those that are doing things like the traditional incubators or accelerators. Those are great. I think a RockHealth and those types of incubators are tremendous assets to our industry. The difference that we are putting out there is that, “Hey, let’s have you guys come and partner with a health system that may be in a model environment and a model state and also have you be inside of the fray of the organization and the organism, so you can see what’s going on, on a day-to-day basis, and then not just work with the clinicians or the administrators at Baystate, but also with other technology firms who may be part of the Baystate environment, or the regional environment.” There’s that notion of community collision and crowd sourcing of innovation – that’s what we want to try to do, and do it inside the belly of the beast.

    **Catalyze:** I would agree with you completely – other incubators are great, but being able to do it within an organization is a very practical win for a new company, because it’s all about getting a pilot and showing data, based on your OpenTable for Healthcare or whatever it might be.

    **Mr. Vengco:** It’s a really nice environment for those types of companies that are trying to innovate, because you have a bi-directional connect and those that will ultimately be using your product.

    When I was at GE, the thing that I desired the most, as the Vice President of this organization that managed many of their innovative products, was I wished I’d had a partnering organization that was in my backyard, or that I was in their backyard. On top of that, I wish I had an organization that I could also partner with to impact the region or that sort of community that they were servicing, because that is also a large part of healthcare. It’s not just what happens in the hospital, it’s also what happens in the region that hospital or health system services.

    Part of what I saw in bringing TechSpring here was that we could not only allow the doors to be open for innovators to come in and be part of the health system, but they also become part of the community, in such a way where I do believe the microcosms that we see are broadly or more pervasively applicable to the larger inner healthcare industry. I think that’s an important component of what we are building and what we have built at TechSpring.

    **Catalyze:** To me, it’s very intriguing as a company, and you talk about some of the profiles of the companies that you work with, whether it’s a new company or a venture  outside of healthcare that is bringing something to healthcare. It seems like a fantastic avenue, if you can get in and participate.

    **Catalyze:** When you set up pilots or assess an internal tool or technology, can you talk through how you set up what outcomes you are actually for, and is it based on the stage of the company? How you go about doing that so you really get a clear picture when that pilot is done. Like, do we want to take this to scale? Do we want take this regionally? How do you guys set that up from the beginning?

    **Mr. Vengco:** That’s a great question. An important part of this is we select the mid-to-late stage startups, because right now we don’t really dabble in early-stage startups, because there’s not a lot of capital that we are currently investing in the class or the pool, if you will, to engage with us. A lot of it is that organization coming in and investing their time and some capital to engage with Baystate.

    The focus for us is to identify those startups or businesses that are providing solutions that meet our strategic objectives as a health system. The idea is many health systems share strategic objectives, whether it is value-based purchasing, or patient engagement or quality and safety functionalities or capabilities, or perhaps even regulatory requirements, so there are many things that we share as health systems.

    These are the pillars that we put up there and say, “Of these problems that we have identified or these strategic objectives that we’ve identified – who is going to create solutions for those problems? How do we better engage our patients?" We look for startups or solutions that can help us solve that problem.

    Then we wrap metrics based on our own strategic objective metrics around a pilot with those startups. For example, let’s say our patient engagement strategy calls for better access; i.e. improve the accessibility of your physicians so that in 24 hours, the patient can have access to an appointment, rather than the next three days, or the next three weeks, which is typically the case. We use that as a measure of – did the pilot go out and actually decrease the wait times, or via the next appointment time for that patient? Many of the metrics are there based on what we believe is the success criteria that’s going to be for the strategic objectives. That is a pretty straightforward way of taking what we have in operations and identifying them for these innovators to try to address or achieve.

    **Catalyze:** That makes a lot of sense; it’s aligned with exactly what you guys are trying to accomplish as an organization.

    **Mr. Vengco:** Many of the things that we have as strategic objectives are often process and people focused. Technology can help us automate some of those things. Innovators come in and say, “You know, you really don’t need a team to do better access for patients. Maybe you need a different technology or a different process and technology, and we believe we can do that for you, and we believe we can impact those metrics for you.” That’s when we have that kind of engagement with those innovators.

    **Catalyze:** Two questions came out of what you were just saying. The first is, at a high level what are those strategic initiatives that you are hoping that TechSpring might outsource some of the innovation to help you guys with those initiatives?

    **Mr. Vengco:** These days there are so many strategic objectives. We laugh because you should really only have a handful, but because of what we are forced to do we end up having four plus another 20 underneath it.

    Having said that, patient engagement is absolutely one of the tops for us, so that’s one big deal for us. Also the delivery of care and the delivery of care models are a huge focus for us, and that includes population health, management of digital delivery of care. We are also very focused on giving our patients or consumers high value care and that has everything to do with healthcare reform obviously, in terms of the expense of care delivered and so I’d say those are a few of our big strategic objectives that we have.

    We also, of course, want to make sure we are focusing on research. We are an academic medical center, and so academics are a big part of our tradition and that also helps us progress as we deliver care and innovate on clinical care for our regions. Those are a few things that we are really focused on, but patient engagement, patient experience – that’s a big deal and we really are looking at many different types of technologies and innovators to help us with that part.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/xxmood8q57" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="302"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Patient engagement is obviously a huge topic and it’s a topic that we’ve talked with several individuals on these interviews – most recently with Simon Jones of Blue Shield of California and he was talking about that there is no one-size-fits-all solution or there is not going to be one-size-fits-all solution for patient engagement. The division of patients is so varied in terms of what they are looking for and the ways they are looking to be engaged and the types of things that will keep them engaged, whether that be social, financial, or whatever it might be – competition. And so, I’d be curious if you guys have had any early lessons learned – things that you’ve found to be effective and specific tools that you guys are leveraging to engage patients are to go about engaging patients.

    **Mr. Vengco:** I couldn’t agree more. I think we are in a world where consumers expect that there’s going to be a sort of a personalization the way they are going to get engaged by any market player, whether it’s in healthcare or in retail.

    In fact, we are so used to retail and the ways that all other industries are engaging with us that we are going to expect that more and more from healthcare. The biggest lesson that we’ve learned is that the patient portal is not an engaging tool. I’m just so happy that we got past that whole Meaningful Use mumbo jumbo. That was just a useless target, honestly, right? Patient portals are just billboards that don’t really gain anything for patients. That’s not engagement.

    As I like to tell the story, you can only tell someone they're fat once and they're not going to come back. You want to make sure that they have ways to take action on that, maybe get competitive and do something about their condition, so the patient portal is a vehicle for us. We actually call it the patient engagement platform, because the portal in its first phase is not where we want to end up. We don’t want to just be a billboard. We want to have a landing space for patients to do a number of things.

    We are starting to pilot e-Visits for them, using the patient portal. We are targeting a variety of different service types, whether its pharmacy education to therapy to speech pathology to behavioral health and also primary care, so we are using our engagement portal to have that kind of e-Visit capability. We are also using that to provide them with an app store at Baystate, which is an evolution and still growing, but this is addressing that topic that you just mentioned about not one-size-fits-all, right? So, how many different apps and functions can we give patients to choose from so they can view their data, engage with us in different ways, maybe schedule appointments, refill their prescriptions. Believe it or not, they want to refill their prescriptions in different ways. Some of them want to use a refill request. Some of them want to use apps. Some of them want to use a phone call, so we want to give them very different ways to do this.

    We want to be a service provider that is convenient for these patients, because it’s going to be about convenience. You’ve got the CVSs, Walmarts, and Walgreen’s of the world. They are going to become more convenient than we are and in order to really engage our patients and get loyalty, we have to do better. One-size-does-not-fit-all, we’ve got to give patients the best service possible.

    **Catalyze:** There was so much good stuff in that answer you gave, and I was wondering when CVS, or Walgreens, Walmart or Target were going to come out, but anytime you talk about convenience in healthcare, it’s hard to beat 9,000 locations from a convenience perspective. And you guys don’t sell Snickers bars so that makes it even harder.

    **Mr. Vengco:** Yeah, that’s a problem. I told the CEO that we have to sell Snicker’s and KitKats, you know? Without that, we are dead in the water.

    **Catalyze:** We work with a few telemedicine providers and I even imagine that for specific types of services you might be okay with telemedicine, but with other types of services, you might want the convenience of setting up an appointment online, but you might still want an in-person appointment, like for a pediatric visit, for example. So even within telemedicine, I imagine there are variables in terms of personal preference for what people are actually looking for to engage with.

    **Mr. Vengco:** I totally agree. In fact in the telemedicine realm we are piloting two to three different types of telemedicine scenarios. There's of course the physician-to-physician consults so the patient can stay in their local community hospital and then their physician can consult with somebody in our tertiary facility, with a specialist, for example. And that helps with patient experience. We are starting a pilot with a large kiosk that you can walk into and it almost looks like a port-o-potty, I don’t know why I always think that, but you go in there and have a telemedicine visit with a provider. We can drop those in different places, maybe at the local mall or in the airport or at the university setting. And then there of course is the “go on the portal and use your iPad to connect with a physician” approach.

    **Catalyze:** That’s one of the interesting things to me. There’s been all these different models that have emerged recently, when it comes to telemedicine. I think what drove it initially were things like telestroke, which were kind of mandated, if you didn’t have a stroke specialist. It’s fascinating to me when you have companies that have used the more synchronous video now, but you even have companies like Zipnosis that are doing asynchronous, where you just fill out some documentation and you are able to get some physician response pretty quickly. There’s all these different forms now that telemedicine is taking, which are particularly interesting. And again, you guys seem to be taking an approach of: We’re going to offer the ones that make sense for the breadth of our population. Obviously, these things are clinically effective, but if they are, then these are the things that are going to work for our patients and  we’ll deliver them in as many avenues as we can. I haven’t talked to many systems that say that, so that’s great.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/8g4tyrodqp" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="302"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** You have a company that comes in. I assume not everybody comes in through TechSpring, but other companies that are coming in and potentially doing pilots. They find a clinical champion – pediatrics is sold on this pediatric curbside tool for pediatricians to consult specialty pediatricians. What do you see as the major challenges going from that buying champion, in this case the clinical champion, to actually getting it installed and running and existing as a pilot at Baystate?

    **Mr. Vengco:** That’s a great question, and it’s and important question, too, because finding a champion is certainly a challenge, but that’s A#1 – you’ve got to find a clinical champion, because, operationally, if you want to have something be adopted, or even for small or short term pilot or test to be used, you have to have a clinical champion—and a senior one at that—who is also willing to take time to use it. That’s one challenge.

    The second challenge is of course IT. Owning the IT shop, I know what the challenges are – you need deep interfaces for your pilot and without them you will be out of luck, because everybody is doing things like merging hospitals and doing Meaningful Use and all these things require engineer time, which is very rare. If you’ve got deep integration needs to do the pilot, you’re going to be in deep do-do, right? That’s another thing.

    The third thing is that you’ve got to have project management, a project manager on an innovation project. We don’t call them pilots. If you go through TechSpring, we call them an Innovation Project, but in a sense, it’s a pilot. Having a project manager that knows the timelines, who knows who all the players are, who knows how to move this along is really important, because certainly the technologists won’t push this along, and the clinical champion is just waiting to use it and do something with it. You really need a project manager to push this along. And those are really the three key pieces to doing a successful pilot.

    Oh, and the fourth piece is, you gotta have good success metrics. You gotta be able to show how this really succeed in the short period of time and did it actually achieve the effect and the objectives that this new pilot or new technology was looking to achieve.

    **Catalyze:** Yes, that’s a nice four-point strategy. Most people think you are right – the clinical champion is central, but it really is just the first piece. And then there are a lot of potential speed bumps and road blocks in the way to get a pilot off the ground.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/cawlsnnrit" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="302"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Looking specifically at one of those steps – the technology piece for a company coming in – are there things that you initially look for as to what will work or not from a technology perspective?

    **Mr. Vengco:** One is always what kind of data they are requiring. The integration piece is a big deal, but also to me, it’s the use of the data and the requirements for the data are a good indication of whether their solution is actually going to work.

    I’ll give you an example: An analytics solution. They can come in and show you all these pretty graphs and they often do, and the visualizations get better and better, whether they are 3D or 4D, but at the end of the day when you ask some specific questions about data terminologies or harmonization or any of the things that you need for data liquidity, as I like to call it, many of them don’t have good answers for how you are really going to source those pretty graphs, so that’s one sort of major red flag.

    That doesn’t stop at the analytics firms. We talk to care management firms or care management innovators. They talk about showing a holistic record to a patient, or to a physician. Many out of the gate don’t know how to do that. Or they say, "We are going to deal with it, because your EHR system will have all that data." But that’s not the right answer. People have to understand where the data models lie, where the data sources are, and how to deal with the data, because information is really the key to innovation in the future. That’s the biggest red flag for me is how they deal with the data and how do they deal with this information.

    Number two is security, obviously. Cyber security, information security, network security – even if we are doing a pilot, we want to make sure we know where and how our patient data is being used, accessed and protected. That’s really a big deal for us in IT.

    Then third is just architecture and how does that play with our own architecture, our own environment. Is it a modern architectural code? Is it sustainable? We certainly don’t want to have someone come in with cobalt or any of those older technologies, right? Kind of makes you scratch your head. Those are things that we tend to look at first, and say this looks like it’s going to be a good technology that will progress to the next level.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/e1nirpw0zu" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="302"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** That was incredibly helpful. I think we’ve covered a lot of what we wanted to cover. Is there anything else you want to talk about?

    **Mr. Vengco:** The last thing I would say is that this is such a great time in healthcare, particularly healthcare technology. I’m really excited about the possibilities of working with innovators, thought leaders like yourself, thinking about how we get to the place where we are starting to solve many of these problems, or at least facilitating the solutions for many of these problems through the use of technology.

    In the old days, and that was not that long ago—I’d say that was about five years ago—is that we would build things without really any notion of usability and scalability, and we actually never really had a notion of what will we do with that data after the data gets put in there. Now we have the ability to sort of pick and choose from a variety of different technologies from other industries that have already experienced these types of solutions, so we say, “What if we mashed up all these different technologies and created a solution for some of these problems? What if we invited folks from around the globe and around other industries to come in and try to solve some of our problems?"

    TechSpring was developed specifically to crowd source innovation and to develop something special and unique for many of some of the hardest problems in healthcare today. We just opened the doors of TechSpring back in November and we’ve already seen some really great success stories, and I’m excited to see more success stories come out over the next several years. A lot of our sponsors have been terrific, as well. Some of our big sponsors and big companies that you would know, because obviously they are household names, but they have been fantastic in their belief of TechSpring and their support of TechSpring, and so we are excited about that. There are going to be a lot more press releases coming down the pike from some of the innovations, and also the sponsors and also the partners that we’ve partnered up with at TechSpring, so I hope you look forward to that.

    **Catalyze:** Yeah, we’ll definitely keep up. What you guys are doing is really interesting. It’s the first time I’ve heard of someone really aligning the strategic initiatives of the organization with the innovation group and using those to sort of assess these innovations and projects, so sounds like really exciting stuff, and as you guys progress. And you guys are not even a year old, so I’m sure you’ve learned a lot.

    Well thank you so much for your time Joel.

    **Mr. Vengco:** Thank you again for inviting me on. This was fantastic.
