:body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
  and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
  90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the health
  insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first national
  standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div class=\"callout

  HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n* HIPAA
  holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n* HIPAA
  creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain to handle
  personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use and distribution
  of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare entities and
  organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health information are
  expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of the HIPAA law. When
  completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy, reduce fraudulent
  activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save providers billions of
  dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security risks that could result
  in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus on growing their profits
  instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n## What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div

  [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
  health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of health
  care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual and
  is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or its business
  associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended with the HIPAA
  Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information” is interpreted
  rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record or payment history.
  The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific individual,” which
  is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information) becomes relevant.
  The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal definition, i.e.
  PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual. PHI is a
  subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person — especially
  if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business Service Agreements\n\n<div

  HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
  entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
  are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers,
  and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of
  cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations who
  contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process
  of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process,
  transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI)
  from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required
  to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n## Proving HIPAA

  [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
  can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
  material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
  stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
  feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
  to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
  certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
  healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third party
  vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance, one
  of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
  proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and least
  expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA. Without
  official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough hand-crafted
  documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
  to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
  Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about security
  and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long way to circumventing
  long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly speaking, there are two
  main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be audited against – HIPAA (from
  HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road — Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built
  to create Path 3. There had to be an easier way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice
  modern development practices, comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance
  expert and prove compliance with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more

  experts at Datica."

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

    to how providers market third party services, but here are three need-to-knows
    for the healthcare IT professional. \n"
  :post: |
    ### Business Associates must provide proof of compliance to Covered Entities
    According to the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, covered entities must ensure that their [business associates](/blog/the-importance-of-business-associate-agreements-baas) are instituting proper compliance efforts. This is formerly referred to as “satisfactory assurance” and covered entities must receive this to assure that [protected health information](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi) managed by business associates is meeting the security and privacy protection requirements of the Omnibus Rules, as well as HIPAA and HITECH. So not only must business associates be compliant, but they must provide documentation other sources of information to prove compliance, which has always been the most difficult part of HIPAA.

    ### No penalty caps

    Under the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, certain clarity has been brought to penalties for violations. Although the actual Omnibus Rule seems to be silent on the subject, HITECH seemed to put a cap on the total fines that could be assessed, but the Omnibus Rule does provide new language to revise HITECH’s penalty cap. It is stated in the addendum that there can be civil penalties up to $1.5 million for all identical HIPAA violations in a year. Both covered entities and business associates, can receive further penalties if willful neglect is at play. There can also be additional forfeits if these violations are not identical for up to another $1.5 million per non-identical violation.

    ### Data breaches are assumed with PHI disclosure

    Prior to the HIPAA Omnibus Rules, when covered entities and business associates had sensible supposition that any unseemly disclosed PHI had not been accessed, then that was it, no further investigation or reporting had to be done. Now, under the Omnibus Rule, the disclosure of PHI is automatically assumed to be a [data breach](/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches). “Innocent until proven guilty” no longer applies. The covered entity or business associate will now need to show that there is a very slim chance that the PHI has been undermined. Now organizations must prove their innocence rather than it being assumed. These instances will always be included in proper HIPAA compliance documentation as retaining investigation proof is a mandated process.

  :post: "### So what does a HIPAA Risk Assessment require?\n\nThe Department of Health
    and Human Services has defined nine necessary constituents of a HIPAA risk assessment
    that all healthcare and healthcare-related organizations that store or share ePHI
    must include in their assessment document:\n\n1. Assessment Scope - Inclusive
    of any and all potential risks and susceptibilities to the privacy, procurability,
    and morality of ePHI. Organizations should be inclusive of electronic media that
    is utilized such as portable devices, networks, and desktops. If there are multiple
    sites, it is important to include the network security between them in the scope;
    this includes your hosting terms with third-parties or business associates.\n\n2.
    Data Reserve - Where is the data being stored, collected, conserved or transmitted?
    \n\n3. Specify and Record Latent Risks and Susceptibilities - Predicting future
    HIPAA violations can really help your organization rapidly and effectively find
    a resolution.\n\n4. Evaluate Existing Security Measures - This will include any
    encryption, two-factor authentication, and all other security methods that your
    HIPAA hosting provider has put in effect.\n \n5. Evaluate the Feasibility of a
    Risk Occurring - In association with #3, this will accurately estimate the possibility
    of an ePHI breach.\n\n6. Evaluate the Impact a Risk Occurrence Could Have - Assess
    how many people could be affected and the level of PHI that could be exposed,
    inclusive of health information and billing information. \n\n7. Assess the Level
    of Risk - The Department of Human and Health Services recommends taking #5 and
    #6 to establish the level of risk. When documenting these risk levels, accompany
    with them a list of actions that would be performed in a mitigative response.\n\n8.
    Prepare Documentation - There are no parameters around documentation formatting
    but the assessment must be in writing.\n\n9. Regular Reviews and Updates to HIPAA
    Risk Assessment - It is crucial that the assessment is ever ongoing. It is recommended
    that a new assessment is taken whenever new processes, technologies, or operations
    are introduced into an organization. \n\nCurious how we at Datica do our HIPAA

    we explore what a HIPAA Risk Assessment is and why it is crucial in ensuring the
    safe-handling of [protected health information (PHI)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    with the growing dependency on information technology in the Healthcare Industry
    and the implementation of electronic medical records (EMR).

  :post: "Back in February of 2009 the [HITECH (Health Information Technology for
    Economic and Clinical Health)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/data-security-patient-engagement/)
    Act was passed as an element of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to
    fortify the privacy and safety of PHI by including provisions to the HIPAA Standards.
    Among the stipulations in HITECH was the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    which has requirements organized into three classifications, and within each classification
    are 18 standards and 36 implementation specifications that are categorized as
    “Required” or “Addressable”. The **Required** specifications are crucial and necessities
    to be implemented; whereas, **Addressable** specifications are meant for scalable
    consideration based on individual and entity needs and best practices. \n\n##
    The Three Classifications \n\n## 1. Administrative Safeguards\nThese constitute
    more than half of the HIPAA Security Assessment requirements. As with all three
    standards, compliance will mandate an evaluation of the security controls in place
    already, a precise and in-depth analysis, and a succession of documented solutions
    derived from a multitude of factors unique to each covered body.\n\nThese safeguards
    are broken down as follows:\n\n### Standard: Security Management Process\nThe
    intent is to create the administrative processes and operations that a covered
    body will utilize to enact the security program in its environment.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Risk Analysis (Required)\n2. Risk Management (Required)\n3.
    Sanction Policy (Required)\n4. Information System Activity Review (Required)\n\n###
    Standard: Assigned Security Responsibility\nThe goal is to recognize who will
    hold responsibility for ensuring that the covered body abides by the HIPAA Security
    Rule. There are no implementation standards for this standard.\n\n### Standard:
    Workforce Security\nThe objective is to identify each workforce member that necessitates
    access to ePHI and their need, time of need, and how they are going to control
    access to the information. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Authorization
    and/or Supervision (Addressable)\n2. Workforce Clearance Procedure (Addressable)\n3.
    Termination Procedures (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Information Access Management\nMeant
    to restrict access to solely persons with a need for specified ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Isolating Health Care Clearinghouse Functions (Required)\n2.
    Access Authorization (Addressable)\n3. Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable)\n\n###
    Standard: Security Awareness and Training\nTraining for all new and current members
    of the entity’s staff is mandated by the Security Rule.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Security Reminders (Addressable)\n2. Protection from Malicious
    Software (Addressable)\n3. Log-in Monitoring (Addressable)\n4. Password Monitoring
    (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Security Incident Procedures\nImplemented to call
    attention to security occurrences within the covered body’s environment. \n\n####
    Implementation Specifications\n1. Response and Reporting\n\n### Standard: Contingency
    Plan\nNecessitates to plan and establish strategies for retrieving access to ePHI
    if an entity where to experience a crisis or occurrence that disrupts urgent business
    operations.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Data Backup Plan (Required)\n2.
    Disaster Recovery Plan (Required)\n3. Emergency Mode Operation Plan (Required)\n4.
    Testing and Revision Procedures (Addressable)\n5. Applications and Data Criticality
    Analysis (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Evaluation\nRequires entities to create
    a process to review and maintain standard security measures to comply with The
    Security Rule. There are no implementation specifications for this standard.\n\n###
    Standard: Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements\nStates that covered
    bodies are required to sign a contract or other agreement that meet the definition
    of a “business associate.” This standard has no implementation specifications.\n\n##
    2. Physical Safeguards\nThese safeguards are meant to evaluate and implement all
    physical access to ePHI.\n\nThese are broken down as follows within a HIPAA Security
    Assessment:\n\n### Standard: Facility Access Controls\nEnacted to limit the access
    to the electronic information systems where ePHI is housed.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Contingency Operations (Addressable)\n2. Facility Security
    Plan (Addressable)\n3. Access Control and Validation Procedures (Addressable)\n4.
    Maintenance Records (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Workstation Use\nRequires that
    entities clarify the proper uses to be done by electronic computing devices. There
    are no implementation specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Workstation
    Security\nAddresses the operations and procedures for how workstations should
    be utilized and secured from unauthorized persons. There are no implementation
    specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Device and Media Controls\nThis
    covers the correct handling of electronic media including removal, receipt, backup,
    storage, reuse, disposal, and responsibility. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
    Disposal (Required)\n2. Media Re-Use (Required)\n3. Accountability (Addressable)\n4.
    Data Backup and Storage (Addressable)\n\n## 3. Technical Safeguards\nA covered
    body is mandated to determine the security protocol and specified technologies
    that are appropriate for implementing in its organization while complying with
    these safeguards which are broken down according to the HIPAA Security Assessment
    as follows:\n\n### Standard: Access Control\nRequired to provide/restrict persons
    with the access necessary for the information systems, applications, programs,
    or files associated with ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Unique
    User Identification (Required)\n2. Emergency Access Procedure (Required)\n3. Automatic
    Logoff (Addressable)\n4. Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)\n\n### Standard:
    Audit Controls\nThis standard is meant to be useful for the records and examinations
    of information system activity, particularly in a security violation.This standard
    has no implementation specifications.\n\n### Standard: Integrity\nThis standard
    requires that policies and processes are implemented to protect ePHI from being
    altered or destroyed.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Mechanism to Authenticate
    Electronic Protected Health Information(Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Person or
    Entity Authentication\nThis standard confirms that a person is who they are claiming
    to be before being granted the access to ePHI. This standard has no implementation
    specifications.\n\n### Standard: Transmission Security\nThis standard is utilized
    to guard against those who are not granted permissions to ePHI that is being communicated
    over electronic means.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Integrity Controls
    (Addressable)\n2. Encryption (Addressable)\n\nIn summary, when doing your own
    HIPAA Security Assessment, keep in mind that this applies to all media types including
    oral, paper, and electronic while simultaneously considering integrity, confidentiality,
    and availability. There are many HIPAA Security Assessment tools and services
    that have been released but no one is more highly regarded in this space than
    Datica as a [HIPAA compliance authority](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).

    could save you some big risks and some even bigger costs.

'
  :blog_lead: 'In a world where technology, healthcare, and business are all integrated,
    a thorough understanding of semantics is critical, especially when [PHI (protected
    health information)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    is at risk. No matter what your relationship with HIPAA may be, knowing the difference
    between being HIPAA ready and HIPAA compliant could save you some big risks and
    some even bigger costs.

'
  :post: |
    A general rule of thumb is to be very chary when providers of hosting platforms are claiming to be “HIPAA ready” or “HIPAA certified”; preferably target potential business partners that are “HIPAA audited” or “HIPAA compliant.” Just about any technology can be considered HIPAA ready but what do vendors really mean when they say that? All that being “ready” affirms is that the scope of your audit is extended to include those components. This will require your internal information security team to approve the system architecture in comprehensive detail prior to commencement, which will lengthen or even prevent you from launching your program.

    On the other hand, [Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/), a proven and audited [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) platform, is healthcare’s trusted service in digital health for a reason. Our customers utilize our audit reports, policy page, and HIPAA mappings as the foundation of their compliance programs. With a [HIPAA ready platform service](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), the reliance you can foster in that provider is defunct from the very beginning.

    At Datica, we have taken the burden of compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training, etc.) so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) is even used as evidence to auditors to prove certain qualifications of HIPAA. These benefits of authentic HIPAA compliance are lost when falling into the wordplay trap that these HIPAA ready hosting services and platforms advertise.

    In this day and age, a critical mistake that healthcare organizations make in concerns to HIPAA is assuming  compliance is as simple as implementing security tools to prevent PHI breaches, or implementing assessment procedures that can potentially catch problems before proving to be incidental. Although HIPAA is a regulation that can be complex and difficult to fully grasp, there is one thing that should be commonly understood:

    **Just because you’re _HIPAA Ready_ does not mean that you are ready for HIPAA.**

  :summary: Guess what? HIPAA doesn't say how long you have to keep medical records.
    This is a common misconception of HIPAA data retention policy.
  :blog_lead: 'It may come as a surprise, but you don''t have to retain medical records
    according to [HIPAA rules](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/three-hipaa-omnibus-rule-essentials-for-it-security/).
    This is a very common misconception with HIPAA. Medical records means electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) in this case. HIPAA does not have any rules
    that require covered entities or business associates to retain ePHI. I assume
    this is a common question for HHS as they have it listed in a [HIPAA FAQ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/580/does-hipaa-require-covered-entities-to-keep-medical-records-for-any-period/index.html).

'
  :post: "![Point 6 of HIPAA retention rules](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/646QbbgQqk0oWkeqSuuYMg/d33d3aa0a6d900257741cf80cb628538/blog-main-retention.png)\n\nThe
    confusion likely stems from two things. First, most states have requirements that
    covered entities retain ePHI for a certain period of time, even if the covered
    entity closes its doors; I imagine the most common case of a covered entity closing
    is a physician retiring. As a covered entitiy, the onus is on you to understand
    the requirements in the states that you work in and to comply with them.\n\nThis
    is a case I'm personally exposed to right now as a doc friend is retiring and
    is trying to figure out what to do with his medical records for the next 10 years.
    His records are all paper and he's retiring to avoid having to use an EHR. Yes,
    this does happen and some doctors feel so strongly, in a bad way, about EHRs that
    they are are retiring early to avoid having to change the way they've practiced
    for 30, 40, or even 50 years.\n\nThere are issues that arise when a [business
    associate](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    such as an EHR company, goes out of business and the covered entity needs to get
    the records and find a way to store them. We've seen this experience too, especially
    in the case of smaller, specialty specific EHRs and practice management systems.
    More on this in another post.\n\nThe second reason for the misconception about
    HIPAA and retention of ePHI is that HIPAA does have data retention rules but,
    oddly enough, they don't apply to ePHI. **Section 164.316(b)(1)** of HIPAA require
    orgs:\n\n> (i) Maintain the policies and procedures implemented to comply with
    this subpart in written (which may be electronic) form; and (ii) if an action,
    activity or assessment is required by this subpart to be documented, maintain
    a written (which may be electronic) record of the action, activity, or assessment.”
    \n\n**Section 164.316(b)(2)(i)** goes on to state:\n\n> Retain the documentation
    required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 6 years from the date of its
    creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later.”\n\nThere
    are lots of policy and documentation requirements in HIPAA, and the rules around
    data retention apply to those. You should be maintaining all of your policies
    and documentation that address aspects of HIPAA, and you should plan to retain
    it all for 6 years at a minimum. You should also maintain all risk assessments,
    audits, and other documentation related to your organization.\n\n## Datica policy
    and documentation retention\n\nAt Datica we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for
    version control on our policies, and the current versions are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
    and maintained in a Master branch. [More on why we do this in a separate post](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/our-company-policies-now-available-free-on-github/).\n\nWe
    backup our current policies using Box. For risk assessments, change and configuration
    management, vulnerability scanning, and audits we also use Box as a repository.
    You can see our current policies here - [policy.datica.com](https://policy.datica.com).\n\n"

    to HIPAA compliance must be written and documented, but employees are required
    to be trained on them whilst also having an expounded privacy officer accountable

    not been fully systematized but risk of press coverage and detrimental consumer
    perceptions cannot be overlooked. \n\nThe required HIPAA Compliance Assessment

  :post: "## HIPAA Security is still a problem\n\nOne thing is certain: healthcare
    [still has a security problem](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
    The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT
    incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
    2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg\"
    alt=\"2017 Data Breaches by Type\">\n\nOne of the largest, which occurred at Airway
    Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in
    a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and
    reported the breach to HHS in June. \n\nAccording to [a story about the Airway
    Oxygen breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier)
    in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed
    an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and
    applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed
    monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a
    cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.
    \n\nThe story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all
    of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s
    no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking. \n\n##
    Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers\n\nAnother interesting
    thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities
    reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered
    security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies,
    and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches
    as well. \n\nLate in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, [MongoDB databases
    fell victim to ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html)
    attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due
    to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice)
    that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special
    hacking tool.” \n\nMongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software,
    but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September
    2017, as many as 26,000 [databases were hijacked and held for ransom](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find).
    Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in
    the attacks, along with other entities. \n\n## Lessons from others’ mistakes\n\nOn
    December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st
    Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
    (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI)
    was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals. \n\nThe FBI found that
    the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server.
    As many as 2.2 million people were affected. \n\nThe settlement was for 21CO to
    pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to
    an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein & Lehr LLP,\nthe results
    of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into [what all healthcare
    entities should be doing](https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement):
    \n\n> The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate
    and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI);
    (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and
    vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement
    procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and,
    (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate
    without having written business associate agreement in place.” \n\nThe CAP that
    21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising
    security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements,
    among several other steps. \n\nSaul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr offer advice to other
    business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing, \n\n> As we begin
    2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy,
    Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance
    and make timely adjustments as appropriate.” \n\nAs we move through 2018 and toward
    May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves
    us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not
    only with HIPAA, but also [with GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/). After
    all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that
    amount in GDPR fines.\n\nLet Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for

  :summary: Guess what? HIPAA doesn't say how long you have to keep medical records.
    This is a common misconception of HIPAA data retention policy.
  :blog_lead: 'It may come as a surprise, but you don''t have to retain medical records
    according to [HIPAA rules](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/three-hipaa-omnibus-rule-essentials-for-it-security/).
    This is a very common misconception with HIPAA. Medical records means electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) in this case. HIPAA does not have any rules
    that require covered entities or business associates to retain ePHI. I assume
    this is a common question for HHS as they have it listed in a [HIPAA FAQ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/580/does-hipaa-require-covered-entities-to-keep-medical-records-for-any-period/index.html).

'
  :post: "![Point 6 of HIPAA retention rules](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/646QbbgQqk0oWkeqSuuYMg/d33d3aa0a6d900257741cf80cb628538/blog-main-retention.png)\n\nThe
    confusion likely stems from two things. First, most states have requirements that
    covered entities retain ePHI for a certain period of time, even if the covered
    entity closes its doors; I imagine the most common case of a covered entity closing
    is a physician retiring. As a covered entitiy, the onus is on you to understand
    the requirements in the states that you work in and to comply with them.\n\nThis
    is a case I'm personally exposed to right now as a doc friend is retiring and
    is trying to figure out what to do with his medical records for the next 10 years.
    His records are all paper and he's retiring to avoid having to use an EHR. Yes,
    this does happen and some doctors feel so strongly, in a bad way, about EHRs that
    they are are retiring early to avoid having to change the way they've practiced
    for 30, 40, or even 50 years.\n\nThere are issues that arise when a [business
    associate](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    such as an EHR company, goes out of business and the covered entity needs to get
    the records and find a way to store them. We've seen this experience too, especially
    in the case of smaller, specialty specific EHRs and practice management systems.
    More on this in another post.\n\nThe second reason for the misconception about
    HIPAA and retention of ePHI is that HIPAA does have data retention rules but,
    oddly enough, they don't apply to ePHI. **Section 164.316(b)(1)** of HIPAA require
    orgs:\n\n> (i) Maintain the policies and procedures implemented to comply with
    this subpart in written (which may be electronic) form; and (ii) if an action,
    activity or assessment is required by this subpart to be documented, maintain
    a written (which may be electronic) record of the action, activity, or assessment.”
    \n\n**Section 164.316(b)(2)(i)** goes on to state:\n\n> Retain the documentation
    required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 6 years from the date of its
    creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later.”\n\nThere
    are lots of policy and documentation requirements in HIPAA, and the rules around
    data retention apply to those. You should be maintaining all of your policies
    and documentation that address aspects of HIPAA, and you should plan to retain
    it all for 6 years at a minimum. You should also maintain all risk assessments,
    audits, and other documentation related to your organization.\n\n## Datica policy
    and documentation retention\n\nAt Datica we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for
    version control on our policies, and the current versions are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
    and maintained in a Master branch. [More on why we do this in a separate post](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/our-company-policies-now-available-free-on-github/).\n\nWe
    backup our current policies using Box. For risk assessments, change and configuration
    management, vulnerability scanning, and audits we also use Box as a repository.
    You can see our current policies here - [policy.datica.com](https://policy.datica.com).\n\n"

  :summary: The biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply
    the complexity of understanding everything. This new compliance self-assessment
    worksheet will help.
  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on
    the cloud. Sometimes it''s simple, like how long to retain PHI data for disaster
    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,

  :post: |2

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

  :summary: 'The HIPAA acronym stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act. This HIPAA primer covers HIPAA 101 basics, meaning, entitities, etc. '
  :post: |-
    This article assumes no prior knowledge of HIPAA and is meant to present a very high level snapshot of what HIPAA is and who it impacts.

    HIPAA stands for the **H**ealth **I**nsurance **P**ortability and **A**ccountability **A**ct. If you're not familiar with HIPAA, or you haven't spent a lot of time in the healthcare industry, you may not realize that spelling "HIPAA" wrong is a running joke.

    Most people, especially in IT, will have some story about a consultant or vendor delivering a report or sending emails with HIPAA spelled wrong. I can remember doing my first HIPAA audit at HCA as a consultant, way back before I went to medical school or knew what an EHR was, and having to do a find-and-replace to assure we caught any misspellings of "HIPAA" before submitted the report to HCA. Just remember it's **not** like "hippo", there's only one "P".

    What's interesting about the acronym "HIPAA" is that the "P" in HIPAA does not stand for "privacy" and the "I" does not stand for "information". It's interesting because the general perception of HIPAA, which is accurate, is that it's main purpose to to "protect" health "information". The reason for this perception is that the protection of health information is essential to avoid financial penalties for breaches and non-compliance. While much of HIPAA, especially as it is enforced by compliance officers to avoid financial risk, is about securing data, HIPAA also sets rules around how data is exchanged between systems and how authorizations are done to allow for access to individual medical records.

    The one other essential acronym with HIPAA is "PHI". [PHI stands for **P**rotected **H**ealth **I**nformation](https://catalyze.io/learn/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi). PHI is often referred to as "personal health information", which is a pretty accurate description of PHI. PHI is pretty simple - it's the combination of a personal identifier (name, DOB, SSN, IP address, email, etc) with some health-related data (condition, medication, lab, encounter, health payment, etc). PHI warrants a larger discussion but for now it's important to know the term so we can start using it. See [this blog post](https://catalyze.io/blog/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/) for a deeper insight.

    Getting back to HIPAA - the spirit of HIPAA is pretty simple - 1) to secure and protect personal health information and 2) to enforce standards for electronic transactions in healthcare. Specifically, HIPAA has three main parts, summarized below:

    1. **HIPAA Privacy Rule**. This portion of HIPAA deals with protection, access, and authorization related to PHI. It sets rules for when and how PHI is disclosed. It also gives individuals ownership of their health records, as well as the right to access them and request corrections to them.

    2. **HIPAA Security Rule**. The Security Rule sets standards for the security of technology used to access, store, transmit, or process PHI. It is concerned with electronic PHI, or ePHI. It operationalizes much of the Privacy Rule. It's not always prescriptive in how to secure technology, and some aspects are left to interpretation. This section of HIPAA is the most relevant to app developers from a practical standpoint. One additional thing to know is that certain implementation specifications laid out in the security rule are either required, meaning you have to do them, or addressable. Addressable specifications are ones in which an entity needs to either 1) implement the specific implementation as written, 2) implement an alternative specification, or 3) not implement anything for that specific requirements because it is not reasonable or necessary to do so. As with most things in HIPAA, the important thing is that decisions related to addressable specifications are documented.

    A quick side note on documentation - as we alluded to earlier, HIPAA is not prescriptive. Therefore, the general approach has been one of being able to show that the risk of data leakage / breach has been mitigated to the extent possible and the steps taken to do so documented (and updated when changed). These reams of documentation are in place so that in case of a breach, companies can show the extent to which safeguards were implemented.

    3. **Administrative Simplification**. This area of HIPAA relates to the accepted coding for data exchanged in healthcare. The transactions this applies to are financial related (claims, eligibility, enrollment, etc). As the name implies, the intent is to make it administratively easier to exchange data by not having to keep track of an endless number of code sets. The common code sets range from X12 or NCPDP (pharmacy-related) and include DRG, ICD, CPT, NDC, SNOMED-CT, and LOINC amongst others.

    The other aspects of HIPAA that are relevant as a starting point are the types of entities that HIPAA recognizes. Basically, entities fall into two broad buckets:

    1. **Covered Entities**. Health systems, payers, and clearinghouses (process claims) fall into this category.

    2. **Business Associates**. These, most likely you if you're reading this, are entities that provide services to covered entities and through those services access, transmit, process, or store PHI. Changes to HIPAA that went into effect in the fall of 2013 expanded the definition of business associate to include "subcontractors", or entities that provide services to business associates. A simple use case - a developer that builds a PHR for a hospital is a business associate, and the hosting provider that developer uses (ideally Datica) is a subcontractor. The developer signs a BAA with the hospital and as well as with the hosting provider, again ideally Datica.

    So that's our intro. You now know more about HIPAA that 99.9% of the population. The rest of our articles go into much more depth on these topics but this is a great place to start.

  :summary: The acronym PHI stands for Protected Health Information. An individual's
    PHI is data on health status, provision of health care, or payment for health.
  :post: |-
    **The acronym**: PHI stands for **P**rotected **H**ealth **I**nformation - not personal health information (although that's in essense what it implies), not personally identifiable health information (I've seen it used although that would technically be PIHI) and I'm sure there are variants of this that you've heard as well.


    **The definition**: Here's the wikipedia [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information). Protected health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual. HHS provides an even simpler  of PHI - individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a Covered Entity or its Business Associate; the definition of a "business associate" has been extended with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. This term "information" is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient's medical record or payment history. The key here is this phrase "that can be linked to a specific individual". Which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information) - here's the [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) to the wikipedia article on that - becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal definition - i.e. PII is anything that **could** be used to uniquely identify an individual. PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person - especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.

    ## Protection

    The core of the HIPAA regulations is to ensure that ownership of any and all medical data is retained solely by the individual. The individual can then decide to parcel out access to others - providers, family members, employers if needed or necessary or simply by preference of the record owner. Only an individual has the right to grant access to their medical data. This was mainly done for the following reasons:

    1. **Privacy**: Obviously we would prefer that our neighbor (or in some cases, family members) not know about whatever condition we might be suffering from or medication we are taking.

    2. **Bias and discrimination**: AIDS, mental health and other conditions have some (albeit declining) social stigma associated with it. The HIPAA PHI provisions ensure that employers and others do not have access to one's medical record and use the information contained within to discriminate against the individual based on their health information.

    ## Uniqueness

    Obviously protection and privacy come into play once the individual can / has been uniquely identified. [There are after all 25.8 million Americans have diabetes](http://ndep.nih.gov/diabetes-facts/). Which leads to the question of what data can be used to uniquely identify an individual. The generally accepted set of individually unique data elements include the following:

    |#|Identifier|Description|
    |-|----------|-----------|
    |1|Name|Well, of course i.e. first name, last name, maiden name combinations. One could argue that just any **one** of the above doesn't uniquely identify an individual after all "James" is a pretty common name. But it could be possible to identify an individual using a combination of data i.e. first name, zipcode, street address etc.|
    |2|Geographic locators|Everything (street address, city, precinct, zipcode, lat long coordinates etc.) are considered PII. The first three digits of the zipcode are usually considered ok for use except in the case of certain zipcodes which cover a small population (less than 20,000). There are currently 17 zipcodes that fit that profile - 036, 692, 878, 059, 790, 879, 063, 821, 884, 102, 823, 890, 203, 830, 893, 556, 831. So three digit zipcodes are ok to be used except for the above listed ones.|
    |3|Dates|Pertaining to significant events in an individual's life - birth, death, marriage, admission, discharge etc. Just the year is generally considered fine for use except in the case of the very elderly (>89 years of age; in which case they would be represented by an aggregate category, e.g. <90)|
    |4|Phone numbers|Well, of course.|
    |5|Fax numbers|This is, IMHO, a carryover from the old days. Do you know a lot of people with a personal fax number? But, it does make sense.|
    |6|Electronic mail addresses (email)|Check|
    |7|Social Security numbers|Check|
    |8|Medical record numbers|This is usually a "random" number and could be used if one also knew the institution that assigned it.|
    |9|Health plan beneficiary numbers|This is your insurance card / member ID.|
    |10|Account numbers|Bank numbers etc.|
    |11|Certificate/license numbers|Drivers license, birth certificate number etc.|
    |12|Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers|If it's good enough for the police to track someone down...|
    |13|Device identifiers and serial numbers|Medical devices have unique serial numbers. Your computer's MAC id is unique as well.|
    |14|Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)|This is a bit murky but is in here to cover all possibilities. http://www.facebook.com isn't very unique. But if logged within a specific application, could indeed be very unique to an individual.|
    |15|Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers|Your IP address can be used to easily identify your address. There are several free services that offer this (do a quick google search for [address from ip](https://www.google.com/search?q=address+from+ip&oq=address_) and try this as an [example](http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm)|
    |16|Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints|Don't forget retinal images.|
    |17|Full face photographic images and any comparable images|Check|
    |18|Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code|Re code - note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the system to code the data.|

    These 18 elements are the core set of data elements that individually or in combination can be used to uniquely identify an individual. And, considering the fact that the above list of identifiers has **fax numbers** and not Twitter @usernames, Facebook IDs, or a host of other modern, more common identifiers, it's clear that the PII list is not the most up to date and some more thought should go into recognizing and protecting identifiable information. However, since patient data is valuable in clinical trials, medical case studies etc., the above list is used as a guideline to ensure privacy. Which leads to...

    ## Anonymization & De-identification

    **Anonymization** is a process by which PHI elements are removed or changed with the purpose of minimizing / removing the possibility of going back to the original data set. This involves removing all identifying data to create unlinkable data.

    **De-identification** under HIPAA occurs when data has been stripped of common identifiers by two methods:

    1. Remove the 18 elements listed above;

    2. If another approach is used, ensure a statistically small / negligible risk of re-identification which is validated by a statistics expert (you have to love the interpretability of that rule).

    ## Designing HIPAA compliant solutions

    Given the above constraints, it is essential that any application that you design takes these anonymization and/or de-identification requirements into account before any data is shared with any external entity. PHI data can be "shared" with an external entity provided you have BAA ([business associate agreement](http://healthcare.partners.org/phsirb/hipaaglos.htm#g7)) in place and the individual has signed the appropriate consent documents. How PHI needs to be managed under HIPAA is a whole topic in itself. Look for a blog post from us shortly describing how we enable HIPAA compliance and simplify adherence to the letter and spirit of the law at [Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).

  :summary: 'HIPAA attestation is everywhere but are they really compliant? Companies
    can self-attest to HIPAA compliance because there are no HIPAA certifications. '
  :post: "> I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger
    to my father. He said he wanted more proof. - Rodney Dangerfield\n\nAnybody can,
    and many companies do, put \"HIPAA Compliant\" on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to [selling software](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/whitepapers/making-enterprise-healthcare-sales-easier/)
    that processes, stores, transmits, or somehow touches [ePHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/).
    It's an essential, though non-differentiating, feature of any B2B healthcare technology
    product. The reason companies can self-attest to being HIPAA compliant is that
    there isn't a certifying body, or accompanying certification, for HIPAA. That's
    problematic for both _vendors_ making and selling healthcare software to enterprises
    and _enterprises_ buying software from third party vendors. Let's talk briefly
    about those two camps.\n\n* **Vendors.** Compliance is a challenge because vendors
    constantly answer the same questions over and over again, though often phrased
    differently or in different formats (word docs vs spreadsheets). They often must
    provide different forms of evidence for each of these reviews. Not having evidence,
    or not having validated (externally audited) evidence, can slow the process and
    extend sales and implementation cycles.\n\n* **Enterprises.** Compliance is problematic
    for enterprises because they need to collect and review different forms of evidence
    and responses to questions from vendors. This takes time, does not typically leave
    security and compliance groups with lots of confidence since the evidence is so
    scattered and largely self-attested. Angst is often created between business buyers
    and compliance groups.\n\nThe end result is an inefficient process of security
    and compliance reviews where vendors and enterprises essentially reinvent the
    wheel for every new relationship. It's akin to how EHR integrations work today
    in that every new contract for a vendor or enterprise is like creating a new point-to-point
    relationship. Similarly, it can be a big stumbling block for vendors, especially
    smaller ones that have a hard time absorbing the cost of longer sales cycles.\n\n\n##
    HIPAA vs PCI\n\nThe financial industry, in contrast to healthcare, created a standardized
    certification for processing financial transactions or storing financial data.
    The [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2-0#pci_dss_v2-0)
    is a set of rules and requirements that can be tested, with passing resulting
    in certification to process financial transactions. Financial organizations and
    vendors work with a [qualified security assessor](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/qualified_security_assessors.php)
    in order to be certified. As opposed to HIPAA, organizations cannot self-attest
    to being \"PCI Compliant.\"\n\nThe reason for the differences between the financial
    industry (PCI) and the healthcare industry (HIPAA) is that PCI was created and
    is maintained by the private sector. If you look at who governs PCI, it's almost
    all the [large financial institutions](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/organization_info/executive-committee.php).
    Essentially PCI is self-governing. HIPAA, in contrast, was created and is maintained
    by Health and Human Services (HHS), a government agency responsible for many different
    areas of healthcare. HIPAA is [interpreted and enforced](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/whos-really-interpreting-and-enforcing-hipaa-for-startups/)
    by non-government organizations and not HHS.\n\nChange is coming in healthcare
    that will make HIPAA more like PCI. The changes are represented in the new compliance
    framework and certification called [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).\n\nHITRUST,
    like PCI, is [governed by a board made up of large private sector healthcare organizations](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/)
    like Anthem and United Healthcare. HITRUST maintains the [Common Security Framework
    (CSF)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/), which is
    essentially a PCI DSS for healthcare and HIPAA. Similarly to PCI, HITRUST CSF
    Certifications are granted to organizations that complete the CSF, have the results
    validated by an [approved third party assessor](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/),
    and then are verified by HITRUST itself. The resulting form of evidence is a certification
    and standard report. Datica has been through the HITRUST process and is awaiting
    final verification from HITRUST.\n\n\n## How to Prove HIPAA Compliance\n\nDifferent
    paths can lead to HIPAA compliance. To be clear, we're talking about proving compliance
    with HIPAA as part of an enterprise (payer and provider system) deployment. We've
    outlined a couple of options below. We have personal experience with each path,
    and have Datica customers that fit into each, so we feel confident discussing
    the pros and cons of each.\n\n\n### Path 1 - Self Assessments\n\nThe first option
    does not require third party verification or auditing. Not shockingly, self assessments
    are the easiest and least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show
    compliance with HIPAA.\n\nDownsides proliferate, however. The inspiration that
    led to the formation of Datica was based on our experience trying to sell modern,
    cloud based software as part of a previous venture; it's also important to note
    this was just before the new HIPAA Omnibus Rules went into effect in late 2013.
    We were selling to large healthcare enterprises (mostly academic - UCSF, University
    of Colorado, etc) and trying to prove compliance with HIPAA based on our own assessment.
    We were spending the majority of our time configuring our technology and updating
    our policies and internal procedures in order to deploy our technology and complete
    sales. All that time, effort, and work was going into things that our users would
    never see or appreciate. It's the reason we built Datica and the reason we [open
    sourced our policies and procedures](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).\n\n\n####
    Supporting Documentation\n\nWithout official audit reports you must illustrate
    your compliance story through hand-crafted documentation. You can simply respond
    to compliance questionnaires with specific technical settings, but you may also
    have to provide some form of proof (like screenshots of settings or links to policies).\n\nA
    better approach is to use some type of framework to pre-compile answers to questions
    around HIPAA. The best framework to use is the [Audit Program Protocol](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/audit/protocol.html)
    from OCR (part of HHS). Companies complete this framework to at minimum identify
    existing gaps before talking to compliance officers. Another option is to complete
    the [Common Security Framework (CSF)](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/)
    from HITRUST. This is more involved and takes more time than the OCR framework
    but provides a standardized report (not a spreadsheet you created yourself for
    the OCR framework). Self-assessing with HITRUST also has a cost, whereas the OCR
    framework is free.\n\nBe prepared to answer many questions. You will need both
    technology settings and policies to prove compliance. You need to assure technology
    (things like backup and DR) and internal procedures (things like training) are
    in line.\n\nWe've been through [multiple third party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    at Datica. Based on that experience, we discovered transparency and proactive
    approaches to HIPAA have value for everyone. We decided to publish our [policies](https://policy.datica.com/)
    and our [mappings to HIPAA](https://hipaa.datica.com/). The HIPAA page is very
    close to a web page representation of the OCR audit framework linked above. If
    you're interested in leveraging our design for these pages, please [let us know](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to provide you with the code to host it yourself. Also, both
    our policy page and HIPAA page are dynamically generated by Github repos, which
    serve as the master source and provide a great form of version control (good for
    an audit). Our policies are written in Markdown for simplicity.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Less upfront time and effort\n* Lower cost\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* Can derail (or drastically
    slow) sales process\n* A lot more effort during the sales process (it will require
    a lot more time learning about HIPAA to respond to questions)\n\n\n### Path 2
    - Full third party audits\n\nAudits are not fun. Audits are not cheap. \n\nIn
    a previous life, Datica's CEO, [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/),
    conducted technology assessments for HIPAA audits in addition to Datica completing
    three external audits. We feel we have a good understanding of the process and
    value. Despite the effort and cost, audits are the single best way to streamline
    the security and compliance portion of the sales process.\n\nWe fully realize
    audits aren't an option for many smaller organizations. We are often asked \"when
    should I do an audit?\" and \"do I have to do an audit to close a deal?\" The
    answer to the latter question is an emphatic _No_, you don't have to do an audit
    to close a deal with a healthcare enterprise. The answer to the former is harder
    to answer. Of current non-enterprise Datica customers, less than 5% have done
    external audits (we think this is fantastic, actually).\n\nVendors typically do
    audits once they have about 4-5 enterprises customers. At this point companies
    shift to scaling sales based on lessons learned from early reference customers.
    It may have taken 12-24 months to acquire the initial 4-5 customers; acquiring
    the next 8-10 customers must be faster. Scaling sales means adding more sales
    agents, many of which won't have the same experience selling and answering questions
    about security and compliance; in this context, audit reports are empowering to
    sales people. Also, organizations with 4-5 customers typically have more resources.
    All those factors seem to push vendors over the tipping point of doing an external
    audit. The audit is a tool to help vendors accelerate and scale sales efforts.
    Maybe the best way to answer the question around when to do an audit is to say
    that doing an audit makes sense when security and compliance is the main bottleneck
    for sales.\n\n\n#### Supporting Documentation\n\nWhile you may still have to answer
    questions from each customer about security and compliance, providing your audit
    reports will go a long way to circumventing long, drawn out security and compliance
    reviews. On many occasions, you may only get asked about gaps that exist in your
    audit reports. Oftentimes those gaps will have associated remediation plans and
    you may get asked if gaps have been remediated. In essence, you've proven compliance
    to third party auditors so there's a lower burden of proof for your customers.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n*
    Speeds up sales process\n* Puts less of a burden on internal resources (sales
    and tech) to be well versed in HIPAA\n\n*Cons:*\n\n* It's expensive and time consuming\n*
    They do become out of date so need to assure you revisit, likely annually\n\n\n####
    Types of audits\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance
    frameworks that you can be audited against:\n\n1. HIPAA (from HHS)\n2. HITRUST\n\nWe've
    done both at Datica. We started with HIPAA, as our auditors recommended, and then
    moved on to HITRUST. We began with a HIPAA gap assessment, which most auditing
    firms will recommend if it's your first audit. Basically a gap assessment is lighter
    weight in terms of verifying things and is meant to, as the name implies, identify
    gaps in your compliance and security programs when mapping those programs to HIPAA
    rules. Once you know the gaps you can address them, or mitigate them if they can't
    be addressed for some reason. From there, a full HIPAA audit is a lot easier and
    holds a much higher chance of success.\n\nOnce we'd completed our gap assessment,
    addressed our gaps, and then completed our HIPAA audit, we did our HITRUST audit.
    The official term for that a Validated HITRUST Assessment. We opted to complete
    the HITRUST assessment because:\n\n1. More enterprises were asking about it\n2.
    A strong security and compliance program and culture at Datica is important\n3.
    It is a valuable tool for our customers in their sales process\n\nAs opposed to
    HIPAA audits, which are somewhat customized by each auditing firm, HITRUST has
    created one framework (the CSF linked above) that all entities are assessed against.
    It doesn't matter if you're small or large, the framework is the same. Some variability
    exists around the scope of a HITRUST audit as there are certain aspects of security
    and compliance that apply to some organizations and not others. HITRUST also has
    the concept of risk levels which determine the extent of questions organizations
    need to answer and prove. The bank of questions and resulting report are standardized.
    It is a true certification, as opposed to HIPAA.\n\nFor us, the HITRUST assessment
    involved two site visits and completing 278 different question areas. Each question
    area required attestation of 5 different maturity levels and each maturity level
    required some form of justification and/or proof. Also, many questions required
    additional comments to add context and specificity for how the question area fit
    with Datica. Taking out the comments and back and forth as HITRUST and our auditors
    reviewed our responses, that's just under 7,000 responses. Completing the 7,000
    HITRUST entries was made more painful by the incredibly slow (think spinning pinwheel)
    response times in the CSF web app.\n\nOther certification-type frameworks exist,
    like the [DIRECT certification](http://www.directtrust.org/becoming-accredited/)
    and Meaningful Use. These can be used as a proxy for an audit, as they do assess
    certain aspects of security and compliance programs, but these don't hold as much
    weight as HIPAA or HITRUST audits.\n\n#### Cost of an audit\n\nCost is a common
    question. This is too broad a topic to completely cover here because the [real
    cost of audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) involves more than the
    direct cost. For example, try to estimate the cost of completing 7,000 entries
    in a slow web app for a sense of the indirect costs.\n\nMost want to know the
    direct costs, which is easier to compute. From our experience, and those of customers
    and contacts at other modern tech vendors, the average cost of audits is about
    $20,000 for a HIPAA gap assessment, $20,000-$25,000 for a full HIPAA audit, and
    $30,000-$35,000 for a Validated HITRUST Assessment (includes both auditor's fees
    the the licensing fee to HITRUST). Variability exists from audit firm to audit
    firm but these prices are consistently what we hear.\n\n\n### Path 3 - Middle
    Road: Inheriting Proof\n\nIf you've gotten this far, chances are neither Path
    1 or 2 above appeal to you. Path 1 is easy but can kill sales. Path 2 is expensive,
    extremely time consuming, and you might run out of money before you start selling.
    We've been in your shoes. When we sat down as a team and decided to build Datica,
    pivoting out of our previous venture, neither Path 1 or 2 seemed terribly appealing
    to us.\n\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier way to
    build modern healthcare technology, practice modern development practices, comply
    with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert, and to prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nAs technology has evolved and computing
    has become distributed, driven largely by easy-to-use cloud platforms and APIs,
    different requirements of HIPAA are getting distributed across partner organizations.
    It's why HHS expanded who is covered under HIPAA to include [subcontractors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-subcontractors-and-baas/).
    Covered entities work with business associates who in turn work with one to many
    subcontractors. In this brave new world, certain requirements under HIPAA are
    inherited by business associates from their subcontractors.\n\nThe industry has
    proven our early assumptions. Many customers utilize our audit reports, policy
    page, and HIPAA mappings as the cornerstone of their compliance programs. These
    resources, collectively what we refer to as a **HIPAA Sales Package**, are a core
    part of the value that we provide to our customers. We've spent 1,000s of hours
    on security and compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training,
    etc) and $10,000s on audits so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our
    customers inherit our work and our expertise, making compliance and trust a core
    part of their products. In fact, several of our customers have told us they've
    delayed audits because they leverage Datica.\n\nWhen our customers do decide to
    go down the path of doing a full audit, we help them in the process and make it
    less time consuming for them. Since we've been through multiple HIPAA and HITRUST
    audits, our customers give their auditors our documentation and audit reports
    to show evidence of certain aspects of HIPAA. \n\nHow is Path 3 different from
    Path 1 and other compliant cloud options? If you've built and configured your
    own technology on a traditional hosting vendor like AWS, you're going to have
    to prove every aspect of HIPAA compliance. You can point to the hosting vendors
    SOC2 (other audit reports) and BAA, but those only a address a small subset of
    the HIPAA rules like physical security. All other aspects of HIPAA, from a technical
    perspective, is yours to prove. The same goes for the admin side of HIPAA, though
    this is typically less important to security and compliance groups that the technical
    rules. With Path 3, we offer a fully audited platform and address more of HIPAA
    than any other option.\n\n\n## Choices, choices, choices\n\nIn the end, the path
    you choose to prove HIPAA is up to you and will be driven by your available resources,
    both financial and human. We've focused here more on the technical requirements
    of HIPAA, but the administrative side is also relevant. Completely addressing
    both the technical and administrative side of is necessary to proving compliance
    with HIPAA.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how we can help with
    the technical aspects of HIPAA, don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com).
    If you have specific questions about any of this, please let us know and we'd
    be happy to respond."

  :summary: With ePHI access, business associates are required to sign a HIPAA business
    associate agreement (BAA). Learn more about business associate agreements here.
  :post: |-
    The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of cloud computing companies.

    Business associates are people or organizations who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required to sign what's called a business associate agreement (BAA). Below is the actual language from HIPAA 164.308.

    * (b)(1) Business associate contracts and other arrangements. A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity's behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

    * (2) A business associate may permit a business associate that is a **subcontractor** to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on its behalf only if the business associate obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the subcontractor will appropriately safeguard the information.

    Business associate agreements are basically legal contracts that outline the ways in which business associates follow HIPAA, as well as the responsibilities and risks that the business associate takes on. They typically defines the type of services that the business associate is providing, the type of data that they are interacting with, states that they will follow HIPAA and not disclose PHI without authorization. They also should address areas around breach notifications and penalties. Traditionally, pre-cloud and prior to the HIPAA Omnibus changes of 2013, BAAs were boiler plate. Here's the [template BAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/contractprov.html) from HHS.

    Business associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon that definition of business associate to include something called subcontractors. Subcontractors are typically service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for the covered entities. With subcontractors and APIs and SaaS, there is now a chain of entities touching ePHI in some way, and each of them need to have BAAs in place that are consistent and not contradictory to one another. As an example, a business associate selling to hospital A can't have a breach notification policy of less than 24 hours if the hosting provider they use has a physical breach notification policy of 2 months.

    As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos, more and more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, considered subcontractors. These subcontractors have to sign business associate agreements with business associates, who in turn have to sign a business associate agreement with covered entities. That's actually a very common use case for us at Datica, where most of our early customers are business associates, and their customers are covered entities.

    We spent a lot of time and a lot of money with our attorneys on our BAAs because this is a new area, an area we don't think is well defined yet; we don't think the existing BAA templates are adequate or even make sense for most hosted vendors. In this new paradigm of health technology there are interesting definitions around which entities are responsible, both technically and financially in the case of a breach, for different aspects of the HIPAA rules. We tell our prospective customers to read their current business associated agreements that they have with their hosting providers or other services companies to get a sense of what the legal responsibility is for the business associate and the aspects to which the subcontractor is ultimately. Regardless of who is issuing the BAA, you should read through it in detail because at some point a compliance or security officer likely will read it and you want to be as proactive about compliance issues as you can.

    If you boil it down, business associate agreements are just contracts that outline the ways in which different organizations are going to handle electronic protected health information (ePHI), the types of responsibilities that those organizations take on, some of the very specific rules around their obligations with regards to HIPAA. This last one, the obligations of subcontractors, is an area in which you want to pay close attention. Specifically read what the subcontractors obligations are in terms of timeliness of breach notification, because that was a part of the changes in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule that just went into effect. We have had several early customers come to us because the time period for breach notifications with their existing hosting provider is not acceptable for covered entities they are selling into. We've talked to several companies that have run into roadblocks with enterprises because their business associate agreements with their hosting providers had been out of line, and especially relating to breach notification. Our policy at Datica is breach notification within 4 hours, along with some very detailed [plans](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#notification-in-the-case-of-breach---13402(a)-and-13402(b)) to help you mitigate the risk of a breach.

    At a high level, that's what business associate agreements are and you are expected to have those for all of the various technology and services companies that you work with that might in some way interact, process, store, or have access to ePHI. If you're a business associate or you're a covered entity, we happily sign BAAs. And if you're interested in seeing one of our BAAs, [email us](mailto:legal@datica.com) and we'll walk you through ours and answer any questions you might have about it.

  :summary: The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules
    changed in late 2013 with the new HIPAA Omnibus that adds subcontractors entities.
  :post: |-
    Our mission is to help developers build health apps and technology. Specifically we want to offer tools and services to deal with the security and data challenges in healthcare. The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules changed in late 2013 in ways that we've been planning for at Datica. The new HIPAA Omnibus ("omnibus" means something with several volumes or chapters, I didn't know that so I looked it up and thought I'd share) rules that went into effect on 9/23, amongst other changes, created a category of entities called subcontractors.

    Previously HIPAA rules only defined two categories of entities - covered entities and business associates. Covered entities are basically providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Business associates are basically entities that work with covered entities to perform a service or services to store, transmit, and/or process PHI. The new HIPAA rules expanded the number of categories of entities by 50% with the addition of subcontractors; for those of us in health tech, we think this is a pretty big deal.

    Subcontractors are entities that business associates use to process, create, or store PHI. Subcontractors don't have business associate agreements, or really any direct relationships, with covered entities; but, starting 9/23/2013, theses subcontractors need to have business associate agreements (BAAs) with business associates. It's all very obvious and confusing at the same time. Essentially you can think of subcontractors as a business associate of a business associate.

    The best examples of subcontractors we can think of are hosted services providers like Amazon Web Services, Datica, and Rackspace. Datica is a subcontractor for some of our customers and, as such, we do sign BAAs. We also act as a business associate directly for covered entities like enterprises, and sign BAAs in this capacity as well. We offer the same API-based services for developers in both circumstances, but the relationship is slightly different in the eyes of HIPAA.

    At Datica we know that subcontractors, as defined by HIPAA, have existed for a long time. As more health apps and services have shifted to hosted, or cloud based, and more infrastructure tools (app dev, logging, analytics, data collections, etc) have become mainstream, covered entities and business associates have begun to rely on "subcontractors". The new HIPAA rules now mean those subcontractors need to work with business associates to assure all parties are covered in terms of liability.

    This is a very exciting and major shift for health tech. HIPAA has finally acknowledged subcontractors and the role they play in creating, processing, and transmitting PHI. That's important for health tech to build smart, scalable, and interoperable tools. As a developer in healthcare, if you're considering acting as a business associate, or selling services to a covered entity, you need to understand if you fit into a certain entity category as defined by HIPAA.

    We encourage you to read the rest of the new [rules](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/01/20130117b.html), or at least one of the commentaries that covers them in more detail, to see about the other changes that are a part of the Omnibus rule. If you have any questions related to the new rules, where you potentially fit, and how we can help you mitigate your risk, shoot us an [email](mailto:hello@datica.io).

  :summary: 'HIPAA encryption strategy is another factor of HIPAA compliance, whether
    HIPAA SSL, data at rest, Filevault2, firewall encryption, or more.   '
  :post: |
    Encryption is one of the standards that exist within the HIPAA Security Rule (164.312(a)(2)(iv)). Specifically, encryption is used as a means of access control. HIPAA defines encryption as "the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key". HIPAA goes to say “Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information."

    When we talk about encryption in HIPAA, it means both encryption in transit, or data moving from point A (app) to point B (server/DB), and as encryption at rest, or on the hard drive. Encryption is straightforward. It's become industry practice not just in healthcare, but generally - with web services and even increasingly websites - to use SSL and encryption during transmission. With HIPAA, it's important that you do end-to-end encryption - from app to firewall to app server to database server, or logging server even. That means every step along the way from origination to delivery.

    The level of encryption that you use in transit is something that should be industry best practice. We use 256-bit SSL encryption in transit. We have talked to some large corporate entities that have systems that store massive amounts of ePHI behind firewalls in secure networks and the encryption that they're using is just 56-bit on some of these systems. If you talk to them, they feel that the risk is mitigated because of the environment and the access controls that are round those systems and networks.

    The other aspect of encryption is encryption at rest. If you store data in some type of database, encrypting that hard disk is important. When we started out with Datica, we encrypted all of our hard drives. What we discovered was that we took a pretty big hit on I/O performance doing that with standard drives. We swapped out all of our drives for high performing SSD drives and that improved our performance considerably. Today, we encrypt all of our database drives using AES 256-bit encryption, and the SSD drives make the performance comparable to unencrypted volumes.

    There are other encryption tools you can use to improve performance in an encrypted environment. The newer Intel i5 and i7 chips can do AES-NI, which speeds up encryption considerably. AES-NI is what the makes the performance in FileVault2 encryption on new Macs so much better than the performance in previous versions. As part of our HIPAA workstation security policy, we require FileVault encryption on all company laptops. We also encrypt internal company passwords, SSH keys, and secure notes using Lastpass and 256-bit encryption. Decrypting Lastpass requires two-factor authentication through Duo Security.

    Encryption strategy is something you need to think about. This means more than just encrypting, it means how you are going to securely manage keys and maintain performance of your technology. We're happy to talk to you more about how we take care of all aspects of encryption, from in-transit and at-rest to key management and performance, for our customers.

  :summary: If you're going through a HIPAA security audit by a hospital or payer
    compliance office, auditing and logging will show that your application is secure.
  :post: |
    Auditing and logging are an important part of the HIPAA Security Rule, but there not prescriptive controls defined. According to HIPAA Security Rule - 164.312(b):

    > Implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

    HIPAA goes on to say, in slightly more specific terms, that covered entities and business associates implement:

    > Procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies.

    Put simply, what HIPAA boils down to is that all access, both success and failures, to electronic protected health information (ePHI) should be monitored and logged and be accessible in the case of a breach. You should be able to go back to your HIPAA log and investigate what data was accessed, conduct forensics to try to figure out how that data was accessed in an unauthorized way and who may have been the person or entity that accessed it, and determine if/how data was altered. It's the who, what, when, and how of access that needs to be audited and logged.

    Auditing is so important because the integrity and availability of data is crucial in healthcare and in HIPAA. When ePHI data changes, is deleted, or is accessed in some unauthorized way, that represents a breach to HIPAA and is something that needs to be tracked both proactivel – using alerting and monitoring – as well as reactively, or retroactively, to investigate when an unauthorized breach might have taken place.

    The types of logs should include system and network logs. This is basically what goes into syslog on a *nix box and, ideally, the server has detailed logging turned on. Next, any application access and database access should be logged. The metadata (when, what, where, etc) associated with log data is extremely valuable.

    If you log enough data, you can proactively identify when a breach may have occurred with intelligent alerting. Once logging is properly configured, alerts are relatively easy to add. You can go back and investigate and dive deeper into what that the breach might be and ideally not just say "we store 100,000 patient records and our database was breached, so 100,000 patient records were disclosed improperly." With good logging, you should be able to point to the one, individual record that was breached and additionally maybe even the one specific piece of the record was breached (and how it might have or might not have been altered). That's some of the power of good logging.

    The approach that we take at Datica is to log every interaction with our systems - all API traffic - application logs, database logs, and system logs. For companies that use us as Datica Compliant Cloud, we give them one endpoint so that whatever application logs they are generating, we can store those for them; we'll also help them determine what data they should be capturing in application logs. We store the application logs, along with system logs that we generate, in an encrypted, dedicated store for each customer, and we provide customers with views and API access into that data.

    It's a very powerful unified logging service, one that's HIPAA grade and meant for ePHI. The service sits within our environment right next to your application and we combine your log data that we're already collecting on the servers and network traffic. We pull all that in into one place and give you a managed console for logging. Soon we'll be enabling customers to set alerts as well. If you're going through a HIPAA audit or assessment by a compliance office at a hospital or payer, this is a very powerful tool to assure them of the security and integrity of your application.

  :post: |2+

    As we continue to grow our customer base, we get asked about Datica being a multi-tenant solution and the supposed security challenges that could perhaps arise because of that. We felt that it made sense for us to write up this "position paper" on multi-tenancy and security. Our hope is that this post will clarify our security posture and provide others with a few pointers on better security practices.

    ## The cloud by definition is multi-tenant

    One of the first things to note is that in the modern cloud computing world, **everything** is multi-tenant. All the IaaS providers you use such as Google, MSFT, AWS and Rackspace are multi-tenant. All the SaaS companies that you know and use, such as Salesforce, Intuit and Stripe are multi-tenant. But before we discuss how multi-tenancy and security are not orthogonal, it would be worthwhile to explain tenancy in the cloud context so that we are all on the same page.

    In cloud computing, tenancy generally refers to how the platform (PaaS or Platform as a Service) and underlying infrastructure (IaaS) are shared among different customers. Before we explore this further, let's setup an analogy. Let's setup an apartment building with multiple rental units (tenants). The building itself can be compared to an IaaS (bricks, mortar etc.). The building comes with property management i.e. shared water pump, utilities management (electricity, sewage, garbage collection and so on) and maintenance. Property management can be considered equivalent to a Platform as a Service (Datica Compliant Cloud) i.e. a service that takes care of the details so that the renter (tenant) doesn't have to. Given that analogy, let's dig a bit deeper.

    ### A multi-tenant cloud is where all customers share the same cloud infrastructure. This does not mean that customers can see each other’s data.

    Going back to the analogy, it is the property management organization's responsibility to ensure that Jane Appleseed's key for apartment 101 does not allow her access to apartment 102. She only has access to her occupancy. But she only has one garage door opener with a code specific to her but managed centrally. Similarly, it is the Platform's (Datica Compliant Cloud's) role to ensure that a tenant only has access to their environment (apartment) and associated services (rooms and garage).


    ### Shared infrastructure automatically places a greater emphasis on security. Access to the multi-tenant environment is strictly controlled and customers get a view of **only** their data.

    In the analogy, this requirement forces the property management group (PaaS provider) to plan for separate mailbox keys, tracking users of those keys, correlating keys with the occupants of the apartment, having a doorman to prevent the random pizza guy from entering the building and so on. Living in a building with a doorman is much more secure than an automated buzz-someone-in system. This is what Datica Compliant Cloud manages and maintains on an ongoing basis. We also hire external penetration testers on an annual basis, scan our networks weekly, perform penetration tests internally on a quarterly basis and track possible security breaches as part of our service.

    ### The benefit of a multi-tenant model is that the provider can **maintain** a shared infrastructure for all customers.

    Customers benefit from always being on the latest version of all underlying software - the OS (operating system), the databases, webservers, etc. In the unlikely event that one of our customers learns about a problem before we do, we can immediately take action and ensure that the appropriate fixes get put into place quickly for all our customers. When it’s time to upgrade Datica Compliant Cloud, all of our customers are upgraded at the same time and share the same experience. In the analogy, if property management decides to replace the aging solar panels with more performant ones, all of your tenants get the benefits at the same time. Maintenance is a significant cost not only to the service provider but also to the customer so the easier and cheaper it is, the better off all parties will be. Or in other words...

    > The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases. — Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy

    For example, Salesforce.com, at the relatively high end of the multi-tenancy spectrum, has 72,500 customers who are supported by 8 to 12 multi-tenant instances (meaning IaaS/PaaS instances) in a 1:5000 ratio. Said differently, each multi-tenant instance supports 5,000 tenants who share the same database schema. Intacct, a financial systems SaaS provider in the middle of the spectrum, has more than 2,500 customers who share 10 instances in a 1:250 ratio. [Source](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2517005/data-center/multi-tenancy-in-the-cloud--why-it-matters.html)

    At Datica, we go several steps more to ensure our customers security and isolation.

    - AppArmor profiles: ensure that containers are isolated as much as the underlying operating system allows.
    - Encryption in-transit: ensures that even **within** your environment, all network traffic is encrypted with customer specific keys
    - Encryption at-rest: enforces all volumes are encrypted
    - Customer specific app, database (and cache): are specific to each customer and never shared.
    - Dedicated logging  and monitoring for each customer: to reduce your costs while ensuring your environment remains compliant.
    - Dedicated networking: to assure isolation of all traffic on a per customer basis.

    This is essentially no different from you managing your own set of containers on a IaaS provider. At Datica, our goal is to simplify infrastructure and compliance so that you can focus on your application features and your customers.

  :guide_text: "There’s much to know about both compliance and cloud management and
    that knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education, personnel,
    and money. This guide will help makers of digital health products make informed
    decisions about whether to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in
    the form of the Datica Compliant Kubernetes Service.\n\nThis TCO guide explains
    the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and offers
    a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates for each
    of those considerations. These estimates are based on our extensive experience
    working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers
    (like AWS and Azure).\n\nWhat's inside:\n\n- Understanding compliance in the cloud
    \n- Flying solo on AWS or Azure is primitive\n- The importance of proving compliance
    with HITRUST \n- The total cost of ownership framework and estimates\n- TCO summary"
