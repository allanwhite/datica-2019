:body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
  width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
  Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
  infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public Cloud,
  the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made available
  through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
  developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
  provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can be
  achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work with
  AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is a Platform
  as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner of Amazon AWS.
  Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/).
  At the enterprise-level, the Datica Platform is also available on multiple clouds
  including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it,
  we basically make AWS easier to use for the healthcare developer market. It’s less
  expensive, less time-intensive, less risky, and a better experience to use Datica
  to reap the benefits of AWS than for makers of digital health applications to deploy
  on AWS directly.\n\n<script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/djywh7kkgd.jsonp\"

  Those who just want to use a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica
  customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources
  like VMs. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3.
  Those who already have their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s
  technology on it, which we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have
  both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n## Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with
  the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily
  defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant? Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is
  HIPAA compliant and your application runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA
  compliant too. Here’s where it gets complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly
  to the extent they are required to be at the infrastructure level and as spelled
  out in their [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
  \n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###
  HIPAA Resources\n\n* [Understanding Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/)\n*
  [Datica HIPAA Mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)\n* [Learn the basics of HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/)\n*
  [Whis is HIPAA Important?](http://content.datica.com/why-is-hipaa-important )\n*
  [Is HIPAA Federal or State?](http://content.datica.com/is-hipaa-federal-or-state)\n*
  [When did HIPAA go into effect?](http://content.datica.com/when-did-hipaa-go-into-effect)\n*
  [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
  not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
  greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
  subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
  is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
  and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the subset
  of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary depending
  on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level controls,
  application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has what they
  call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application directly
  on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA compliance.
  \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way down the path
  toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further down the path
  toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can focus on the
  functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica, you get a
  compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications in
  the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital health
  product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
  categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
  someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
  processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a multitude
  of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA terms,
  there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica manages
  the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level, leaving
  you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom to your
  organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
  code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
  provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
  that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how it
  can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers about
  53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of flexibility
  in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle what they
  need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples of these services
  are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset of those 53 primitives
  (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
  like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
  Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
  a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits
  PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica Platform\n\n![How
  the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
  What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
  AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF the
  cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud. That
  means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the Datica
  Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything beyond
  the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and expense
  to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe cloud infrastructure
  that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software, networking, and facilities
  that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities)
  is dependent on the exact application being developed and which cloud services are
  being used by the customer. In general, AWS customers are responsible for security,
  including HIPAA compliance, on all of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption
  & Data Integrity Authentication\n- Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n-
  Network traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System,
  network, and firewall configuration\n- Platform, applications, identity, and access
  management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers of Datica benefit from the fact that our
  BAA extends the security coverage of AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility
  where AWS leaves off. Another way to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure
  about 10% of the way toward HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform,
  Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com) take you much further toward
  100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate the need for the labor, expense,
  or time of all of the above, but you also pass the risk of security onto Datica
  for everything our much more extensive BAA covers. \n\n### Datica’s version of the
  AWS Shared Responsibility Agreement\n\n<script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ie7r75wzct.jsonp\"

  class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_ie7r75wzct seo=false videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\">&nbsp;</div></div></div>\n\n##
  Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision on
  whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
  vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
  major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible, and
  setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring compliance
  while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing and compliant
  basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does that for you.\n*
  It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility model grants
  excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible
  for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform means Datica picks up that
  responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves off.\n* Making each cloud
  primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward but not if you plan to
  employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization and orchestration
  via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development and maintenance
  that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n### Typical
  Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica

  you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
  BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
  [BAA from Datica](https://policy.datica.com/#23.-datica-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-(\"baa\")).
  \n\nAligning Business Associate Agreements amongst all technology partners is a
  full-time job. You sign one BAA with Datica to cover the entirety of compliance
  in the cloud, including AWS HIPAA compliance."

  :blog_lead: |-
    Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

    <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">

    </a>

    We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
  :post: |+
    ## Shift to IaaS

    For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

    Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

    The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

    * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
    * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

    That's a remarkable jump.

    ## Data Data Everywhere

    The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

    Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

    Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

    ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

    What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

    The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

    The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

    ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

    |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
    |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
    |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
    |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
    |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
    |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

    ## What this means to healthcare

    We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

    We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.

  :summary: Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away
    but it's happening now as healthcare embraces SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :blog_lead: Something interesting has been happening in healthcare over the last
    several years. While we’ve been focused on meaningful use, EHRs, and Obamacare,
    healthcare has quietly started to [embrace the cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/).
    Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away. But
    it hasn’t been. In many ways, it’s happened the same way it happened in other
    industries — through data connections between on-premise legacy systems and new
    cloud-based solutions. Just like many enterprises embraced the cloud over the
    last 15 years with Salesforce, so too are healthcare enterprises embracing new
    SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :post: " \n## Data is in the Driver’s Seat\n \n**Healthcare’s onramp to the cloud
    is about data**, not about [lifting and shifting](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/feature/When-to-adopt-the-lift-and-shift-cloud-migration-model)
    legacy systems out of hospital data centers and into the cloud. And, the nature
    of the cloud enables a paradigm shift in the types of solutions that are succeeding.
    Digital health technologies, the major drivers of the future of health IT, are
    being selected *based on the best* of breed model, not *one size fits all* model
    of the [monolithic EHRs](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    that have proliferated and dominated health IT resources for the last fifteen
    years. This swing back to best of breed is important because it opens the door
    for new, highly-targeted and highly-valuable solutions to flourish. Healthcare
    is letting a thousand digital health flowers bloom. On the flip side, this new
    model also creates a ton of noise in the industry that champions and decision
    makers at healthcare enterprises have to wade through.\n \nDon’t get me wrong,
    there are still bottlenecks to the onramp, most notably data integration and,
    most frequently, a non-technical problem; but, even integration is becoming a
    solved problem (FHIR, new APIs, new knowledge transfer, and open source tools
    to educate and jumpstart integrations, etc). [EHR integration](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    is certainly easier to solve than setting up and managing a host of digital health
    applications on premise.\n \n## Beware of the Data Security Risks\n \nBut, this
    type of onramp to the cloud does create a new set of risks for healthcare organizations.
    **The data onramp, in many ways, is more risky than lift and shift.** The data
    being shipped to the cloud is health data and the stewards of that health data
    are [covered entities](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (mostly health systems and insurance companies). This data isn’t contact information
    for sales prospects going into Salesforce. Privacy and security are always important
    but, in healthcare, there is a significant financial risk if you get them wrong.\n
    \nThe risk is compounded as healthcare organizations work with more and more cloud-based
    digital health solutions, as is now happening in the best of breed model that
    has emerged. The challenge in healthcare is that HIPAA is loosely defined at best,
    and loosely audited at worst. So a healthcare organization may work with ten different
    digital health solutions and all ten of those solutions may be on the same cloud
    provider, say AWS for this example, but every one of those digital health solutions
    addresses [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and
    data security in different ways. This makes it nearly impossible for healthcare
    organizations to maintain a consistent data governance posture and, maybe more
    importantly, to understand the their current risk of breach or security incident.\n
    \n## Cloud Cybersecurity Depends on Consistency\n \nSomething we often hear from
    healthcare organizations is that they have a mix of cloud-based solutions that
    are connected to their EHRs. These solutions can include applications built in
    house, applications built by development groups contracted by the organization,
    and SaaS applications developed and supported from 3rd party vendors. Chances
    are every one of those instances is secured and managed differently. At Datica,
    we run a fleet of 500+ cloud hosts across multiple data centers, running many
    different applications and technology stacks. All of those hosts and networks
    are audited and assessed on an ongoing basis. Trust us when we say that **doing
    cybersecurity in the cloud, consistently and continually, is non-trivial.** And
    it’s our [core expertise](https://datica.com/compliance/)!\n \nThese data risks
    are mitigated to some extent in the lift and shift model as the cloud is managed
    and configured in a standard way for technologies [migrating to the cloud](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).
    But, that’s not the model we have in healthcare for the foreseeable future; lift
    and shift will happen, but our best guess is that is five to ten  years away for
    even progressive organizations. Ultimately, covered entities will bear the cost
    of data breaches and it is up to them to find a way to reduce that risk. The onramp
    to the cloud has already started and is has created new risks. Healthcare organizations
    need to get ahead of these risks as they continue to test and scale best of breed
    digital health solutions.\n \n"

  :summary: Our latest industry report takes a look at various opinions and definitions
    on public vs. private cloud computing within healthcare.
  :blog_lead: 'Last quarter, we published our first industry report titled [The Heart
    of Medicine: Transformation Through Technology](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around
    the topic of "cloud" within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between
    a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the
    cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress
    of digital health.'
  :post: |-
    Each quarter we will bring a similar report focused on a key topic related to healthcare technology. The shape of a report can take many forms. One quarter might be an extensive data study while another quarter might be an aggregation of industry views. Regardless of the style of report, the intent remains the same: Inform the digital health market with insights that can help them be successful. _There is no strategy without intelligence._

    Today we are happy to share our latest report titled [Public and Private Cloud Computing within Healthcare](https://datica.com/innovation/public-vs-private-cloud-computing-within-healthcare-summer-2017/). The premise of this report is simple: the debate between Public vs. Private cloud models is ongoing, yet many digital health companies we speak with aren't exactly sure their definitions, nor which model might be a fit for them. The [cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) is expansive and complex. This report is meant to help breakdown the differences between the two, and source industry insights related to what is a good fit for healthcare.

    Feedback is always welcome. Let us know what you think on Twitter at @daticahealth!

  :summary: 'As healthcare increasingly turns to cloud infrastructure, you might want
    to get to know the different service delivery models — SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. '
  :blog_lead: 'In a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in
    digital health, including [healthcare cloud trends](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    One of the interesting trends we discovered was that, within healthcare, the definition
    of cloud is no longer only scoped to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent
    past. In fact, healthcare companies are turning to cloud infrastructure services
    to help manage costs and increasing complexities. '
  :post: "> In 2017, [75% of hospital CIOs](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/)
    plan to use IaaS services within the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014.\"
    \n\nIn light of this trend, we thought it a good time to [once again](https://datica.com/blog/backend-as-a-service-or-platform-as-a-service-which-is-right-for-you/)
    define the three *service delivery models* prevalent in healthcare companies today.\n\n##
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) \nSaaS is a model for accessing an hosted application
    developed by a vendor. Typically, access is through a web app, mobile app, or
    an API. And it is is usually billed by user, API calls, or seats and billing is
    subscription-based. \n\nSubscription-based models have implications for customers
    because of the low capital expense to get started and implications for SaaS vendors
    because of the security issues and cost considerations. The classic example of
    SaaS is Salesforce CRM; Salesforce has moved into PaaS (Force.com) but it started
    as SaaS and still generates the bulk of its revenue from SaaS. There are literally
    tons of other SaaS vendors we all use daily — Box, Zendesk, MailChimp, Moz, Maketo,
    and Hubspot are just a few. In terms of customer control, this is the most limited
    delivery model of cloud computing.\n\n## Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) \n\nPaaS
    models allow you to deploy and scale your own application to cloud infrastructure
    without managing servers and/or databases. You may have some control over the
    infrastructure but it is limited. \n\nUsers of PaaS typically do not have access
    to the underlying operating system or network devices. Developers can focus on
    the application, written in a language of their choice, without worrying about
    building and maintaining the server to run it. The example most developers would
    think of is Heroku, which is part of Salesforce. There are others, like CloudFoundry
    and newer offerings like dotCloud. There is also a super cool compliant PaaS just
    for healthcare… yes, [Datica Platform](/platform/)\n\t\n## Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    (IaaS)\n\nThis as the blank slate of cloud computing that has been the driving
    disruptive force in computing over the last 15 years and is a huge [cloud focus
    for hospital CIOs in 2017](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).
    As opposed to SaaS and PaaS, which build layers of abstraction to interact with
    customers and keep them away from the OS, IaaS vendors provide customers with
    access to operating system and sometimes network components. \n\nYou can think
    of it as a hosted linux prompt. AWS and Rackspace are the prototypes for this.
    This is usually the cheapest option. It’s a blank slate, and developers can customize
    down to the OS level. With that control comes more responsibility and ultimately
    more time spent on infrastructure. The decision that needs to be made [in assessing
    IaaS](https://datica.com/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/) is whether time
    and resources should be spent configuring servers and databases, or does it make
    more sense to spend a little more money on infrastructure but have more resources
    for your core product and differentiation. Or, in other words, should you choose
    a PaaS offering or stay with IaaS? \n\nIf you plan on interacting with PHI in
    any other way beyond simply storing it, you would be wise to consider a PaaS like
    Datica. Our [Datica Platform](/platform/technology/) lets you move fast on the
    world’s leading infrastructure providers, like AWS or Microsoft Azure, while keeping
    the compliance folks happy."

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"

    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica.com/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    <figure>
    <script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/08ebxufc4q.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_08ebxufc4q seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>
    <figcaption>Datica Shared Responsibility Model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

  :blog_lead: It's the second day of [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
    and sessions are in full swing. I was able to attend several healthcare track
    sessions yesterday ([including Datica's](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/
    "Datica's AWS presentation")) and the future looks bright. Healthcare is poised
    to fully embrace the cloud in 2018. The sentiment in the market has changed and
    it truly feels like we're on the edge of a major shift in the approach healthcare
    organizations are taking when building and hosting their software.
  :post: |-
    Transitioning to today, the sessions were a bit different — but just as exciting. I attended three talks that discussed cutting edge fields that will have a major impact on healthcare in the next 5 to 10 years. Unlike healthcare's adoption of the cloud in 2018, these new technologies will likely take a bit longer, but that's not stopping us from getting excited.

    ![AWS services and partners](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/58k6RGB8ZOCOYA0eCqguaG/ded251d67b941cfce7ab20b66b4bde43/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__4_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The first session I attended was the __Global Partner Summit Keynote__, which was packed with several thousand attendees. We learned about several new initiatives and programs for Amazon Partners ([Datica is an APN member, as well as a healthcare competency partner](https://aws.amazon.com/health/healthcare-partners/#Datica)). These new changes will have a profound impact on how we work with our customers — from VPC sharing to new ways to integrate with the AWS marketplace. We'll be announcing new ways to take advantage of both Datica and AWS in the future.

    ![AWS Hyperledger Sawtooth Blockchain](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4rNlSQgtjaIuQYkUAI8iGU/7c052bd02b0d178e924d441a07801759/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__3_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    Session number two was entirely focused on [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSP-taqLWPQ) and blockchain technologies on AWS. We saw Intel present on [Sawtooth/Hyperledger](https://hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) (a competitor to [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)) which is governed by the Linux foundation. Healthcare veterans like PokitDok use Sawtooth to enable their blockchain technology, [DokChain](https://dokchain.com/). We're excited to watch blockchain technology grow within healthcare.

    ![AWS Neural networking](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6cDub9PA3KwQciuekA80IU/083cf25a67e696875daa420db63ea44e/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__2_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The last session of the day was on Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. This was by far the most exciting talk of the day. There are several real world use cases that make sense for both Datica and Datica customers. From menial tasks like filling out 1500+ question security questionnaires, to providing smart analytics and predictive scoring for compliance, machine learning is a very real topic that we're exploring deeply at Datica.

    If you were in attendance for any of the these sessions and want to chat about AI, Blockchain or how Datica provides an unparalleled compliance experience on AWS, stop by booth #519.

  :summary: The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules
    changed in late 2013 with the new HIPAA Omnibus that adds subcontractors entities.
  :post: |-
    Our mission is to help developers build health apps and technology. Specifically we want to offer tools and services to deal with the security and data challenges in healthcare. The major part of security in healthcare is HIPAA, and the HIPAA rules changed in late 2013 in ways that we've been planning for at Datica. The new HIPAA Omnibus ("omnibus" means something with several volumes or chapters, I didn't know that so I looked it up and thought I'd share) rules that went into effect on 9/23, amongst other changes, created a category of entities called subcontractors.

    Previously HIPAA rules only defined two categories of entities - covered entities and business associates. Covered entities are basically providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Business associates are basically entities that work with covered entities to perform a service or services to store, transmit, and/or process PHI. The new HIPAA rules expanded the number of categories of entities by 50% with the addition of subcontractors; for those of us in health tech, we think this is a pretty big deal.

    Subcontractors are entities that business associates use to process, create, or store PHI. Subcontractors don't have business associate agreements, or really any direct relationships, with covered entities; but, starting 9/23/2013, theses subcontractors need to have business associate agreements (BAAs) with business associates. It's all very obvious and confusing at the same time. Essentially you can think of subcontractors as a business associate of a business associate.

    The best examples of subcontractors we can think of are hosted services providers like Amazon Web Services, Datica, and Rackspace. Datica is a subcontractor for some of our customers and, as such, we do sign BAAs. We also act as a business associate directly for covered entities like enterprises, and sign BAAs in this capacity as well. We offer the same API-based services for developers in both circumstances, but the relationship is slightly different in the eyes of HIPAA.

    At Datica we know that subcontractors, as defined by HIPAA, have existed for a long time. As more health apps and services have shifted to hosted, or cloud based, and more infrastructure tools (app dev, logging, analytics, data collections, etc) have become mainstream, covered entities and business associates have begun to rely on "subcontractors". The new HIPAA rules now mean those subcontractors need to work with business associates to assure all parties are covered in terms of liability.

    This is a very exciting and major shift for health tech. HIPAA has finally acknowledged subcontractors and the role they play in creating, processing, and transmitting PHI. That's important for health tech to build smart, scalable, and interoperable tools. As a developer in healthcare, if you're considering acting as a business associate, or selling services to a covered entity, you need to understand if you fit into a certain entity category as defined by HIPAA.

    We encourage you to read the rest of the new [rules](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/01/20130117b.html), or at least one of the commentaries that covers them in more detail, to see about the other changes that are a part of the Omnibus rule. If you have any questions related to the new rules, where you potentially fit, and how we can help you mitigate your risk, shoot us an [email](mailto:hello@datica.io).

  :summary: Business associates and subcontractors need a HIPAA disaster recovery
    contingency plan in place to maintain the integrity of ePHI in case of a disaster.
  :post: |
    The HIPAA rules place great weight on the integrity of protected-health information. The reason is that protected-health information is something that's important for somebody's health - if they were to be in an accident or they were to need health services, the ability to look back at their health information, an informed clinical decision-making, management treatment, all of those things. Protected-health information is very, very important. As such, one of the required elements within the HIPAA security rule is around contingency planning.

    Section 164.308(a)(7)(i) of the HIPAA Security Rule states:

    >*Establish (and implement as needed) policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure, and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic protected health information.*

    What that means is planning for an outage, a disaster, or for some condition where systems' infrastructure databases are not accessible or damaged or in some other way not usable. It's crucial that business associates and subcontractors have policies and a HIPAA disaster contingency plan in place to assure that, in the case of a HIPAA disaster, so they can maintain the integrity of ePHI.

    A good example would be Hurricane Katrina. After the hurricane, locally stored health data was not redundant and available in other regions, and that data was not accessible immediately following the outages caused by Katrina. The VA, however, had data accessible from other regions so it was able to access data.

    The first step is developing a HIPAA disaster recovery (DR) plan. A DR plan outlines the process and plan in case there's a disaster - like a a fire, an explosion, or massive power outage (with failed power backup) – at the data center where your servers are stored. It could be a closet in your house; though, I certainly hope not for physical security reasons. Most likely, which is the case with Datica, your contingency plan for disaster involves a rack at a data center somewhere. DR is about planning for what might happen if that data center, for whatever reason, is inaccessible or unusable.

    The first step is in actually assuring that you have thorough backups; so backing up your data, settings, and configurations on a very regular basis is very important for DR. We replicate data to another geographic region and automate the provisioning and "stand-up" scripts using tools like [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) across providers to assure availability in the case of a disaster. Note that the DR environment doesn't need to be an exact copy of your production environment (although you could choose it to be so). DR doesn't require you to have a "hot" standby either, i.e. an exact copy of your environment (load balancers for high availability, multiple application, and database nodes, etc.) as having this "hot" environment always available is expensive. Ultimately, your HIPAA disaster recover requirements are driven by trade-offs that you are willing to make between cost and possible down time. The key inputs into that decision are:

    - How mission critical is your application? Directly impacts patient care for example.

    - What could your revenue impact be for downtime? And what have you committed to in your SLAs to your customer - the business (within enterprises) or to enterprises (if you are a vendor)

    Once you have a good backup strategy and plan in place that you've implemented and tested to assure that they're accessible, the next step is assuring you have a process and plan in place for how you would initiate using those backups. Typically, a DR policy defines the roles of the people that are going to be involved in recovering from a disaster and the key steps in communication that need to take place. Usually there is, as a part of a HIPAA disaster recovery plan, a plan for an emergency setup. How do you reconfigure and redeploy your infrastructure in a new data center or into a new environment that might not be optimal (maybe no high availability, for example)? The next step is how you actually migrate back to the environment that your infrastructure was in originally, if that infrastructure can be reinstated or reused.

    Disaster recovery and actual backups are very important, and both are things that are not that fun to do. They take time, and there are resources that need to be dedicated to actual backups. With Datica, we work with you to solve that section of HIPAA. We have a backup process that we can quickly implement unless you already have one in place or would like to incorporate what you've already set up in to the process we have.  We have a very detailed disaster recovery contingency plan that covers all the elements outlined above. We ensure that if something happens to your infrastructure, which we are managing for you, we can stand it back up.

    When it comes to the disaster contingency plan requirement, not only do we meet the technical safeguards and provide you with the technical infrastructure and the tools pre-built to do it, we also have the policy in place for it; and our policy has been assessed by a third party auditor. As an organization and Datica customer, if you're developing your own HIPAA policies, you can inherit or use our HIPAA disaster recovery policy in its entirety. It is essentially your DR policy.

  :lead: |-
    HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is very heavy on technology. Encryption of PHI while in transit, disaster recovery—these are intense technical considerations.

    Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and policy. While it's true major technological considerations exist—for example, don't store plaintext passwords!–components like Access Control Lists (ACLs) and credentialing are just as important as far as HIPAA goes.
  :post: |+
    Here are a few domains to consider related to HIPAA compliance within a digital health application.

    ## Credentials and provisioning
    The value of a digital health product is the personal experience bestowed upon each user. That can't happen without authentication and authorization.

    Authentication is one of the primary threat vectors from malicious network actors, so getting it right is a major part of compliance. Often an existing enterprise already has an LDAP or Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism in place, so a digital health application will need to integrate with those on a customer-by-customer basis.

    Don't forget with onboarding new users that all communication here must be compliant and secure. For example, don't share passwords or PHI via email, and understand how email is one of the most exploitable threat vectors that exist in today's enterprise technology climate.

    Rotating passwords is a compliance requirement, so implementing a plan which helps users reset their password regularly and securely is a requirement.

    ## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    Access Control Lists, or ACLs, are a concept that manages what data can be seen by which users. ACLs are enormously complicated because there are many variables: People, roles, geography, employment, BAAs, plus many more factors. Being uncalibrated either way can be disastrous: On one side, you might get angry users who are upset they are blocked from seeing some data they should see. On the other side, if too much data is exposed, you violate HIPAA compliance and those people are even angrier. The former results in users not wanting to use your product and giving bad word-of-mouth recommendations, while the latter results in bad press and potentially lawsuits.

    Administration of ACLs has many dimensions. For example, an ACL could change situationally by user role and location.

    ACLs are managed at the application level and are a major part of HIPAA compliance.

    ## Usage audits
    Continuous auditing at the infrastructure and application levels is a requirement for compliance. At the infrastructure level, it’s things like process logging. At the application level, it's things like tracking which authenticated user saw what data when.

    Proper app audits track who saw what and when. Keep in mind these [audit logs need to be stored](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) in a compliant way as well since it's probable the logs have PHI in them.

    ## Technical considerations
    The good news about compliance at the application level is there are few "gotcha's" with regards to technology and security. Simply put, if the product is secure, then it will be compliant. The basics you would do whether you are in healthcare or not will cover HIPAA.

    For example, don't store plain text passwords. Ensure you don't leave open any form vulnerabilities which expose your database (good old [Bobby O'DROP_TABLE](http://bobby-tables.com/) will never die). Elements of that nature.

    If you do the basics all application developers should do anyways, you'll be compliant.

    ## Proving compliance at the application level
    Which leads to how to prove compliance.

    At the infrastructure level, it's easy—and common—to find a partner who does most the work. Maybe you are deployed directly on AWS and handle most of the compliance obligations yourself. Maybe you utilize [Datica's platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) to satisfy the entirety of HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level. The point is it's possible and common to let someone else take care of compliance at that level for you. The end result is _they_ will prove compliance on your behalf. For example, Datica is HITRUST CSF Certified and had 3 independent audits. Leveraging that is how you prove compliance at the infrastructure level.

    But the fact of being a digital health company, and the very nature of building an application, means _you_ own this level. You can't hand off the risks and compliance obligations to someone else. Consequently, it's on _you_ to prove compliance.

    The good news is it's possible. The bad news is it's not free.

    In short, the best way to prove compliance at this level is to get your company audited by an independent auditor, who will examine your company in totality, or the app specifically.

  :summary: What exactly is multi tenant cloud and does Datica Compliant Cloud offer
    a multi tenant environment?
  :lead: Datica provides HIPAA compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified hosting and integration
    solutions for a variety of customers. These HIPAA and HITRUST audits have been
    performed by a national third party [(*Coalfire*)](https://coalfire.com). In the
    case of HITRUST, we have been through additional scrutiny in the context by the
    certifying authority, namely [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).
  :post: |2+

    As we continue to grow our customer base, we get asked about Datica being a multi-tenant solution and the supposed security challenges that could perhaps arise because of that. We felt that it made sense for us to write up this "position paper" on multi-tenancy and security. Our hope is that this post will clarify our security posture and provide others with a few pointers on better security practices.

    ## The cloud by definition is multi-tenant

    One of the first things to note is that in the modern cloud computing world, **everything** is multi-tenant. All the IaaS providers you use such as Google, MSFT, AWS and Rackspace are multi-tenant. All the SaaS companies that you know and use, such as Salesforce, Intuit and Stripe are multi-tenant. But before we discuss how multi-tenancy and security are not orthogonal, it would be worthwhile to explain tenancy in the cloud context so that we are all on the same page.

    In cloud computing, tenancy generally refers to how the platform (PaaS or Platform as a Service) and underlying infrastructure (IaaS) are shared among different customers. Before we explore this further, let's setup an analogy. Let's setup an apartment building with multiple rental units (tenants). The building itself can be compared to an IaaS (bricks, mortar etc.). The building comes with property management i.e. shared water pump, utilities management (electricity, sewage, garbage collection and so on) and maintenance. Property management can be considered equivalent to a Platform as a Service (Datica Compliant Cloud) i.e. a service that takes care of the details so that the renter (tenant) doesn't have to. Given that analogy, let's dig a bit deeper.

    ### A multi-tenant cloud is where all customers share the same cloud infrastructure. This does not mean that customers can see each other’s data.

    Going back to the analogy, it is the property management organization's responsibility to ensure that Jane Appleseed's key for apartment 101 does not allow her access to apartment 102. She only has access to her occupancy. But she only has one garage door opener with a code specific to her but managed centrally. Similarly, it is the Platform's (Datica Compliant Cloud's) role to ensure that a tenant only has access to their environment (apartment) and associated services (rooms and garage).


    ### Shared infrastructure automatically places a greater emphasis on security. Access to the multi-tenant environment is strictly controlled and customers get a view of **only** their data.

    In the analogy, this requirement forces the property management group (PaaS provider) to plan for separate mailbox keys, tracking users of those keys, correlating keys with the occupants of the apartment, having a doorman to prevent the random pizza guy from entering the building and so on. Living in a building with a doorman is much more secure than an automated buzz-someone-in system. This is what Datica Compliant Cloud manages and maintains on an ongoing basis. We also hire external penetration testers on an annual basis, scan our networks weekly, perform penetration tests internally on a quarterly basis and track possible security breaches as part of our service.

    ### The benefit of a multi-tenant model is that the provider can **maintain** a shared infrastructure for all customers.

    Customers benefit from always being on the latest version of all underlying software - the OS (operating system), the databases, webservers, etc. In the unlikely event that one of our customers learns about a problem before we do, we can immediately take action and ensure that the appropriate fixes get put into place quickly for all our customers. When it’s time to upgrade Datica Compliant Cloud, all of our customers are upgraded at the same time and share the same experience. In the analogy, if property management decides to replace the aging solar panels with more performant ones, all of your tenants get the benefits at the same time. Maintenance is a significant cost not only to the service provider but also to the customer so the easier and cheaper it is, the better off all parties will be. Or in other words...

    > The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases. — Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy

    For example, Salesforce.com, at the relatively high end of the multi-tenancy spectrum, has 72,500 customers who are supported by 8 to 12 multi-tenant instances (meaning IaaS/PaaS instances) in a 1:5000 ratio. Said differently, each multi-tenant instance supports 5,000 tenants who share the same database schema. Intacct, a financial systems SaaS provider in the middle of the spectrum, has more than 2,500 customers who share 10 instances in a 1:250 ratio. [Source](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2517005/data-center/multi-tenancy-in-the-cloud--why-it-matters.html)

    At Datica, we go several steps more to ensure our customers security and isolation.

    - AppArmor profiles: ensure that containers are isolated as much as the underlying operating system allows.
    - Encryption in-transit: ensures that even **within** your environment, all network traffic is encrypted with customer specific keys
    - Encryption at-rest: enforces all volumes are encrypted
    - Customer specific app, database (and cache): are specific to each customer and never shared.
    - Dedicated logging  and monitoring for each customer: to reduce your costs while ensuring your environment remains compliant.
    - Dedicated networking: to assure isolation of all traffic on a per customer basis.

    This is essentially no different from you managing your own set of containers on a IaaS provider. At Datica, our goal is to simplify infrastructure and compliance so that you can focus on your application features and your customers.

  :summary: With ePHI access, business associates are required to sign a HIPAA business
    associate agreement (BAA). Learn more about business associate agreements here.
  :post: |-
    The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of cloud computing companies.

    Business associates are people or organizations who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required to sign what's called a business associate agreement (BAA). Below is the actual language from HIPAA 164.308.

    * (b)(1) Business associate contracts and other arrangements. A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity's behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

    * (2) A business associate may permit a business associate that is a **subcontractor** to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on its behalf only if the business associate obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with §164.314(a), that the subcontractor will appropriately safeguard the information.

    Business associate agreements are basically legal contracts that outline the ways in which business associates follow HIPAA, as well as the responsibilities and risks that the business associate takes on. They typically defines the type of services that the business associate is providing, the type of data that they are interacting with, states that they will follow HIPAA and not disclose PHI without authorization. They also should address areas around breach notifications and penalties. Traditionally, pre-cloud and prior to the HIPAA Omnibus changes of 2013, BAAs were boiler plate. Here's the [template BAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/contractprov.html) from HHS.

    Business associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon that definition of business associate to include something called subcontractors. Subcontractors are typically service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for the covered entities. With subcontractors and APIs and SaaS, there is now a chain of entities touching ePHI in some way, and each of them need to have BAAs in place that are consistent and not contradictory to one another. As an example, a business associate selling to hospital A can't have a breach notification policy of less than 24 hours if the hosting provider they use has a physical breach notification policy of 2 months.

    As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos, more and more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, considered subcontractors. These subcontractors have to sign business associate agreements with business associates, who in turn have to sign a business associate agreement with covered entities. That's actually a very common use case for us at Datica, where most of our early customers are business associates, and their customers are covered entities.

    We spent a lot of time and a lot of money with our attorneys on our BAAs because this is a new area, an area we don't think is well defined yet; we don't think the existing BAA templates are adequate or even make sense for most hosted vendors. In this new paradigm of health technology there are interesting definitions around which entities are responsible, both technically and financially in the case of a breach, for different aspects of the HIPAA rules. We tell our prospective customers to read their current business associated agreements that they have with their hosting providers or other services companies to get a sense of what the legal responsibility is for the business associate and the aspects to which the subcontractor is ultimately. Regardless of who is issuing the BAA, you should read through it in detail because at some point a compliance or security officer likely will read it and you want to be as proactive about compliance issues as you can.

    If you boil it down, business associate agreements are just contracts that outline the ways in which different organizations are going to handle electronic protected health information (ePHI), the types of responsibilities that those organizations take on, some of the very specific rules around their obligations with regards to HIPAA. This last one, the obligations of subcontractors, is an area in which you want to pay close attention. Specifically read what the subcontractors obligations are in terms of timeliness of breach notification, because that was a part of the changes in the HIPAA Omnibus Rule that just went into effect. We have had several early customers come to us because the time period for breach notifications with their existing hosting provider is not acceptable for covered entities they are selling into. We've talked to several companies that have run into roadblocks with enterprises because their business associate agreements with their hosting providers had been out of line, and especially relating to breach notification. Our policy at Datica is breach notification within 4 hours, along with some very detailed [plans](https://catalyze.io/hipaa#notification-in-the-case-of-breach---13402(a)-and-13402(b)) to help you mitigate the risk of a breach.

    At a high level, that's what business associate agreements are and you are expected to have those for all of the various technology and services companies that you work with that might in some way interact, process, store, or have access to ePHI. If you're a business associate or you're a covered entity, we happily sign BAAs. And if you're interested in seeing one of our BAAs, [email us](mailto:legal@datica.com) and we'll walk you through ours and answer any questions you might have about it.
