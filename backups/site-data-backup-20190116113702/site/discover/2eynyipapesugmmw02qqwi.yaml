  There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

  Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

  Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
  data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
  to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure and
  scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive amounts
  of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n### Healthcare
  Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most feasible
  way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to face the challenge
  of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
  to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs are high and
  data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA Compliance in
  the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
  and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s. These regulations
  were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve the health insurance
  system. If you have a healthcare application, website or data storage, you must
  be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting. \n\n<div class=\"callout

  What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
  is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
  Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting is
  necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any scenario
  as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
  Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
  Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
  Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
  provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
  healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
  partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
  Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of healthcare
  processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare entities to utilize
  resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals understand that cloud
  computing has its advantages but many have data security concerns about moving to
  a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security are considered the most
  serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout

  Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
  Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
  to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure the
  confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if encryption
  is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted, it’s hard
  to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that encryption
  of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification is classified
  as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption when seen
  as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n* The HHS
  is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be prepared
  to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited, your documentation
  will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If an entity does a proper
  risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption is not “reasonable
  and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is not very likely the
  victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that it not necessary.
  So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory, the majority of healthcare
  professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n## How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare
  Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud provider, it is vital for an organization
  to perform due diligence to ensure the ePHI they are entrusting this provider with
  will be secured in accordance with the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant
  healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/) ask these key questions:\n* Have
  they had an external assessment done by a third party?\n* Have they been assessed
  against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance can they make in safeguarding
  your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the business associate agreement?\n\nIn
  most instances, cloud providers should be able to provide evidence of a third party
  HIPAA compliance assessment, such as HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes
  digital health in the cloud a reality by removing the risks that prevent its adoption.
  We turn HIPAA compliance on public infrastructure providers into a solved problem,
  and enable secure clinical data exchange between mission-critical digital health
  applications and EHR systems. Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from
  digital health startups and industry leaders to health systems across the nation.
  More than 300 customers and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST
  certified and data securely interoperable.\n\n"

  :summary: Private, Public, and Hybrid clouds all exist in healthcare. Hybrid clouds
    represent the largest area of growth in healthcare organizations.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

    <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">

    </a>

    We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
  :post: |+
    ## Shift to IaaS

    For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

    Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

    The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

    * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
    * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

    That's a remarkable jump.

    ## Data Data Everywhere

    The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

    Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

    Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

    ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

    What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

    The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

    The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

    ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

    |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
    |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
    |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
    |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
    |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
    |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

    ## What this means to healthcare

    We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

    We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"

    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

  :summary: By now you've heard of the CloudFlare leak of sensitive data. There's
    a specific part of HIPAA legislation that health care should be concerned about.
  :blog_lead: |-
    By now you've likely heard of the [CloudFlare parser bug](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) that caused CloudFlare's CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, [a serious problem](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/834900838837411840), or [a historic event](https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/834905083976552449).

    At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/guide/hipaa/). Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?

    As it turns out there's a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.
  :post: "## The Conduit Exception\n\n[We've written in the past](https://datica.com/academy/the-hipaa-privacy-rule/)
    how the [Omnibus rule for HIPAA](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),
    introduced in 2013, has affected companies doing business in the healthcare industry.
    One important clarification made in the Omnibus rule is additional guidance around
    what does and does not fall under HIPAA and the conduit exception.\n\nThe conduit
    exception was introduced for reasons of practicality. In effect, the exception
    states that no legal agreements are required between covered entities and organizations
    that merely act as \"conduits\" for ePHI.\n\nIn the physical world this makes
    a lot of sense. Without this exception it would be impossible for your doctor
    to discuss health issues over the phone or send medical bills over postal mail.\n\nThings
    become a little blurrier in the electronic world. What exactly is the difference
    between an organization/service acting as a conduit for information and an organization/service
    acting as a business associate?\n\nAccording to the [legal wording](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),\n\n>
    … data transmission organizations that do not require access to protected health
    information on a routine basis would not be treated as business associates. This
    is consistent with our prior interpretation of the definition of \"business associate,\"
    through which we have stated that entities that act as mere conduits for the transport
    of protected health information but do not access the information other than on
    a random or infrequent basis are not business associates.\n\nThis is further clarified
    with:\n\n> The conduit exception is a narrow one and is intended to exclude only
    those entities providing mere courier services, such as the U.S. Postal Service
    or United Parcel Service and their electronic equivalents, such as, internet service
    providers (ISPs) providing mere data transmission services. As we have stated
    in prior guidance, a conduit transports information but does not access it other
    than on a random or infrequent basis as necessary to perform the transportation
    service or as required by other law.\n\nSo the final rule clearly calls out ISPs
    as falling under the conduit exemption and that a \"random or infrequent basis\"
    is the dividing line. This is a logical extension of the physical examples given
    earlier.\n\n## Are CDNs Exempt?\n\nUnfortunately, the final rule does not cover
    CDN services explicitly. Let's consider some of the cases where using a CDN makes
    sense and map them to the guidelines above.\n\nOne typical use for CDNs is to
    place static content geographically closer to end users, for example, static HTML
    or Javascript libraries. These are obviously not ePHI but often fall under HIPAA
    for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, if you have a web application and are dynamically
    loading Javascript from a CDN, and if that CDN were ever compromised, any maliciously-injected
    code could feasibly be used to exfiltrate ePHI out of your application. If you're
    not cryptographically verifying the content downloaded from the CDN you are opening
    up yourself to attack vectors. In this case, the CDN would _definitely_ not be
    covered by the conduit exemption; after all, it is storing executable code on
    your behalf.\n\nAnother use involves using the CDN to proxy an application server,
    essentially acting as a global caching layer. Some CDNs claim that because they
    offer encryption support (HTTPS), and they are simply acting as a path for cached
    information, they are exempt under the conduit exception. Unfortunately this argument
    is invalid and falls apart under scrutiny.\n\nSome CDNs require you to upload
    a copy of your HTTPS certificate and private key in order to get HTTPS support.
    In this case, if that certificate is also used to protect ePHI, this is _definitely_
    not covered by the conduit exception. You are providing keying material that can
    be used to decrypt sensitive information. Not only would this fall under HIPAA
    legislation, this is bad security hygiene.\n\nEven if the CDN uses a separate
    HTTPS certificate and private key, if it is acting as a proxy in front of a health-related
    application the CDN's servers will likely receive, decrypt, and transmit ePHI.
    In contrast with an ISP the CDN will have access to ePHI on much more than a \"random
    or infrequent\" basis.\n\nAdditionally, simple metadata related to some websites
    may be sensitive. How would you feel if leaked HTTP request logs showed a username
    that corresponds with your Twitter handle visiting an intensely personal website
    such as [a disease-focused dating site](https://www.mpwh.com/)? Depending on what
    information is tracked in the request URLs, even web server access logs may inadvertently
    contain ePHI.\n\nOne can picture data centers full of HTTPS frontends silently
    processing data that may contain sensitive information. Given that the CDN staff
    has administrative access to those machines, how can you be sure any ePHI that
    happens to traverse through their network is being properly protected? What legal
    actions do you have in case it is not being handled correctly?\n\n## The Importance
    of the BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n\nThese issues were some of the key
    motivators for introducing the concept of the [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements),
    or BAA. In HIPAA, these legal agreements are used for a few important reasons:\n\n1.
    To clearly define expectations around how both parties follow HIPAA regulations,
    particularly around how data containing ePHI will be managed.\n2. To delineate
    the risks and responsibilities between both parties, particularly around breach
    notifications and penalties.\n\nWithout such a legal agreement in place allowing
    a third party to access data containing ePHI is a risky proposition. How will
    you know if data is being properly protected? If a security incident happens related
    to ePHI for your customers, how you will be notified so you can take appropriate
    actions?\n\nIf there is no agreement in place there is not a clear legal course
    of action to take in the event of a breach. In fact, given the way HIPAA regulations
    are enforced, without a BAA **you will be liable for any mistakes made by that
    third party.**\n\nThe fiscal repercussions of being on the hook for a breach caused
    by a third party is compelling enough for organizations to ensure that any services
    they use are covered under a BAA. But more importantly, the legal framework of
    the BAA means that you will have done at least a token amount of due diligence
    in protecting your customer's ePHI data. Allowing sensitive data to flow through
    a third party without such diligence is irresponsible and shows a complete lack
    of respect for your customer's basic privacy rights.\n\nOr as Gene Fry [summarized
    so succinctly](http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/hipaa-conduit-exception-rule/):\n\n>
    Any provider that states they are fully HIPAA compliant will sign a BAA with you,
    and if they don’t, you’re putting your organization and patients’ data at risk.\n\n##
    Impact of the CloudFlare Breach\n\nGiven the scale at which CloudFlare operates,
    the impact of this breach will likely take a long time to fully flesh out. While
    [CloudFlare reacted quickly to respond to this breach](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139)
    it will take some time to regain the trust they lost with this catastrophic mistake.\n\nTo
    the best of our knowledge CloudFlare has never offered a BAA for their customers,
    which means that any organization that used CloudFlare's CDN capabilities with
    ePHI needs to start invoking their breach procedures **now.** We hope all such
    organizations do the right thing and help protect any sensitive data entrusted
    to them by their customers.\n\n*Learn more about how [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud)

  :summary: HHS released its official Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing last month.
    The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask.
  :blog_lead: |-
    HHS released it's official [Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing][1] last month. The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask. In some ways, it's HHS playing catchup to the industry. The cloud, while still early in terms of adoption in healthcare, is already heavily used for creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting ePHI. Look no further than [athenahealth][2], one of the largest EHR providers, for an example of a lot of ePHI in the cloud. Storing or moving data around different cloud-based services is becoming more and more commonplace.

  :post: |
    > A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity. - Dalai Lama

    Personally, I think HHS could and should play a more active and significant role in trends like cloud computing. I acknowledge it's hard to keep up with pace of technology in healthcare but there's still more HHS could do to engage with those leading these technical charges. That said, it's good to have official guidance from HHS.

    Yesterday I jointly conducted a webinar with [Coalfire][3]. Today I will recap some of the highlights, and pull out the salient points from the guidance and summarized them below. (_Note: CSP stands for cloud service provider._)

    * **Lacking encryption keys doesn't prevent you from being liable under HIPAA.** From the guidance, _This is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules._ This has been a claim by some CSPs and this is one of the most clear and relevant aspects of the HHS guidance. The claim by some CSPs is that, by not having the keys to decrypt ePHI, they are not a subcontractor or business associate. HHS says they are because they still store receive and maintain, even if that ePHI is encrypted and the CSP does not have the key to decrypt it. CSPs that fall into this bucket at considered _no-view services_ by HSS.
    * **But lacking keys does change obligations.** From the guidance, _In particular, where only the customer controls who is able to view the ePHI maintained by the CSP, certain access controls, such as authentication or unique user identification, may be the responsibility of the customer, while others, such as encryption, may be the responsibility of the CSP business associate._ This is the first I've seen HHS acknowledge—implicitly, at least—the concept of compliance inheritance for HIPAA. At Datica, we [pioneered][4] the concept of inheritance and still feel strongly that compliance inheritance is the best path to securing data, reducing risk of breach, and complying with HIPAA, in a cloud-based world.
    * **Lacking keys it could change breach reporting.** From the guidance, _If the ePHI that has been breached is encrypted consistent with the HIPAA standards set forth in 45 CFR § 164.402(2) and HHS' Guidance [13](#) the incident falls within the breach "safe harbor" and the CSP business associate is not required to report the incident to its customer._ This is significant as it changes breach reporting requirements for no-view CSPs, and breach reporting is a big part of HIPAA and a big part of what covered entities want to understand about their business associates and partners.
    * **All types of cloud configurations are ok for HIPAA.** From the guidance, _…while a covered entity or business associate may use cloud-based services of any configuration (public, hybrid, private, etc.), [3](#) provided it enters into a BAA with the CSP, the type of cloud configuration to be used may affect the risk analysis and risk management plans of all parties and the resultant provisions of the BAA._ NIST [defines][5] different cloud deployment models. The most common are public and private, or some mix of those two that NIST defines as hybrid. Organizations can comply with HIPAA using any deployment model but there are different risks associated with each and it is the job of the covered entity and business associate to properly assess the risk when selecting the proper deployment model. I would have preferred HHS go further and call out [single-tenant and multi-tenant in regards to HIPAA and cloud][6].
    * **SLAs need to align with BAAs.** From the guidance, _If a covered entity or business associate enters into a SLA with a CSP, it should ensure that the terms of the SLA are consistent with the BAA and the HIPAA Rules._ This is something that many business associates don't do but should. The core of this guidance is that the SLA from a CSP should ensure that access to ePHI is not restricted due to excessive downtime.
    * **Security and breach reporting should be very specifically defined.** From the guidance, _The Security Rule, however, is flexible and does not prescribe the level of detail, frequency, or format of reports of security incidents, which may be worked out between the parties to the business associate agreement (BAA)._ With ePHI moving between CSPs (think APIs and [Blank-as-a-Service][7]), it's imperative that each party knows what it is responsible for reporting. Reporting is essential to investigating and shutting off breaches.
    * **Cloud service providers do not need to store ePHI for some period of time.** From the guidance, _No, the HIPAA Rules generally do not require a business associate to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI) beyond the time it provides services to a covered entity or business associate._ This [not news][8] to us but it something that is frequently misunderstood about HIPAA so it's good that HHS called this out for CSPs.
    * **It's ok to use servers outside the USA.** From the guidance, _Yes, provided the covered entity (or business associate) enters into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the CSP and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules._ This surprised me a little. Not because I don't agree with HHS but because I have a hard time imagining the use case for this. We have global customers, particularly in the life sciences arena, who need global deployments. In those cases, we deploy separate apps and databases across different regions depending on where end users reside. All customers we have that work with US citizens are deployed in US data centers.
    * **Documentation of security practices is not required from cloud service providers.** From the guidance, _The HIPAA Rules do not expressly require that a CSP provide documentation of its security practices to or otherwise allow a customer to audit its security practices._ This type of documentation, while not required, may still be needed by covered entities and business associates based on the their determination of risk.

    ## What was not in the guidance?

    I think a few things were missing and that HHS didn't go far enough.

    1. **Define compliance inheritance.** I think HHS could go further here. HITRUST is a [good example][9] by incorporating the concept of inheritance into the CSF. Inheriting aspects of HIPAA is a core part of cloud deployments and should be addressed by HHS.
    2. **Address questions about multi-tenancy.** This is probably the most frequent question when it comes to ePHI + cloud. It would have been good to have official guidance as a part of the cloud guidance from HHS.
    3. **Start moving towards a universal, readable BAA.** The BAA [template][10] that HSS has on it's site, while useful in its generalizability, is too broad. There are things we know about the cloud and one of them, related to inheritance above, is that different parties can own different obligations. Creating a universal BAA, even if HHS is just the convener of industry leaders, would go a long way to helping healthcare move to the cloud in a safe way.

    Healthcare, and it's data and applications, are slowly but surely embracing the cloud. The recent guidance from HHS has gotten a lot of attention. Hopefully this summary was helpful. If you have any other questions, reach out to us at [hello@datica.com][11].

  :summary: What are the essential characteristics of cloud computing? As we work
    with cloud-based vendors and enterprises in healthcare, we're constantly fielding

  :post: |-
    As we work with cloud-based vendors and enterprises in healthcare, we're constantly fielding questions related to cloud deployments and models. This is our attempt to summarize what we've learned.

    I think we all *know* what cloud computing is, or at least we have certain associations and benefits that come to mind for the term “cloud computing”. NIST has a formal definition of cloud computing. NIST breaks down cloud computing into 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, and 4 deployment models.

    The **Essential Characteristics** of cloud computing include:

    1. **On-demand self-service.** Pretty straightforward. Users of cloud computing are able to provision computing resources (CPU cycles, storage, bandwidth etc) themselves. You can think of the AWS dashboard as the perfect example of this; if you’ve used AWS, you know exactly what I mean.
    2. **Broad network access.** Cloud computing resources can be utilized by remote clients using standard mechanisms. I think most modern developers think of web apps and APIs for this.
    3. **Resource pooling.** Computer resources are shared. Models like multi-tenancy and virtual machines are used to achieve this. The idea is that resources are dynamically shared, both up and down, between cloud deployed apps. This can present problems in the case of “noisy neighbor”, where your virtual neighbors are consuming and restricting access to resources. Hosting companies are pretty good at identifying and resolving these issues. But often not, which is why once companies begin to scale to larger volumes, dedicated instances become more interesting.
    4. **Rapid elasticity.** This is extremely powerful as it enables apps to scale up cloud computing resources as needed, on demand, to support peaks and troughs of usage. Instead of having to build and support high powered services 24/7, those services and resources will scale as needed.
    5. **Measured service.** Usage is metered, and cloud computing is typically billed on a per use basis. In the case of pure infrastructure, like AWS, you have little to no wasted money because you are only paying for what you consume. Consumption can include bandwidth, CPU cycles, storage, user accounts, API calls, etc.

    Most of these you probably knew of intuitively but, for us, it’s helpful to lay them out. We find there is a lot of confusion, especially in healthcare, about what cloud computing is, who’s using it, and why it is appealing relative to other models of computing. Much of the confusion comes into play when people interchange the terms virtualized computing and cloud computing; virtualized computing is often used synonymously with private cloud. Virtualized hosted environments do not typically allow for self service or automated resource pooling, two of the *essential* characteristics form above.

    The next categorization for cloud computing relates to the amount of control of the underlying resources. Which leads us to back to the NIST defined **Service Models**, which are laid out below:

    1. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS.** SaaS is a model for accessing an hosted application developed by a vendor. Typically access is through a web app, mobile app, or an API. And it is is usually billed by user, API calls, or seats and billing is subscription-based. Subscription-based models have implications for customers because of the low capital expense to get started and implications for SaaS vendors because of the high negative upfront cash flow outlay to grow (more on this in a later post). The classic example of SaaS is Salesforce CRM; Salesforce has moved into PaaS (Force.com) but it started as SaaS and still generates the bulk of its revenue from SaaS. If you’re a mobile developer you likely know Parse, Urban Airship, and Twilio. There are literally tons of other SaaS vendors, several of which we use at Datica - Box (just made the move from another SaaS - Dropbox), Zendesk, MailChimp, Intercom, Mailgun, Moz, and Close.io. This is the most limited, at least in terms of customer control, model of cloud computing.
    2. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).** PaaS models allow you to deploy and scale your own application to cloud infrastructure without managing servers and/or databases. You may have some control over the infrastructure but it is limited. Users of PaaS typically do not have access to the underlying operating system or network devices. Developers can focus on the application, written in a language of their choice, without worrying about building and maintainer the server to run it. The example most developers would think of is Heroku, which is part of Salesforce. There are others, like CloudFoundry and newer offerings like dotCloud. There is also a super cool compliant PaaS that recently launched that's called...yes, Datica!
    3. **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).** I think of this as the blank slate of cloud computing that has been the driving disruptive force in computing over the last 15 years. As opposed to SaaS and PaaS, which build layers of abstraction to interact with customers and keep them away from the OS, IaaS vendors provide customers with access to operating system and sometimes network components. You can think of it as a hosted linux prompt. AWS and Rackspace are the prototypes for this. This is usually the cheapest option. It's a blank slate, and developers can customize down to the OS level. With that control comes more responsibility and ultimately more time spent on infrastructure. The decision that needs to be made in assessing IaaS is whether time and resources should be spent configuring servers and databases, or does it make more sense to spend a little more money on infrastructure but have more resources for your core product and differentiation. Or in other words, should you choose a PaaS offering or stay with IaaS.

    In addition to service models, which basically define the level of control customers have over infrastructure, there are also **Deployment Models**, listed below, which define the group to which cloud computing resources are shared.

    1. **Private cloud.** Most often confused with virtualization, private cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by one entity, and can be on or off premise. This is the direction most larger enterprises will move to, including within healthcare. Datica maintains a compliant private cloud. The challenge with most current private cloud deployments is that they provide none of the capabilities that a public cloud (see below) provides such as auto-scaling, API based access to perform a host of tasks etc.
    2. **Community cloud.** In this deployment, infrastructure is shared with a group, or community, of users. We think of this as a shared private cloud, and it’s usually a community that has something in common. With Datica, we have a HIPAA compliant private cloud in which we host our community of customers; the commonality in our community is that our customers are concerned about compliance, so we’ve painstakingly created a compliant environment with multiple private private networks. Customers get their own private networks within the Datica cloud.
    3. **Public cloud.** This is the infrastructure that developers know best. In this deployment, the infrastructure is for public use. Pretty simple.
    4. **Hybrid cloud.** This is where things get interesting. In this deployment, there is a mix of two different models from above. Hopefully using Datica will provide a good example use case. We have a private cloud - Datica manages and maintains the cloud computing resources and it’s exclusive to us. For our customers, we set up private networks within our private cloud, so our private cloud is actually a community cloud for our customers. Additionally, we’re beginning to explore using public cloud resources for certain, non-compliant things such as code sets. In non-compliant deployments, if more resources are needed, such as the case with spikes in usage and/traffic, private clouds will burst into public clouds to gain access to additional cloud computing resources. Key here is to ensure that "post burst", the additional capacity that was spun up, needs to be powered down else month end bills could be a bit surprising.

    The reason we care about cloud computing, including the definition and characteristics of it, is that we firmly believe the benefits of cloud computing have not been realized in healthcare. And we believe much of that relates to a lack of understanding of what cloud computing is, and how cloud computing can be both compliant and secure. Current compliant offerings in healthcare, especially when you look at compliant cloud computing service models, sorely miss the needs of modern app app developers and the industry as a whole; we make the important distinction between PaaS and IaaS, and believe PaaS is the necessary approach to be compliant because of the myriad of compliance requirements beyond dedicated infrastructure. More to come on service models and compliance in a future post.

    to obtain medical information sought after, primary care workflows can be expedited,
    but what does this mean for data security?
  :post: |-
    Risks always follow new technologies. For instance, a tablet may be easily stolen or misplaced. If that tablet has the personal information of several hundred patients stored on it, the unknown whereabouts could lead to lawsuit settlements with insurmountable financial repercussions. Therefore, hospitals must be wary about how they are collecting, storing and protecting the information on their patients.

    Storing data on mobile devices does make it easier to access data, but it also increases the risk of the same data falling into wrong hands if the device is misplaced. It really does not matter much if the data on the device was encrypted or not. Patients (and the judicial system) care more about the actual loss of personal information rather than the loss of the technology itself on which the information was stored. Therefore, being able to protect data itself is a much better proposition for ensuring the safety of patient records. Putting data on secure cloud applications is one way of minimizing risks from theft, provided it cannot be downloaded into any type of computer.

    Cloud service providers that store data securely in multiple places minimize the risk of data loss due to catastrophic natural disasters, sabotage or destruction. Redundancy is assured when the healthcare information is stored on primary database servers along with a backup database server. Providers ensure that customer's data can be replicated to database servers in real-time during disaster recovery operations.

    For healthcare services to attain this level of data, security would turn out to be extremely expensive and administratively very difficult. It would detract from the healthcare provider's primary functionality of caring for their patients. However, when a cloud service provider offers security, it is less expensive as the implementation is usually on a large scale. On one hand, the healthcare industry gets security at affordable prices and on the other, it is not burdened with maintaining a service that is not its core strength.

    Although the cloud hosts and protects medical information, the control remains with the hospital. With support from the cloud service provider, hospitals can ensure a role-based security system for accessing the data. Users can have different levels of access based on their roles within the hospital's organization. Security breaches become easier to prevent, as specific people now require different levels of security clearance. The hospital can choose to employ role-based security for preventing an employee from unwittingly altering or accessing information that he or she is not permitted to because of their specific function.

    From their side, cloud service providers offer a host of security features that their customers can utilize. For ensuring compliance to HIPAA, there are password complexity requirements, verification questions and session lockouts. Providers typically store user passwords with one-way hashing algorithms, while logging user entries with date, time and source IP address. The logs are maintained for a minimum of 30 days to ensure tracking and security.

    The emergence of HIPAA-compliant cloud storage has raised the bar of providing a complete solution for improved performance and security for the service providers. The improved access to information stored on HIPAA-compliant cloud simplifies switching and leads to more savings for the medical facilities.

  :summary: As we roll into the end of 2017, it's worth looking back on how the industry
    has been doing protecting PHI against the threat of cyber-intrusions.
  :blog_lead: 'As we roll into the last few months of the year, it''s worth looking
    back on how the industry has been doing protecting PHI and adapting to the increasingly
    threatening world of cyber-intrusions. While the big stories generally revolve
    around the largest amount of lives impacted and the most technically harrowing
    attacks, it''s worth noting that there are still breaches as simple as someone
    stealing a laptop with a spreadsheets with thousands of persons worth of PHI on
    it. In this article, we''re going to go through some of the largest breaches of
    2017 and discuss how we address these as a company which we''ve shared in our
    open-source policies. While it''s impossible to say in retrospect if any breach
    was 100% preventable, having policies in place to provide "reasonable effort"
    to prevent exposure is key to minimizing the damage from the unpreventable. '
  :post: "## Ransomware or Malware\n\nAt top of mind in 2017 is ransomware and malware,
    which shut down and exposed multiple hospitals and HIT Vendors thoughout the year.
    Of those, two were notable:\n\n-  [Pacific Alliance Medical Center attack potentially
    leaks 260K patients](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/los-angeles-provider-breached-ransomware-attack-over-260000-patients-affected-updated)\n-
    \ [Nuance Impacted for Weeks Due to Malware](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cybersecurity/cyber-attack-update-nuance-still-down-researchers-believe-petya-not)\n\nThe
    vector of the attack is relatively straightforward: through phishing or infected
    3rd party hardware like a thumb drive, hackers gain access to hardware throughout
    an organization's network and encrypt data on that hardware. The purpose of ransomware
    is to extract payment to undo that encryption while other malware like the ones
    believed to be used in the Nuance attack are wholly irreversible and are just
    designed to effectively destroy the data.\n\nPreventing something like an attack
    like this actually hits to the heart of most of our policies, but let's go for
    the top 3 references in this article. First, [patch management](https://policy.datica.com/#9.5-patch-management-procedures)
    ensures that you are constantly being vigilant to new security concerns. While
    it's not directly stated in our policies, we have one person and a backup who
    are wholly responsible for managing patches for our system for security concerns.
    Second, having policies on [appropriate system access and by reducing the need
    for privledged users](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification)
    reduces the risk that if one user's credentials are compromised all systems could
    be accessible by an attacker. Third, we run [OSSEC and Anti-Virus](https://policy.datica.com/#17.4-prevention-of-malware-on-production-systems)
    on all production systems to identify any otherwise unknown attacks and to solve
    any issues brought up from an attack.\n\n## Unauthorized Access or Disclosure\n\n-
    [Indiana Medicaid warns patients of health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/indiana-medicaid-warns-patients-health-data-breach)\n-
    [Phishing attack at UC Davis leads to health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phishing-attack-uc-davis-health-breaches-data-15000-patients)\n\nOther
    than a vector for malware, [phishing](https://datica.com/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/)
    can also be used as a method for attackers to simply gain access to systems by
    getting credentials to a system. Or, a well-meaning dev may accidentally breach
    patient data by placing it on a public facing web page. \n\nWhile your mileage
    may vary, our policies have a few tips to help prevent this. First, we require
    [two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#17.7-production-system-security)
    on all production systems. While this doesn't necessarily prevent a system user
    from giving an attacker their credentials *and* auth token (sigh), it reduces
    the risk of unauthorized cross application access and minimizes the window by
    which an attacker can maintain access to an application. We also require access
    to all production systems to be [managed over a VPN with two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
    We also have an unofficial \"All data is potentially PHI\" policy for our managed
    integration services hardware/software. While we may have access to test environments
    with mock patient data, we assume that we may be sent PHI from any vendor or healthcare
    organization. As such, we protect all data like PHI as established in our policies.
    \n\n## Theft or Improper Disposal\n\n- [WSU hard drive theft potentially impacts
    1 million people](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/wsu-hard-drive-theft-potentially-impacts-1-million-people)\n-
    [State Employee Dumps Medicaid Worksheets in dumpster](http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/state-employee-dumps-medicaid-worksheets-in-dumpster/article_13f36eb4-1fb4-5278-93e1-1d30a00c9f9a.html)\n\nWhile
    hackers and ransomeware are increasingly perilous, [20% of data breaches reported
    to the OCR are good old fashioned theft and improper disposal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
    Someone stealing a laptop from a car or a unencrypted hard drive from an office
    to cause a breach are a tale as old as HIPAA itself.\n\nWe may be biased, but
    **stop storing PHI on local machines or on paper**. [We don't](https://policy.datica.com/#7.13-access-to-ephi).
    We only used [approved tools](https://policy.datica.com/#20.-approved-tools-policy)
    with appropriate access controls and encryption to store and transfer PHI. We
    also have [no servers in our offices](https://policy.datica.com/#10.-facility-access-policy)
    and BAAs with our cloud providers. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon't [learn about HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    the hard way, either getting beat up by your first 250-question audit or worse:
    by finding yourself on the OCR's Wall of Shame. Consult our policies or let us
    do the lifting for you on our thrice-audited, HITRUST-certified [compliant Platform](https://datica.com/platform/).

  :summary: Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away
    but it's happening now as healthcare embraces SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :blog_lead: Something interesting has been happening in healthcare over the last
    several years. While we’ve been focused on meaningful use, EHRs, and Obamacare,
    healthcare has quietly started to [embrace the cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/).
    Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away. But
    it hasn’t been. In many ways, it’s happened the same way it happened in other
    industries — through data connections between on-premise legacy systems and new
    cloud-based solutions. Just like many enterprises embraced the cloud over the
    last 15 years with Salesforce, so too are healthcare enterprises embracing new
    SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :post: " \n## Data is in the Driver’s Seat\n \n**Healthcare’s onramp to the cloud
    is about data**, not about [lifting and shifting](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/feature/When-to-adopt-the-lift-and-shift-cloud-migration-model)
    legacy systems out of hospital data centers and into the cloud. And, the nature
    of the cloud enables a paradigm shift in the types of solutions that are succeeding.
    Digital health technologies, the major drivers of the future of health IT, are
    being selected *based on the best* of breed model, not *one size fits all* model
    of the [monolithic EHRs](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    that have proliferated and dominated health IT resources for the last fifteen
    years. This swing back to best of breed is important because it opens the door
    for new, highly-targeted and highly-valuable solutions to flourish. Healthcare
    is letting a thousand digital health flowers bloom. On the flip side, this new
    model also creates a ton of noise in the industry that champions and decision
    makers at healthcare enterprises have to wade through.\n \nDon’t get me wrong,
    there are still bottlenecks to the onramp, most notably data integration and,
    most frequently, a non-technical problem; but, even integration is becoming a
    solved problem (FHIR, new APIs, new knowledge transfer, and open source tools
    to educate and jumpstart integrations, etc). [EHR integration](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    is certainly easier to solve than setting up and managing a host of digital health
    applications on premise.\n \n## Beware of the Data Security Risks\n \nBut, this
    type of onramp to the cloud does create a new set of risks for healthcare organizations.
    **The data onramp, in many ways, is more risky than lift and shift.** The data
    being shipped to the cloud is health data and the stewards of that health data
    are [covered entities](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (mostly health systems and insurance companies). This data isn’t contact information
    for sales prospects going into Salesforce. Privacy and security are always important
    but, in healthcare, there is a significant financial risk if you get them wrong.\n
    \nThe risk is compounded as healthcare organizations work with more and more cloud-based
    digital health solutions, as is now happening in the best of breed model that
    has emerged. The challenge in healthcare is that HIPAA is loosely defined at best,
    and loosely audited at worst. So a healthcare organization may work with ten different
    digital health solutions and all ten of those solutions may be on the same cloud
    provider, say AWS for this example, but every one of those digital health solutions
    addresses [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and
    data security in different ways. This makes it nearly impossible for healthcare
    organizations to maintain a consistent data governance posture and, maybe more
    importantly, to understand the their current risk of breach or security incident.\n
    \n## Cloud Cybersecurity Depends on Consistency\n \nSomething we often hear from
    healthcare organizations is that they have a mix of cloud-based solutions that
    are connected to their EHRs. These solutions can include applications built in
    house, applications built by development groups contracted by the organization,
    and SaaS applications developed and supported from 3rd party vendors. Chances
    are every one of those instances is secured and managed differently. At Datica,
    we run a fleet of 500+ cloud hosts across multiple data centers, running many
    different applications and technology stacks. All of those hosts and networks
    are audited and assessed on an ongoing basis. Trust us when we say that **doing
    cybersecurity in the cloud, consistently and continually, is non-trivial.** And
    it’s our [core expertise](https://datica.com/compliance/)!\n \nThese data risks
    are mitigated to some extent in the lift and shift model as the cloud is managed
    and configured in a standard way for technologies [migrating to the cloud](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).
    But, that’s not the model we have in healthcare for the foreseeable future; lift
    and shift will happen, but our best guess is that is five to ten  years away for
    even progressive organizations. Ultimately, covered entities will bear the cost
    of data breaches and it is up to them to find a way to reduce that risk. The onramp
    to the cloud has already started and is has created new risks. Healthcare organizations
    need to get ahead of these risks as they continue to test and scale best of breed
    digital health solutions.\n \n"

  :summary: Our latest industry report takes a look at various opinions and definitions
    on public vs. private cloud computing within healthcare.
  :blog_lead: 'Last quarter, we published our first industry report titled [The Heart
    of Medicine: Transformation Through Technology](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around
    the topic of "cloud" within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between
    a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the
    cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress
    of digital health.'
  :post: |-
    Each quarter we will bring a similar report focused on a key topic related to healthcare technology. The shape of a report can take many forms. One quarter might be an extensive data study while another quarter might be an aggregation of industry views. Regardless of the style of report, the intent remains the same: Inform the digital health market with insights that can help them be successful. _There is no strategy without intelligence._

    Today we are happy to share our latest report titled [Public and Private Cloud Computing within Healthcare](https://datica.com/innovation/public-vs-private-cloud-computing-within-healthcare-summer-2017/). The premise of this report is simple: the debate between Public vs. Private cloud models is ongoing, yet many digital health companies we speak with aren't exactly sure their definitions, nor which model might be a fit for them. The [cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) is expansive and complex. This report is meant to help breakdown the differences between the two, and source industry insights related to what is a good fit for healthcare.

    Feedback is always welcome. Let us know what you think on Twitter at @daticahealth!

  :summary: 'As healthcare increasingly turns to cloud infrastructure, you might want
    to get to know the different service delivery models — SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. '
  :blog_lead: 'In a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in
    digital health, including [healthcare cloud trends](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    One of the interesting trends we discovered was that, within healthcare, the definition
    of cloud is no longer only scoped to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent
    past. In fact, healthcare companies are turning to cloud infrastructure services
    to help manage costs and increasing complexities. '
  :post: "> In 2017, [75% of hospital CIOs](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/)
    plan to use IaaS services within the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014.\"
    \n\nIn light of this trend, we thought it a good time to [once again](https://datica.com/blog/backend-as-a-service-or-platform-as-a-service-which-is-right-for-you/)
    define the three *service delivery models* prevalent in healthcare companies today.\n\n##
    Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) \nSaaS is a model for accessing an hosted application
    developed by a vendor. Typically, access is through a web app, mobile app, or
    an API. And it is is usually billed by user, API calls, or seats and billing is
    subscription-based. \n\nSubscription-based models have implications for customers
    because of the low capital expense to get started and implications for SaaS vendors
    because of the security issues and cost considerations. The classic example of
    SaaS is Salesforce CRM; Salesforce has moved into PaaS (Force.com) but it started
    as SaaS and still generates the bulk of its revenue from SaaS. There are literally
    tons of other SaaS vendors we all use daily — Box, Zendesk, MailChimp, Moz, Maketo,
    and Hubspot are just a few. In terms of customer control, this is the most limited
    delivery model of cloud computing.\n\n## Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) \n\nPaaS
    models allow you to deploy and scale your own application to cloud infrastructure
    without managing servers and/or databases. You may have some control over the
    infrastructure but it is limited. \n\nUsers of PaaS typically do not have access
    to the underlying operating system or network devices. Developers can focus on
    the application, written in a language of their choice, without worrying about
    building and maintaining the server to run it. The example most developers would
    think of is Heroku, which is part of Salesforce. There are others, like CloudFoundry
    and newer offerings like dotCloud. There is also a super cool compliant PaaS just
    for healthcare… yes, [Datica Platform](/platform/)\n\t\n## Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    (IaaS)\n\nThis as the blank slate of cloud computing that has been the driving
    disruptive force in computing over the last 15 years and is a huge [cloud focus
    for hospital CIOs in 2017](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).
    As opposed to SaaS and PaaS, which build layers of abstraction to interact with
    customers and keep them away from the OS, IaaS vendors provide customers with
    access to operating system and sometimes network components. \n\nYou can think
    of it as a hosted linux prompt. AWS and Rackspace are the prototypes for this.
    This is usually the cheapest option. It’s a blank slate, and developers can customize
    down to the OS level. With that control comes more responsibility and ultimately
    more time spent on infrastructure. The decision that needs to be made [in assessing
    IaaS](https://datica.com/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/) is whether time
    and resources should be spent configuring servers and databases, or does it make
    more sense to spend a little more money on infrastructure but have more resources
    for your core product and differentiation. Or, in other words, should you choose
    a PaaS offering or stay with IaaS? \n\nIf you plan on interacting with PHI in
    any other way beyond simply storing it, you would be wise to consider a PaaS like
    Datica. Our [Datica Platform](/platform/technology/) lets you move fast on the
    world’s leading infrastructure providers, like AWS or Microsoft Azure, while keeping
    the compliance folks happy."

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: What exactly is multi tenant cloud and does Datica Compliant Cloud offer
    a multi tenant environment?
  :lead: Datica provides HIPAA compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified hosting and integration
    solutions for a variety of customers. These HIPAA and HITRUST audits have been
    performed by a national third party [(*Coalfire*)](https://coalfire.com). In the
    case of HITRUST, we have been through additional scrutiny in the context by the
    certifying authority, namely [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net).
  :post: |2+

    As we continue to grow our customer base, we get asked about Datica being a multi-tenant solution and the supposed security challenges that could perhaps arise because of that. We felt that it made sense for us to write up this "position paper" on multi-tenancy and security. Our hope is that this post will clarify our security posture and provide others with a few pointers on better security practices.

    ## The cloud by definition is multi-tenant

    One of the first things to note is that in the modern cloud computing world, **everything** is multi-tenant. All the IaaS providers you use such as Google, MSFT, AWS and Rackspace are multi-tenant. All the SaaS companies that you know and use, such as Salesforce, Intuit and Stripe are multi-tenant. But before we discuss how multi-tenancy and security are not orthogonal, it would be worthwhile to explain tenancy in the cloud context so that we are all on the same page.

    In cloud computing, tenancy generally refers to how the platform (PaaS or Platform as a Service) and underlying infrastructure (IaaS) are shared among different customers. Before we explore this further, let's setup an analogy. Let's setup an apartment building with multiple rental units (tenants). The building itself can be compared to an IaaS (bricks, mortar etc.). The building comes with property management i.e. shared water pump, utilities management (electricity, sewage, garbage collection and so on) and maintenance. Property management can be considered equivalent to a Platform as a Service (Datica Compliant Cloud) i.e. a service that takes care of the details so that the renter (tenant) doesn't have to. Given that analogy, let's dig a bit deeper.

    ### A multi-tenant cloud is where all customers share the same cloud infrastructure. This does not mean that customers can see each other’s data.

    Going back to the analogy, it is the property management organization's responsibility to ensure that Jane Appleseed's key for apartment 101 does not allow her access to apartment 102. She only has access to her occupancy. But she only has one garage door opener with a code specific to her but managed centrally. Similarly, it is the Platform's (Datica Compliant Cloud's) role to ensure that a tenant only has access to their environment (apartment) and associated services (rooms and garage).


    ### Shared infrastructure automatically places a greater emphasis on security. Access to the multi-tenant environment is strictly controlled and customers get a view of **only** their data.

    In the analogy, this requirement forces the property management group (PaaS provider) to plan for separate mailbox keys, tracking users of those keys, correlating keys with the occupants of the apartment, having a doorman to prevent the random pizza guy from entering the building and so on. Living in a building with a doorman is much more secure than an automated buzz-someone-in system. This is what Datica Compliant Cloud manages and maintains on an ongoing basis. We also hire external penetration testers on an annual basis, scan our networks weekly, perform penetration tests internally on a quarterly basis and track possible security breaches as part of our service.

    ### The benefit of a multi-tenant model is that the provider can **maintain** a shared infrastructure for all customers.

    Customers benefit from always being on the latest version of all underlying software - the OS (operating system), the databases, webservers, etc. In the unlikely event that one of our customers learns about a problem before we do, we can immediately take action and ensure that the appropriate fixes get put into place quickly for all our customers. When it’s time to upgrade Datica Compliant Cloud, all of our customers are upgraded at the same time and share the same experience. In the analogy, if property management decides to replace the aging solar panels with more performant ones, all of your tenants get the benefits at the same time. Maintenance is a significant cost not only to the service provider but also to the customer so the easier and cheaper it is, the better off all parties will be. Or in other words...

    > The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases. — Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy

    For example, Salesforce.com, at the relatively high end of the multi-tenancy spectrum, has 72,500 customers who are supported by 8 to 12 multi-tenant instances (meaning IaaS/PaaS instances) in a 1:5000 ratio. Said differently, each multi-tenant instance supports 5,000 tenants who share the same database schema. Intacct, a financial systems SaaS provider in the middle of the spectrum, has more than 2,500 customers who share 10 instances in a 1:250 ratio. [Source](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2517005/data-center/multi-tenancy-in-the-cloud--why-it-matters.html)

    At Datica, we go several steps more to ensure our customers security and isolation.

    - AppArmor profiles: ensure that containers are isolated as much as the underlying operating system allows.
    - Encryption in-transit: ensures that even **within** your environment, all network traffic is encrypted with customer specific keys
    - Encryption at-rest: enforces all volumes are encrypted
    - Customer specific app, database (and cache): are specific to each customer and never shared.
    - Dedicated logging  and monitoring for each customer: to reduce your costs while ensuring your environment remains compliant.
    - Dedicated networking: to assure isolation of all traffic on a per customer basis.

    This is essentially no different from you managing your own set of containers on a IaaS provider. At Datica, our goal is to simplify infrastructure and compliance so that you can focus on your application features and your customers.

  :summary: While HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is heavy on technology,
    HIPAA Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and
    policy.
  :lead: |-
    HIPAA Compliance at the infrastructure level is very heavy on technology. Encryption of PHI while in transit, disaster recovery—these are intense technical considerations.

    Compliance at the application level is more of a blend of technology and policy. While it's true major technological considerations exist—for example, don't store plaintext passwords!–components like Access Control Lists (ACLs) and credentialing are just as important as far as HIPAA goes.
  :post: |+
    Here are a few domains to consider related to HIPAA compliance within a digital health application.

    ## Credentials and provisioning
    The value of a digital health product is the personal experience bestowed upon each user. That can't happen without authentication and authorization.

    Authentication is one of the primary threat vectors from malicious network actors, so getting it right is a major part of compliance. Often an existing enterprise already has an LDAP or Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism in place, so a digital health application will need to integrate with those on a customer-by-customer basis.

    Don't forget with onboarding new users that all communication here must be compliant and secure. For example, don't share passwords or PHI via email, and understand how email is one of the most exploitable threat vectors that exist in today's enterprise technology climate.

    Rotating passwords is a compliance requirement, so implementing a plan which helps users reset their password regularly and securely is a requirement.

    ## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    Access Control Lists, or ACLs, are a concept that manages what data can be seen by which users. ACLs are enormously complicated because there are many variables: People, roles, geography, employment, BAAs, plus many more factors. Being uncalibrated either way can be disastrous: On one side, you might get angry users who are upset they are blocked from seeing some data they should see. On the other side, if too much data is exposed, you violate HIPAA compliance and those people are even angrier. The former results in users not wanting to use your product and giving bad word-of-mouth recommendations, while the latter results in bad press and potentially lawsuits.

    Administration of ACLs has many dimensions. For example, an ACL could change situationally by user role and location.

    ACLs are managed at the application level and are a major part of HIPAA compliance.

    ## Usage audits
    Continuous auditing at the infrastructure and application levels is a requirement for compliance. At the infrastructure level, it’s things like process logging. At the application level, it's things like tracking which authenticated user saw what data when.

    Proper app audits track who saw what and when. Keep in mind these [audit logs need to be stored](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) in a compliant way as well since it's probable the logs have PHI in them.

    ## Technical considerations
    The good news about compliance at the application level is there are few "gotcha's" with regards to technology and security. Simply put, if the product is secure, then it will be compliant. The basics you would do whether you are in healthcare or not will cover HIPAA.

    For example, don't store plain text passwords. Ensure you don't leave open any form vulnerabilities which expose your database (good old [Bobby O'DROP_TABLE](http://bobby-tables.com/) will never die). Elements of that nature.

    If you do the basics all application developers should do anyways, you'll be compliant.

    ## Proving compliance at the application level
    Which leads to how to prove compliance.

    At the infrastructure level, it's easy—and common—to find a partner who does most the work. Maybe you are deployed directly on AWS and handle most of the compliance obligations yourself. Maybe you utilize [Datica's platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) to satisfy the entirety of HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level. The point is it's possible and common to let someone else take care of compliance at that level for you. The end result is _they_ will prove compliance on your behalf. For example, Datica is HITRUST CSF Certified and had 3 independent audits. Leveraging that is how you prove compliance at the infrastructure level.

    But the fact of being a digital health company, and the very nature of building an application, means _you_ own this level. You can't hand off the risks and compliance obligations to someone else. Consequently, it's on _you_ to prove compliance.

    The good news is it's possible. The bad news is it's not free.

    In short, the best way to prove compliance at this level is to get your company audited by an independent auditor, who will examine your company in totality, or the app specifically.

  :summary: Business associates and subcontractors need a HIPAA disaster recovery
    contingency plan in place to maintain the integrity of ePHI in case of a disaster.
  :post: |
    The HIPAA rules place great weight on the integrity of protected-health information. The reason is that protected-health information is something that's important for somebody's health - if they were to be in an accident or they were to need health services, the ability to look back at their health information, an informed clinical decision-making, management treatment, all of those things. Protected-health information is very, very important. As such, one of the required elements within the HIPAA security rule is around contingency planning.

    Section 164.308(a)(7)(i) of the HIPAA Security Rule states:

    >*Establish (and implement as needed) policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure, and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic protected health information.*

    What that means is planning for an outage, a disaster, or for some condition where systems' infrastructure databases are not accessible or damaged or in some other way not usable. It's crucial that business associates and subcontractors have policies and a HIPAA disaster contingency plan in place to assure that, in the case of a HIPAA disaster, so they can maintain the integrity of ePHI.

    A good example would be Hurricane Katrina. After the hurricane, locally stored health data was not redundant and available in other regions, and that data was not accessible immediately following the outages caused by Katrina. The VA, however, had data accessible from other regions so it was able to access data.

    The first step is developing a HIPAA disaster recovery (DR) plan. A DR plan outlines the process and plan in case there's a disaster - like a a fire, an explosion, or massive power outage (with failed power backup) – at the data center where your servers are stored. It could be a closet in your house; though, I certainly hope not for physical security reasons. Most likely, which is the case with Datica, your contingency plan for disaster involves a rack at a data center somewhere. DR is about planning for what might happen if that data center, for whatever reason, is inaccessible or unusable.

    The first step is in actually assuring that you have thorough backups; so backing up your data, settings, and configurations on a very regular basis is very important for DR. We replicate data to another geographic region and automate the provisioning and "stand-up" scripts using tools like [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) across providers to assure availability in the case of a disaster. Note that the DR environment doesn't need to be an exact copy of your production environment (although you could choose it to be so). DR doesn't require you to have a "hot" standby either, i.e. an exact copy of your environment (load balancers for high availability, multiple application, and database nodes, etc.) as having this "hot" environment always available is expensive. Ultimately, your HIPAA disaster recover requirements are driven by trade-offs that you are willing to make between cost and possible down time. The key inputs into that decision are:

    - How mission critical is your application? Directly impacts patient care for example.

    - What could your revenue impact be for downtime? And what have you committed to in your SLAs to your customer - the business (within enterprises) or to enterprises (if you are a vendor)

    Once you have a good backup strategy and plan in place that you've implemented and tested to assure that they're accessible, the next step is assuring you have a process and plan in place for how you would initiate using those backups. Typically, a DR policy defines the roles of the people that are going to be involved in recovering from a disaster and the key steps in communication that need to take place. Usually there is, as a part of a HIPAA disaster recovery plan, a plan for an emergency setup. How do you reconfigure and redeploy your infrastructure in a new data center or into a new environment that might not be optimal (maybe no high availability, for example)? The next step is how you actually migrate back to the environment that your infrastructure was in originally, if that infrastructure can be reinstated or reused.

    Disaster recovery and actual backups are very important, and both are things that are not that fun to do. They take time, and there are resources that need to be dedicated to actual backups. With Datica, we work with you to solve that section of HIPAA. We have a backup process that we can quickly implement unless you already have one in place or would like to incorporate what you've already set up in to the process we have.  We have a very detailed disaster recovery contingency plan that covers all the elements outlined above. We ensure that if something happens to your infrastructure, which we are managing for you, we can stand it back up.

    When it comes to the disaster contingency plan requirement, not only do we meet the technical safeguards and provide you with the technical infrastructure and the tools pre-built to do it, we also have the policy in place for it; and our policy has been assessed by a third party auditor. As an organization and Datica customer, if you're developing your own HIPAA policies, you can inherit or use our HIPAA disaster recovery policy in its entirety. It is essentially your DR policy.

  :summary: Dr. Chris Wadsen discussed the types of tensions found in organizations,
    and which can be found in healthcare. This interview is packed full of insight
    and thoughtful discussion!
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Failure should be separated into two types: "mindless" and "mindful" failures. You want the latter.
    2. Of the three types of tension, the third—"Creative Tension"—is the one where true, step-function innovation is found.
    3. New data being created from wearables and other sensors are a major area of future innovation.
  :post: |-
    **Catalyze:** Thank you, Chris so much for joining us today. Excited to talk to you about innovation and specifically some of the topics that you cover in your new book – _Tension: The Energy of Innovation_. One of the topics in the book that you talk about is failure, and failure being the spark that ignites the innovation cycle, but considering specifically startups, there’s an incredibly high failure rate, whether you call it a failure, pivots or whatnot. I’m curious about failure and pivots and how startups can use that to ignite their success.

    **Dr. Wasden:** I differentiate between mindless failure and mindful failure. Through mindless failure we march off and think we are right, create something, but we never really ask the market; we never look for pain points and never try to get to root cause of failure. We never try to understand how our solution will eliminate that tension between the current state and the desired state. Then, we launch into the market and are surprised that it failed. Well, that’s a mindless failure. We really didn’t think mindfully about what needed to be done, nor did we go and talk to 100 different people that have this problem to understand how to solve the problem.

    If you look at diabetes as an example, there are apparently over 400 diabetic apps on the app store. Ninety-nine percent of them are awful and this is because they were never designed to be very effective. They are based upon someone’s very limited understanding of diabetes. They might be diabetic themselves, but also never understanding how to harness the technology in a novel way that would really eliminate the route cause of the pain that people have, which is the failure.

    I’m currently working on an I-Corps™ grant with a team at the University of Utah, and one of the requirements of an I-Corps grant is that you have to do at least 100 face-to-face interviews with stakeholders within your problem set that you are trying to focus on. You are not trying to sell them your technology, but to understand what the pain points are they are experiencing. Then from that, trying to understand what sort of solution you need to create to eliminate that failure and pain. That’s what I think most of the failures are about. They are not trying to be mindful in going about this. They are not asking 100 people in face-to-face interviews what really needs to be addressed. They are coming out because they can develop apps very quickly and inexpensively with what they think of as an app or solution.

    Now, if you look at WellDoc as an example, they’ve done a lot of the right stuff. They have peer-reviewed research that shows their app is two and a half more times effective than the best drug. They have economic research that shows they can save $1500 to $1800 dollars a year for a health plan. They’ve still had many failures though. So just because you do a lot of this doesn’t mean that you won’t fail. They’ve done lots of pivots. They initially came out and thought that this would be so effective and so compelling that people would just run to it. What they found is that generally people aren’t going to use an app like that unless somebody else pays for it, because that is the model we live in within healthcare. Even if you know it is going to be effective, you still expect someone else to pay for it.

    So then they pivoted and said, "If that’s not going to work then maybe we need other channels of distribution," so they partnered with AT&T and others that have hundreds of millions of customers. AT&T is a mobile company and this is a mobile app; they’ve got lots of employees that are diabetic. WellDoc did a pilot study with AT&T and found out that AT&T employees performed much better with this app than without it. They had evidence that they were right. But still they couldn’t get traction because AT&T is not the right channel to distribute this to health plans or to employers. They then pivoted again, saying well, maybe we need to be more like a drug. If we are two and a half times better than a drug, maybe we need to be on an app formulary, so that the payers will view us like a drug and doctors can prescribe us. That’s given them more success and they started to get some payment levels. But even there was interesting.

    I had a prescribing WellDoc doctor on a panel at the mHealth Summit and we had this conversation:

    “How many diabetic patients do you have?”

    “Five hundred, “ explained the doctor.

    “Great, so you prescribe WellDoc 500 times?”

    “No, I’ve prescribed it about 50 times,” he responded.

    “WOW. Why only 50 times when you have 500 diabetics?” I asked.

    “The reality is…not all my diabetics have a big problem,” he said. “Their pains are not that great, because there are different levels and stages of diabetes. It’s a great solution, very effective, no question about it. But it’s very expensive, so I’m only going to prescribe to those patients that have a severe enough diabetic problem that it’s worth paying $100 to 150 dollars a month for the WellDoc solution.”

    This is the sort of work we have to go through to become great innovators. And it is not easy; it’s very painful, creates lots of tension, and causes lots of different pivots to do that.

    **Catalyze:** You talked about the numbers that WellDoc has for savings on a per-patient basis and there are a few companies that have effectively done that, like Propeller and Omada Health, and some others. Does WellDoc have granular data where they’ve actually segmented the diabetes population? Have they actually done that sort of segmentation so that it is not on the gestalt of the provider to say, “Well, this is a severe diabetic and they need this.” Versus saying, “Well you are pretty well managed?”

    **Dr. Wasden:** That level of sophistication is part of their algorithm, so they can drive people toward some sort of intelligent machine learning approach to change their behavior. Then they’ve stepped-wise to say, “Well how do we do that same sort of thing to make the sale to a health plan or an employer that our solution will, if you were to stratify this risk population of diabetics…how do we stratify and then how do we think about prescribing it to which type of patients?"

    That’s not where they started, but these are the failures that allow you to learn and then from learning, you figure out how to better apply it.

    **Catalyze:** I think it is one of the things that as a funded company, there’s just so much pressure to be massive and to talk about the total addressable markets. There is this tendency to throw everything out there, before you end up segmenting what is potentially your total addressable market, but segmenting it. With each segment, there are multiple cohorts and I imagine the data, selling and pricing on each is different.

    **Dr. Wasden:** Here’s the challenge. This is part of what we go through with this I-Corps program that I’m part of. There are different synonyms for the word “tension.” You used the word “pressure” – pressure is a synonym for tension. The real tension you have as a funded company is that no VC is going to fund you unless they think you can become a billion dollar opportunity. To raise $100 million dollars, unless you are going to be a billion dollar company, it’s not going to work out. So you have the one tension, which is that you’ve got to present that you are a billion dollar opportunity, but on the other side I can’t think of very many technologies that were able to succeed by launching in a big market. You almost always have to launch into the very small, narrow niche market. In fact, if you look at Clayton Christensen’s work on _The Innovator’s Dilemma_, that’s really the key finding of his work. You have a new technology and a new paradigm. You have a company that comes along and it doesn’t attack the big, main market; it goes after some niche market that the big market offering can’t really address well. Over time as it gets better and better, it then gets into the big market.

    I have experience with this phenomenon and with my own medical device company. I invented a new technology to diagnose/treat hearing loss. Hearing loss effects 20 percent of the U.S. population. Primary care doctors do not get involved with diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss today. My idea was, what if I got 300,000 primary care doctors to use an automated diagnostic tool to now diagnose the 20 percent of the U.S. population with hearing loss? That would be a huge market with great opportunity.

    We got through the FDA process, we go to market and then to primary care doctors, and they say, “I would never buy your product.”

    We asked, “Why?”

    “How many ENT doctors use your product?” they questioned.

    “None,” we replied.

    “Well until an ENT doctor uses a diagnostic hearing testing device, I will never use it.”

    So then we considered which ENT market we should go after? Which ENT doctors have the most audiologists? Obviously the answer was big ENT practices. So we go there and ask, “How would you like to fire your audiologist and buy our device and save lots of money?”

    “I would never fire any of my audiologists,” they responded.

    We replied, “We’ve got this workflow benefit and whatnot...”

    “Look,” they replied. “Audiologists are critical, not only to diagnosing hearing loss but to treating it, because half the patients are going to be treated with a hearing aid and I need to have them dispense it.”

    Okay, strike two! Then we went to our first medical device conference in San Diego. We were on the showroom floor and ended up having a lot of individual ENT practices buy our device. We asked, “What is the value proposition for you?”

    They said, “Well look at this. Audiologists are in short supply; the ones that I have only work part-time. What you enable me to do is to diagnose hearing loss 24/7 365. That’s something a human can’t do for me. The other thing is that I have lots of patients that speak more than one language, so I have to be able to diagnose in multiple languages. Your device diagnoses in 11 languages and, that’s pretty valuable to me. The more high value activity for my audiologist is for her to dispense the hearing aid; it’s not doing the test. Your product frees her up from doing the boring, mundane work and allow her to do the higher value added work.”

    We found out for the one- and two-man practice, our device was great. We sold a couple hundred of devices to them. Then after we sold a lot to them, big practices realized they could use some swing capacity. Their audiologists would sometimes be completely consumed and they wouldn’t necessarily fire anyone, but if they had one or two of our devices, they had some extra capacity, and the multi-language stuff had value. Then once we did that, some smart ENT doctors said, “I should buy your device and put it in a primary care doctor’s office, because they could then diagnose hearing loss and they could refer them all to me.”

    Suddenly we started getting in the primary care market, but we got to that market last, not first. We had to find the ones that had the real pain in the marketplace and go to them first, because they would run to our technology. Whereas the ones that only had modest pain, which were the larger practices, would tiptoe or walk towards it. And, the primary care doctors would only do it if, it was promoted by those that were the prominent practices that really used this type of technology. I think all new technologies follow that same path.

    **Catalyze:** Are there other types of tension that you think founders or entrepreneurs need to be thinking about and would play into their innovative process and how they actually get to market and succeed?

    **Dr. Wasden:** My doctoral dissertation was on taxonomy of tension. I looked at the types of tensions that are out there, and then how those tensions impact the innovative or creative effort. At it’s core, I found there were three cardinal tensions that we deal with on a day-to-day basis.

    1. Maladaptive tensions – those that are created by failure and pain and perpetuate themselves as failure and pain.
    2. Adaptive tensions – those are something that allows us to transform maladaptive tensions into things that are just a bit better.
    3. Creative tensions – those things that are step changes. They make things 2x, 5x 10x better.

    Every type of tension requires a different type of structure or practice to have it operate. Let me give you an example with biking.

    A. If you have a chain on your chain ring and the chain is really loose, so that every time you pedal it falls off -- that’s a maladaptive tension.

    B. If you have a chain that is too tight that you can’t even pedal, that’s a maladaptive tension.

    So how do we deal with that maladaptive tension in biking? We have a rear derailer. A rear derailer is a magical device that changes the tension on that chain, regardless of what gear you are in, so you can go downhill, uphill, or on different types of terrain and always have the optimal tension on that chain, so you are getting the right force out of every pedal. I live in Utah, where there are tons of mountains, where I’ll do 4,000-5,000 feet of elevation in a day. What I find is that regular sort of chain ring and tension system isn’t as optimal in getting me to that sort of climbing that I need to do. So, I’ve been looking at a new type of chain ring that is oval, not round. With an oval chain ring, you can get more torque out of every pedal, due to the physiology of how you pedal and the mechanics of the bike.

    Now the difference with the creative versus the adaptive tension, is that the adaptive tension with the rear derailer is adjusting the tension within a current system. I don’t have to change any of the parts of my bike. Whereas with the creative tension, I’ve got to change physical parts of my bike; it’s a structural change. And also that structural change forces a new practice – as I pedal it is different. Those are three different types of tensions that we as innovators choose to transform a maladaptive tension into either an adaptive or creative tension.

    Now as an entrepreneur, what I found running my own medical device incubator, is that there’s not enough money to be had in starting a company just to be an adaptive tension transformer. To make things 10 to 20 percent better, you can’t raise venture capital, you can’t get people excited about it. It’s really the creative tension that creates the transformation that makes things that are five and 10 times better and those create the opportunities worthy of starting a new company and raising venture financing. As an entrepreneur, what I’m really seeking is how do I transform a maladaptive tension into a creative tension so that I can really do step change.

    Let me give you some examples with Elon Musk. Elon Musk has this Hyperloop – the train that he has designed that will be in California. If you look at trains from a maladaptive perspective, they are currently very maladaptive. I used to live on the east coast and take the train to the northeast corridor. They are always breaking down; they go pretty slow; you can drive faster than the train can go. It’s incredibly expensive to maintain them, so there’s tons of maladaptive tensions in our current train system. So an adaptive approach says: Let’s take the same basic technology and make it go a little bit faster. If you look at the California high-speed rail initiative, those trains will average 80-90 mph versus 60 mph of a regular train. Now I know they have peak speeds of 200 mph, but they don’t represent that they will be going 200 mph; they are going to be going about 30-40 percent faster than a regular train. That’s an adaptive approach. And that adaptive approach costs 70 billion dollars. Elon Musk has an approach where the trains will be averaging 700 mph, so 10x faster, and it would cost seven billion dollars or 90 percent less. So that’s a creative tension approach. I’m not going to use the existing structures and practices to make them go a little bit faster and make them a little more efficient. I’m going to create entirely new structures and practices that are 10x better and cost 90 percent less. When you look at smartphones, telecommunication and a look at a lot of these new technologies, what they are doing is offering that type of a value proposition. I’m going to be 10x better and 90 percent less.

    **Catalyze:** In our health system we have tons of tension and there are probably lots of different areas. I’m curious to hear your thoughts on where you think the biggest opportunities are in healthcare, in terms of where the tension is and then potentially what you see as an example in healthcare of maladaptive versus adaptive and creative tension.

    **Dr. Wasden:** The most powerful tension in every organization, including healthcare, is the tension between running the business of today and creating the change of tomorrow.

    The reality of running the business of today is that all the existing structures—the reimbursement structures, the educational structures, the technology structures—all those structures that support the business of today are in fact barriers to create the business of tomorrow.

    Our problem within healthcare is that the structures are much more rigid in healthcare than they are in other industries. You didn’t have to get FDA approval to go from paper media to digital media. You didn’t have to get FDA approval to go from a flip phone to a smartphone. It didn’t require a regulatory approval of the device; it didn’t require a regulatory approval for the payment.

    Generally, you didn’t have a separation between those who paid and those who received the benefit—the buyer and the beneficiary tended to be the same. With healthcare, Peter Drucker said, it’s the most the most complicated of all industries in the world to try to manage and improve. It’s not going to be easy. It’s also shocking to me that you have an organization like Google that tried to go after Google Health, did three different innovations, failed, then ran away and said we will never touch healthcare again. But now what are they doing with Alphabet? Over half of all their initiatives are healthcare-oriented.

    I don’t want to be critical of Google’s efforts just because we don’t know what the business model is yet. When Google launched as a product itself, its business model was merely to copy the software licensing and business model, and they only went to the ad model when the portals of the day rejected Google selling its product under the old business model. The tension or failure of what they had caused a new business model which was successful. I’m all for Google coming up with lots of ways to create value and then figuring out what the business model is later on in the process.

    I do think what Google is doing is interesting because they are looking at areas of high cost where they can come up with something that could radically change the way things are being done, and they are doing that in ways that are not necessarily saying that we are going to go after this big market and try to get every doctor to change. But they are saying, let’s create these small experiments. Look what they did with the cars. They didn’t go to the big automobile manufacturers and say, “Hey, we’ve got this great idea for new technologies for cars and you’ll be able to automate it and whatnot.” They just did it. You see the same sort of thing playing out in healthcare where they are just going to do it. And then they’ll try to get some partners. You’ve seen that they’ve already started to get some pharma partners with their glucose monitoring contact lens, but they didn’t try to get them initially. They developed the technology, figured out if it worked and then started to find partners where they could find partners.

    The reality is that there are some healthcare organizations that are interested in being disruptive. The key is to find those partners who are really willing to push the envelope to do things differently, because the vast majority of the healthcare profession does not want to innovate.

    I’ve seen some statistics that suggest over 50 percent of doctors are going to retire within 10 years. That 50 percent of doctors, they don’t want to do anything different for the next 10 years. They just want to get to the finish line. They don’t care about mobile health and digital health records. They don’t care about genomics or anything else. It will take decades to train the current young cohorts going through medical school, so they can be the next vanguard of innovation in healthcare. Most innovations take about a decade to make a significant impact in the market. In healthcare, it’s two to three times long as other industries try to achieve radical change. Denmark implemented electronic health records in 1973. The United States passed laws to start implementing electronic health records in 2003 – 30 years later. That’s the pace that we are on in healthcare.

    **Catalyze:** Are there ways that you see to operate as an innovator to constantly kind of learn in healthcare despite that relatively strict regulatory structure of the industry?

    **Dr. Wasden:** The most important thing that I’ve learned in innovating with doctors is that doctors need to see evidence that something works. You look at the 99 percent of all the healthcare-related apps out there, there’s no evidence that any of these things work. Most apps are failures; most apps have no evidence that they’ll work, so I think we need to focus more on the design side. We need to have a human centered design. By the way, medtech companies don’t do, and pharma companies don’t do.

    These new technologies really have an opportunity to differentiate themselves versus the traditional players that really don’t apply this sort of approach to innovation.

    If you ask a medtech or pharma company: Who is your customer? It’s not the consumer, it’s a doctor. But what’s happening with healthcare is that the consumer is becoming the customer. We now have a new opportunity in this new paradigm of actually designing things that are consumer, customer-oriented, rather than physician-oriented. That’s one thing to focus on. I know you are a doctor and so I try not to offend every doctor that I meet, but most doctors have no clue how consumers think and act. They don’t think about patients as consumers. Because of that, they don’t really respect what the consumer can do, the consumers opinion. There’s too much paternalism within medicine. We are starting to see now this transformation where we are starting to get away from the paternalism. We are enabling patients now to control their healthcare more effectively. Physicians are beginning to adapt to and accept this.

    My dad is a great example. My dad has some back pain. He did his own diagnosis with Google. Then he went to the doctor and said, “I’ve done my research and I’ve identified that I have this problem with my back. I’ve looked at the treatment options. I’ve chosen this option and I need you as a doctor to validate my diagnosis, and I need you to confirm my treatment options, and then we need to move forward."

    The doctor does his work and validates my dad’s diagnosis; he also validates that those treatment options are truly the options, but he then cautions my dad and says, “I’ve done the option that you’ve chosen several times before and I’ve had a less than 50 percent success rate and so I don’t recommend you do that.”

    My dad says, “I know that you are not good at this procedure, but I’ve found a doctor at the University of Utah Medical Center that has an 80 percent success rate and so I’d like you to refer me to him.” So my dad was referred to him; he had the procedure and it was completely successful. My dad walked out of the hospital the next day and the problem was solved. Now I’m not saying everyone is as smart as my dad. And, I’m not saying that’s the way everyone will be treated, but that’s a world that could not have existed 10 years ago. This is the world that we’re all moving around healthcare. Increasingly, we’ve got to have our healthcare system adapt to people becoming more engaged in their healthcare and being able to do self-diagnosis and self-treatment.

    **Catalyze:** You work with the medical students at the University of Utah, right?

    **Dr. Wasden:** Correct.

    **Catalyze:** Do you see the shift in the medical students and residents compared to some of the older physicians that are within five to 10 years of retirement?

    **Dr. Wasden:** I see more of that. You also have another phenomenon that might help that. More of these younger doctors, well half of them are women. So you have a different perspective from a women’s versus a man’s all the time. The other thing is that most of them are employed. Although there are still production expectations and whatnot, I think they are a little bit more open to new ideas, more so than if they had to put out their own shingle and live by whatever they could kill.

    **Catalyze:** The majority of my younger physicians are really interested in sensors and patient recorded data and those things. I’m probably skewed toward knowing more younger physicians, but that group certainly seems a lot more interested in those things. You read about cloud computing and the cost of infrastructure and all these different pieces as being enablers of software eating the world, in the words of Marc Andreessen.  You actually mentioned it as a potential risk, where it is so easy to create something and so easy to create a market with the technology and so easy to miss some of the other essential steps like talking to 100 users and really trying to understand the problem that you are trying to solve, because it makes it so much cheaper, faster, easier to jump right into actually building a solution as opposed to actually understanding the problem and what the solution should be. Could you speak a bit more to that point and some of the risk associated with jumping right in, because technologically you can today.

    **Dr. Wasden:** Let me give you a personal experience I had in college. Thirty years ago I got an undergraduate degree in accounting. This was before there were computers and spreadsheets like that and the capstone course is a course where you had to, on a big green tablet spreadsheet, do all the financial transactions and analysis for a company. Anytime you make a mistake on paper and pencil, you have to erase it and the professor gave you one green sheet of paper and that was it. So every time that we made an assumption, we would think really hard about that, not on the green piece of paper, but on another piece of paper and make sure we had the right answer before we put it on the big green piece of paper.

    A few years after that, we had Lotus 123 and then Excel. What happened was that all of the cost of being wrong, that is making a mistake on the big green pad and erasing it goes away.  Because we have these electronic spreadsheets now and we can make mistakes all the time. What happens is that people started gravitating toward using these huge complex financial models where they didn’t even think through the assumptions very well, because the cost of changing things was so low that they didn’t need to invest thinking about it upfront.

    As an investment banker at JP Morgan, I would have all these junior associates working for me, they would spend hours and hours on mindless financial analysis, making all sorts of data assumptions, because again the incremental costs of making a mistake was so small that they’d just start building the model. I would call them back and say that I would not allow them to use Excel until after they’ve created a prototype of the financial model on a piece of paper with a pencil, and you’ve thought through all the critical assumptions that you want to do, all the sensitivity analysis that you want to do, and once you’ve got it as a mental model and a paper model and then we can talk about it and go to the spreadsheet and start to work on it. They just wasted too much time on senseless, mindless stuff, because they hadn’t thought through the real problem, what are the variables that will make a difference in our analysis, what are we trying to get through in the end point?

    The cost of development is 90 percent less than they were five to 10 years ago. People rush to building a tool, building a solution before they ever really think about what should that solution be?

    **Catalyze:** I know that we’ve talked in the past about wearables. We’ve talked about patient-recorded data. I think the last time I saw you, you were wearing at least a couple of bracelets, tracking things like your activity. Where do you think we are in terms of the state of innovation around these sensors based technologies compared to two years ago or five years ago?

    **Dr. Wasden:** Five years ago, you end up having most people who thought this was a complete waste of time. No one thought that FitBit would become a billion dollar plus company. The early versions of the FitBit product were very unreliable. I went through five in one year, because it kept breaking; it would fall apart. But FitBit was incredibly generous. Every time mine broke, I notified them and they’d send me a new one for free. Since it only cost them $5.00 to make and I’d paid them $100 already, I kind of pre-paid for 20 of these things. They helped perpetuate it; their apps got better and more people started to see the use cases of gathering data.

    Then, I don’t think we’ve gone far enough with this, but increasingly we’ve seen the Mayo Clinic and others start to indicate that activity is the most effective therapy for any medical condition that you have. Period. Doctors need to start prescribing activity just like they would prescribe a drug and now we are increasingly getting to more nuanced activity where we are thinking about what is the duration. With my Apple Watch now, it makes sure I know that I need to do this activity for at least 30 minutes a day. We’re getting more to the level of activity and the intensity of it, so  does it need to be interval training? Does it need to be just walking at a moderate pace? Does it need to be aerobic – things like that?

    The problem is that the medical field itself has no clue how to answer any of these questions. If I go to my primary care doctor and say, “How much activity should I have on a daily basis? What type of activity should I have? What level of intensity should I have in my activity? How will that impact my other health-related problems?” They don’t know. They have no idea. Activity is a new vital sign. They were never trained on the activity by their medical school and so they don’t know how to interpret it. We have a long ways to go in regard to educating the field of medicine. Activity is just one measure of a wearable, because if you look at almost every measurable wearable we have, these are all new measures that no doctor has ever been trained on.

    Take heart rate for example. We are developing the ability to monitor continuous heart rate. Show me a doctor out of medical school that was trained on how to interpret the continuous heart rate data of a patient. What about continuous temperature measurements? The medical profession doesn’t know how to deal with all this new information and data that we are collecting and therefore it is the consumer and these digital health companies that are creating the need for the medical profession to do something with it.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/texpi0li3m" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="300"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** It seems like that’s a massive opportunity for the private sector to develop evidence to define those reference ranges. Physicians need that evidence. I think evidence related to data is largely like clinical decision support for that data.

    **Dr. Wasden:** If you look at the truth of wearables, truth goes through three phases. It’s ridiculed, then violently opposed, and finally enthusiastically endorsed.

    When all these wearables and the data that we were collecting was first coming out it was being ridiculed. “Who cares about steps?” “We’ve had pedometers for decades and they didn’t make a difference.” “Patients can’t do this; we can’t trust the patient. They are going to put that blood pressure cuff on their dog.”

    Then it became violently opposed. “This is actually malpractice. It’s not really going to create better healthcare. We are deceiving patients by having them buy these devices and wasting their money on that because it is not going to make them healthier.”

    And now, we are seeing that most employers, most physicians that think that actually a patient gathering data is not a bad idea and there’s certain elements such as their weight, blood pressure, diet, sleep and it would be great if they would collect those things.

    What we see now from the research is that patients that collect their own vital signs are more engaged in their health than patients who don’t, and because they are more engaged in their health they are more likely to do healthy things that promote health and wellness. Now we have this accepted conventional wisdom, but it wasn’t that way five years ago. Now the challenge is being smart enough to know what to do with it. It’s not easy to answer those questions.

    I have my Apple Watch here. I like it; it’s nice. There are some decent use cases for it, but to be honest, it’s not like my iPhone. I still don’t know the compelling use case that I really need to have it for and maybe there will never be one. Or maybe we’ll eventually figure it out, but we’re not there yet.

    **Catalyze:** Apple Watch comparison is a great one. I had one on order but canceled it, because I got to the same point where I couldn’t figure out what I would use it for.

    **Dr. Wasden:** There were lots of compromises that Apple made that are hurting it, so I just read that a guy got rid of his Apple Watch to get a GPS, heart rate monitor running watch because it had all the things in it that he needed and he didn’t need to carry his phone with him. So I think it is still that we are trying to figure out what we need to sense, what devices we need to have, what are the use cases we need to have. Do we need to have different watches for everything that we do? Hopefully not.

    **Catalyze:** I want to thank you a lot for your time. You have a lot of great insights.

    **Dr. Wasden:** Alright, thanks!
