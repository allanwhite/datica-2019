:lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
  an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
  standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
  (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance validation.
:body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is an
  organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
  created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

  [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
  HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several other
  compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC, COBIT,
  NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system infrastructure
  roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely create, access,
  store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why does HITRUST matter?\nAs
  healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving technologies to store and transmit
  data, cybersecurity and compliance have become a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted,
  matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth of federal, state and third party security
  mandates has become a feat that can quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf
  that isn’t enough, getting through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve
  compliance are only half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must
  also prove their compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In
  fact, many large hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business
  associates and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted
  assessment, the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and
  report on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts
  and renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
  and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What is
  the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into nineteen
  different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific controls
  within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

  Levels\nIn addition to the above domains, HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty
  five specific controls. For each of those controls, three distinct implementation
  levels exist. Each implementation level builds on the one before it, with level
  three having the most stringent set of requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in
  the CSF are determined for each organization based on their risk profile, accounting
  for aspects like the size of an organization and the number of stored health records.
  \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment
  is information gathering on the entity being assessed. This information is used
  to gauge the organization, system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment
  to determine the risk and scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states
  that controls should be implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST
  is prescriptive in dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n###
  3 Degrees of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of
  assessment that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each
  level builds on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued
  CSF Self Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved
  CSF Assessor has verified the information gathered by the organization completing
  the assessment with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified
  means the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
  builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
  entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
  How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity of
  the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
  How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
  including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
  experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
  are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
  that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
  easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
  extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
  Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
  by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
  a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud infrastructure
  you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."

    ### **Direct costs of becoming HITRUST CSF certified**

    A validated HITRUST Assessment that results in a HITRUST CSF Certification is a more complete, certified version of a HIPAA audit. It was created by large healthcare enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance programs. A standard web app is used to enter information and those entries are validated by a HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization, reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you _hopefully_ get HITRUST certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees to HITRUST and to your auditor, or approved assessor. The direct cost, at the low end, is about $40,000-$60,000 but costs can be much higher for larger organizations.

    ### **Indirect costs **of becoming HITRUST CSF certified****

    As Steve Jobs said, "the most precious resource we have is time" and indirect costs are harder to quantify. In regard to the Datica HITRUST assessment, we estimate the total time spent for all employees and have come to an estimate of 200 hours. Also necessary to consider is the time spent between each audit to address issues and solidify compliance and infosec programs. Though not captured for our HITRUST assessment, this contributes to the overall cost of compliance.

    ### **Total costs **of becoming HITRUST CSF certified****

    Conservatively estimating the cost of an hour of work to be $100/hour, a rough calculation can be tallied. With the cost of salaries, benefits and lost opportunities from work not performed simultaneously (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc) a partial loss must be considered. Based on those numbers, the total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is appraised $60,000 - $80,000. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For us, HITRUST Certification was a no brainer because audits are part of our value proposition to customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large deals. It's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews, sort of like miniature audits. These also cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.

    If you're not a Datica customer and still want to learn why this is so valuable, or you just have questions about what it takes to complete a HITRUST assessment, please don't hesitate to reach out directly or [tweet us][1] as our team of experts wants to be your trusted resource.

  :post: |
    Major organizations in healthcare, currently [United Healthcare](http://www.uhc.com/), [HCSC](http://www.hcsc.com/), [Highmark](https://www.highmark.com/hmk2/index.shtml), [Anthem](https://www.anthem.com/health-insurance/home/overview), and [Humana](https://www.humana.com/) will require HITRUST CSF Certification in all business associate and partner agreements. Those requirements apply to both new and existing contracts. In addition, ten pediatric hospitals are strongly encouraging all of their vendors to become HITRUST CSF Certified. This is a major shift that was done in an effort to reduce the exceptional redundancy and flawed-fraught current process of doing one-off reviews for every vendor.

    Many may be asking themselves what HITRUST is and what this means exactly, and as [HIPAA compliance](/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer) experts, we’re here to answer your questions since we have achieved HITRUST CSF Certification. And as [Dr. Good](/about/travis) says:

    > If I’m being honest, I’d tell you that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly hard. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Catalyze Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected. I’ve experienced HIPAA from multiple angles - as a technical auditor, as a mobile app vendor, as a clinician, and as a compliant platform vendor - but I learned more about compliance from this HITRUST experience than anything I’ve done before. But, that’s all the more reason to be excited about this announcement! HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology bring great value to our customers. I’m ecstatic because our HITRUST CSF Certification will help our customers prove their applications and data are secure. It’s more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits.

    ### 3 HITRUST Facts to Get You Started

    - HITRUST, or the Health Information Trust Alliance, is actually not a framework at all, but the organization that created and maintains the Common Security Framework, or CSF.
    - The CSF, currently in version 7, is a certifiable framework that brings together, or harmonizes, several other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, PCI, ISO, and NIST. By “harmonize” the CSF maps all of those standards together, with the CSF as the central mapping key.
    - According to its website, HITRUST, and its corresponding CSF, “was born out of the belief that information security should be a core pillar of, rather than an obstacle to, the broad adoption of health information systems and exchanges.” Security and compliance are a key part of the success of health technology; they cannot be ignored or treated as an afterthought. Without a standardized framework, process, and certifying body, HIPAA is often an obstacle for healthcare technology. HITRUST is an attempt to help vendors better prove their security and to help covered entities streamline security and compliance reviews of vendors. In that attempt, HITRUST is succeeding.

  :summary: HITRUST is an industry-driven organization with a mission to create a
    standardized and certifiable security and compliance framework for healthcare.
  :blog_lead: |-
    ## HITRUST: A Primer

    HITRUST is an industry-driven organization with a mission to create a standardized and certifiable security and compliance framework for the healthcare industry. It was founded by and is still governed by representatives from covered entities included Unitedhealthcare, Anthem, and Highmark. The framework created by HITRUST, called the Common Security Framework (CSF), is an evolving framework now on version 8.0.

    The mission of HITRUST is to standardize the compliance framework and certification process for healthcare but also to streamline the the process of third party assurance, which basically means making it less resource intensive for both covered entities (payor, providers, clearinghouses) and business associates (BAs) as covered entities assess the risk of data security and compliance in working with third parties (BAs).
  :post: "## Victim of its own success\n\nFast forward to today—HITRUST is well accepted
    in the healthcare industry and is increasingly required by covered entities (CEs)
    for all partners and business associates. These trends are driving demand for
    HITRUST amongst business associates and, in turn, HITRUST is now seeking more
    input and feedback from the business associate community. CEs are looking to engage
    with more BAs and to leverage the HITRUST CSF as the tool to for reducing liability.
    Ultimately the need to engage with business associates is a natural result of
    the success of HITRUST in the industry and amongst CEs.\n\nBecause of this need
    to engage with business associates, HITRUST decided to form a Business Associate
    council in early 2016 to, in HITRUST's words: \n\n> ….to ensure healthcare industry
    business associates and other key vendors are able to influence and directly engage
    with HITRUST, healthcare organizations relating to the HITRUST 3rd Party Assurance
    program, and other programs impacting business associates.\n\nHITRUST called for
    volunteers to participate in providing a voice for BAs is shaping HITRUST:\n\n>
    Through interaction with the BA Council, HITRUST will work to ensure that the
    Third Party Assurance and other programs are considering and accommodating business
    associate and vendor perspectives and objectives.\n\nHITRUST [selected][1] a group
    of 17 founding members representing a diverse swath of the BA landscape from [Epic][2]
    to [Dropbox][3] to [Salesforce][4] to Datica; we're honored to be chosen and to
    lend a voice for BAs in helping to influence HITRUST initiatives and programs.\n\n##
    Why does it matter?\n\nHITRUST was founded by a group of very large CEs, all of
    which are payors. Covered entities are [fundamentally different][5] from business
    associates. Covered entities leverage business associates for services; put another
    way, covered entities are customers for business associates. There are significant
    differences around liability as CEs are liable for breaches, both for themselves
    as well as from their BAs. As such, CEs need a compliance framework they can use
    internally and this was the initial impetus for HITRUST. CEs also need a way to
    manage the risk of working with 3rd party BAs while BAs need a way to provide
    evidence to CEs that the risk in working with BAs is mitigated. The HITRUST CSF
    is emerging as the tool of choice for these use cases.\n\nIt is a 2-sides transaction
    when it comes to CEs, BAs, and third party assurance. This is a change from the
    original HITRUST use case. BAs need a compliance framework to assure not only
    their own, internal auditors and compliance groups but also the compliance groups
    at their CE customers. And there are a lot more BAs than CEs. HITRUST estimates
    that the 5 major payors mandating HITRUST for BAs impacts close to 7,500 BAs!
    That's an astounding number.\n\nIn order to meet this overwhelming demand and
    the unique needs of this new cohort, HITRUST created the Business Associate Council.
    The council is already working on several initiatives. One initiative, which started
    before the Business Associate Council but is in line with BA needs, is the concept
    of compliance inheritance within the CSF. We're confident more enhancements will
    be created based on the work of the Business Associate Council and that these
    enhancements will add value to BAs that decide to leverage the CSF as their compliance
    framework.\n\n[1]: https://hitrustalliance.net/first-business-associate-council-healthcare-industry-help-drive-efficiencies-effectiveness-third-party-assurance/\n[2]:

  :post: "To understand where we are today, it's important to know where [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/)
    came from. After HIPAA was passed into law in 1996, the following decade or so
    was a confusing, disorganized morass in which the HIPAA Security Rule did not
    provide prescriptive measures for covered entities (CE) and [business associates
    (BA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
    Basically, these organizations were given the flexibility to implement comprehensive
    information security programs and analyze their own levels of risk — something
    many healthcare organizations had no experience with, so even those who did have
    programs had ones that were significantly less robust than they needed.\n\nIn
    2007, leaders within the healthcare field — including CIOs, security and privacy
    officers from leading healthcare providers, insurers and vendors — came together
    to solve this problem. HITRUST initially developed an information security framework
    with the intentions of creating an industry standard, including control baselines
    so an organization could make their own choice based on their unique needs. Originally
    referred to as the [HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework),
    the CSF was developed specifically for healthcare — designed to be scalable, customizable
    and capable of providing certifiable risk assurances.\n\nToday, the HITRUST CSF
    is the most widely adopted information privacy and security risk management framework
    among healthcare organizations in the United States. In addition, many organizations
    outside of the U.S. have also implemented the HITRUST CSF.\n\nNaturally, there
    are always questions and concerns about paradigm-shifting approaches — especially
    when it concerns information security and privacy. Every day seems to bring more
    risk and news stories about hacks and breaches. So it makes complete sense for
    a group of experts to lead the charge and collaboratively build a security framework
    that can benefit the entire industry. \n\nWith that said, here are a few of the
    issues that I saw being discussed online — and my take on them:\n\n## Misconception
    #1: The HITRUST approach is too expensive — costing excessive money, time and
    resources.\n\nSome people forget how things used to be — when \"doing it yourself\"
    was expensive and time-consuming, usually with poor results. While a company usually
    starts with an inexpensive [HITRUST self-assessment](http://content.datica.com/what-is-a-hitrust-csf-self-assessment),
    that's just the first step. \n\nThe costs of a HITRUST-validated assessment are
    commensurate with a third-party assessment; and if you perform a comprehensive
    assessment of any type, the costs should be roughly equivalent. Although in many
    cases, the overall information privacy and security assessment costs can be substantially
    less because of the assess-once, report-many approach supported by the HITRUST
    CSF Assurance program. The alignment between the HITRUST CSF and CSF Assurance
    programs allows a single CSF Assessment report to support multiple objectives
    (such as a HIPAA risk assessment or an assessment against the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework), and this same report can be accepted by multiple external parties
    (business partners, government agencies, etc.) — reducing the costs associated
    with multiple assessments. \n\nIn addition, a HITRUST CSF assessment will identify
    which controls will be evaluated and provide illustrative assessment procedures,
    which allow for better preparation — and potentially reducing costs. In addition,
    an organization can get a HITRUST CSF Validated report and a SOC 2 report based
    on one assessment, making the costs substantially less than doing two separate
    assessments.\n\nOf course, determining the ultimate value of a HITRUST CSF Assessment
    centers on the peace of mind found after going through the process — and knowing
    that a breach can cost millions of dollars. Also, what are the other options that
    would be comprehensive, relevant and consistent, while offering the needed transparency?
    \ \n\nComparatively, the costs of the HITRUST approach are negligible. It might
    seem reductive to say, but the age-old question must be considered: \"How much
    are you willing to spend for peace of mind?\" Of course, more bottom-line-focused
    professionals simply have to look at the return on investment (ROI) to see the
    true value.\n\n## Misconception #2: It's unnecessarily burdensome to implement
    the HITRUST methodology.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the \"old way\" of establishing
    your own information security program was both undirected and cumbersome, costing
    tremendous amounts of time and money. To be sure, implementing the HITRUST CSF
    at my company took effort. \n\nBut all of us at Datica understand the importance
    of comprehensive risk management, and chose HITRUST to help us train for a higher
    level of information security and create the optimal organizational structure.
    \n\nWhile the assessment required significant time and resources to complete,
    the ability to satisfy multiple assessment and reporting requirements saved us
    both time and money in the long run. (Based on our experience, we also recommend
    designating a team member as the internal subject matter expert.) We truly believe
    it's more than worth the effort.\n\nOne of my esteemed colleagues, Lee Penn, is
    the CFO and Chief Compliance Officer at PDHI —  a SaaS company that develops and
    distributes the ConXus Platform for delivering workplace wellness and population
    health management programs. Lee — also a member of the HITRUST Business Associate
    Council — noted that his company had a similar experience to ours. He said that
    while it was time and resource-intensive — particularly so, as it was the first
    third-party attestation that PDHI had ever sought — they're a better company,
    with a more effective information privacy and security program for having made
    the effort to achieve certification under the HITRUST CSF. It's now part of the
    PDHI culture — and the resources they now save by not having to undergo repetitive
    assessments easily offsets the ongoing costs of maintaining the certification
    — while heightening PDHI's trustworthiness to its clients.\n\nWhile other methodologies
    use a simplistic and non-prescriptive \"red/yellow/green stoplight\" and costly,
    unique questionnaires — which most would agree provided too much wiggle room with
    compliance — HITRUST's more sophisticated scoring model provides better accuracy
    and precision than a checklist approach, and subsequently better assurances about
    the state of an organization's information protection, whether for use internally
    or by a third party. \n\n## Misconception #3: The results and efficacy of the
    HITRUST approach are questionable.\n\nQuite simply, nobody else reaches the level
    of quality assurance for third-party assessments as those conducted by HITRUST
    Assessors. And organizations now have over 50 assessors (a number that continues
    to grow) to choose from, so users can \"shop around\" and take advantage of free
    market dynamics to find one that meets their specific needs. \n\nI was recently
    speaking with Pamela Arora — senior vice president and chief information officer
    at Children's Health in Dallas — who has seen the same benefits from her organization's
    efforts as my own company. She observed that with the threat landscape continuously
    evolving, we must continue work to ensure our security programs protect patient
    and organizational data from end to end, because you're only as strong as your
    weakest link. Protecting data, she noted, is one of their highest priorities;
    therefore, if a partner goes through the third-party certification with HITRUST,
    they're able to be more confident that the organization's security posture is
    not eroded, since they know the partners also meet CSF security requirements.
    \  \n\nPamela recognizes that challenges exist. In some instances, an organization's
    culture may initially be resistant to pursuing certification, but with continued
    encouragement from the industry — and demonstration of the value in CSF certification
    — they're confident that potential resistance will ultimately melt away.\n\nClearly,
    the widespread adoption of the HITRUST CSF — which is used for everything from
    a \"best practices\" reference to the basis for a certifiable information protection
    program — demonstrates that the HITRUST approach works. If that's not enough evidence,
    a recent review by Allied World U.S. stated that [\"organizations that had obtained
    a HITRUST CSF Certification posed lower cyber-related risks than those organizations
    that have not.\"][1]\n\n## Misconception #4: Making HITRUST certification a requirement
    is unfair. \n\nThis complaint really confuses me — and I'm a vendor. There are
    many good reasons why organizations are requiring a HITRUST CSF certification
    of their business associates, and most of them positively benefit the business
    associates. Covered entities have been expanding and enhancing their information
    protection since passage of the HITECH ACT — a trend which has only been exacerbated
    by recent statistics on 3rd party-related breaches. \n\nThe result has been an
    increase in the number of requests for assessments or other forms of assurance
    — which are often different from one covered entity to another, and subsequently
    add cost and complexity to the healthcare system. Fortunately, this trend has
    been recognized by a growing number of covered entities, who have seen resources
    distracted from their own information protection programs to perform and evaluate
    assessments of their vendors and other business associates.\n\nFor organizations
    that have a strong information privacy and security program, undergoing a HITRUST
    CSF assessment is not a difficult process — and those that aren't committed to
    stronger privacy and security were not going to hide from a comprehensive assessment
    regardless. This way, they have a smart option that can be used more broadly across
    the industry. In fact, that's one of the roles of the HITRUST Business Associate
    Council — to ensure that vendors are fully engaging in the process and working
    more broadly with the industry (and even across industries) to ensure the HITRUST
    CSF Assessment reports are accepted. \n\n## The bottom line: Together, we can
    make things better.\n\nBuilding industry consensus on information protection methodologies
    and standards is what the [HITRUST Alliance](https://hitrustalliance.net/) is
    all about. It takes experienced, respected professionals to lead the way for improvements
    in any industry, and healthcare is no different. Professionals from every corner
    of the industry have provided — and continue to provide — their valuable time
    and insight. HITRUST welcomes active participation in its committees and working
    groups, and constructive feedback through its comment process from anyone in the
    field who would like to share their ideas for the betterment of us all. \n\nThe
    truth is that we're all in this together, and our common goal is the common good
    — protecting individually identifiable healthcare information. At every level,
    our industry has to embrace the shift to digital management of healthcare information,
    understand the risks involved in this change, and take appropriate steps to manage
    them. By working together, we can all focus on creating practical, reliable ways
    to improve security and minimize risk. In my view, HITRUST has taken a leading
    role in improving the state of information protection in the healthcare industry
    and is doing so efficiently and effectively.\n\n[1]: https://hitrustalliance.net/content/uploads/2016/02/HITRUST-CSF-AWAC-Cyber-Insurance-PR_final-for-wire.pdf"

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

    and disadvantages of this will help you wield HITRUST successfully.
  :blog_lead: One big reason HITRUST is taken so seriously is how it is composed of
    a long list of other security and risk management frameworks. HITRUST is a superset
    security framework and understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of
    this point goes a long way in understanding how to wield HITRUST successfully.
  :post: "The HITRUST Alliance purposefully took the best parts of past frameworks
    to mold its \"Common Security Framework\" or CSF. The [HITRUST CSF](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)

    negatives of HITRUST CSF certification\n\nThere are positives and negatives to
    thinking about [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) as a superset framework.\n\nFirst,
    the main negative: If you become HITRUST CSF Certified, you are **not** certified
    or compliant with the above list. If you want to be SOC2 certified or PCI compliant,
    you must still conduct those assessments independently with your auditor. If your
    business is such where it's mandatory you provide those defined assurances, it
    means you have other audits to manage and pay for. That can be frustrating.\n\nBut
    there are many positives to HITRUST's superset nature. The biggest is the credibility
    and thoroughness attributed to a certification. Most compliance and security officers
    at covered entities are adopting HITRUST as the best and only required way to
    assess business associates because they know if someone is HITRUST CSF Certified,
    they have gone through a thorough process to prove assurances.\n\nThe other positive
    is the overall reduction in cost for your company to prove security and compliance.
    Again, within the framing that it's not necessarily a hard requirement to show
    PCI compliance, et al, your organization can effectively demonstrate credibility
    within those 14 frameworks in a one-time shot. We've written a case study about
    [our own HITRUST certification costs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/),
    which average somewhere around $20,000-$60,000 depending on scope.\n\nIf you are
    working on a project which requires compliance and are looking into HITRUST, consider
    us a resource. We'd be happy to chat more about the benefits of HITRUST on the
    cloud. \n\n"

  :summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of
    band authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is
    responding.
  :blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
    kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
    attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from
    White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent
    one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
    more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
    ourselves.
  :post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
    and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
    organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization
    is immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the
    widespread issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of
    Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update,
    specifically [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html),
    includes important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods
    versus a single source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
    is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
    and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
    makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity
    proofing\n \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates
    out identity authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and
    authentication proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have
    the proper credentials to access a file, server, or other data containing device
    or software,” explained Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole
    question is: How do we prove John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance
    is important to Datica customers who live and breathe in an environment awash
    with protected health information. More and more the healthcare industry is affected
    by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
    that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
    ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high
    price on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n
    \nThis clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because
    that will change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an
    organization, a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the
    victim’s accounts.\n \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n
    \nThe engineering team is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to
    disallow email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to
    the problem of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
    risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected
    health information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach
    to helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
    chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why
    Datica developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    platform initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become
    HITRUST CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security
    and compliance a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica
    at hello@datica.com to arrange a quick chat about your needs and to learn more
    about how the Datica Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

  :summary: HITRUST certification by the HITRUST Alliance enables vendors and covered
    entities to prove HIPAA compliance based on a standardized framework.
  :lead: |-
    > The reason a lot of people do not recognize opportunity is because it usually goes around wearing overalls looking like hard work. – Thomas A. Edisons

    The term “HIPAA compliant” gets thrown around a lot—by vendors, consultants, developers, audits, and others. The problem with the free flowing nature of the term is that “HIPAA compliant” is subjective. The only way to [prove](https://catalyze.io/learn/proving-hipaa-compliance) compliance is to complete—and pass—an external audit, preferably one conducted by a reputable audit firm with HIPAA experience.
  :post: |-
    Because of the subjective nature of HIPAA and variability in audits (as a former info sec auditor I feel qualified in saying that), [covered entities](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-hipaa-privacy-rule) have a hard time assessing compliance and security for external vendors as well as internal projects (think innovation groups and research). Oftentimes the result is a re-invention of the wheel every time a vendor sells to a new covered entity and every time a covered entity assesses the security of a new vendor. It’s incredibly inefficient and ripe with opportunities to miss things; missing things with security and compliance expose covered entities to significant risk. Enter HITRUST, an industry-driven effort to standardize on a common, certifiable framework to benefit both vendors and covered entities.

    ### Introduction to HITRUST

    [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/), or the Health Information Trust Alliance, is actually not a framework at all, but the organization that created and maintains the Common Security Framework, or [CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-csf/). The CSF, currently in version 7, is a certifiable framework that brings together, or harmonizes, several other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, PCI, ISO, and NIST. By “harmonize” the CSF maps all of those standards together, with the CSF as the central mapping key.

    According to its website, HITRUST, and its corresponding CSF, “was born out of the belief that information security should be a core pillar of, rather than an obstacle to, the broad adoption of health information systems and exchanges.” Security and compliance are a key part of the success of health technology; they cannot be ignored or treated as an afterthought. Without a standardized framework, process, and certifying body, HIPAA is often an obstacle for healthcare technology. HITRUST is an attempt to help vendors better prove their security and to help covered entities streamline security and compliance reviews of vendors. In that attempt, HITRUST is succeeding. More and more health systems are asking for HITRUST and vendors that have it are moving more quickly through the process with covered entities.

    (Image credit: [HITRUST CSF Assurance Program](https://hitrustalliance.net/content/uploads/2014/04/BA-1-Understand-the-CSF-and-CSF-Assurance-Program.pdf))


    ### CSF Domains and Controls

    The CSF is divided into 19 different domains. In contrast to HIPAA, the CSF does not create broad buckets like Administrative and Security controls.

    * Information Protection Program
    * Endpoint Protection
    * Portable Media Security
    * Mobile Device Security
    * Wireless Protection
    * Configuration Management
    * Vulnerability Management
    * Network Protection
    * Transmission Protection
    * Password Management
    * Access Control
    * Audit Logging & Monitoring
    * Education, Training & Awareness
    * Third Party Security
    * Incident Management
    * Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
    * Risk Management
    * Physical & Environmental Security
    * Data Protection & Privacy

    In addition to the above domains, HITRUST has 135 specific controls.


    ### CSF Levels of Implementation

    For each of the 135 controls defined by HITRUST, there are 3 distinct implementation levels. Each implementation level builds on the one below - level 2 includes all of level 1 plus additional requirements, level 3 includes all of level 2 plus additional requirements. So technically level 3 is the most stringent set of requirements. Most organizations have varied levels of implementation for different controls and are not just level 1 or 2 or 3 across the board.

    I think this is the area in which there is the most confusion about HITRUST, or at least the area in which we get asked most about our own HITRUST CSF Certification. The start of every HITRUST assessment, regardless of the type of assessment (see Degrees of Assurance below for more on that), is gathering information about the entity being assessed. This information is used to assess the organization, system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment. Conceptually, the risk or scope of the assessment is being determined.

    This step is also written into HIPAA but is not a part of most assessments. HIPAA allows for controls that are reasonable and appropriate. In the words of HHS `An important step in protecting electronic protected health information (EPHI) is to implement reasonable and appropriate administrative safeguards that establish the foundation for a covered entity’s security program.` Most HIPAA assessments are one size fits all because there is no framework to interpret `reasonable` and `appropriate`; in the end, it’s likely a good thing that those aren’t interpreted.

    In determining the implementation level, HITRUST dynamically sets requirements for each organization and each assessment. Like the CSF more broadly, it’s a standardized process for determining implementation level.


    ### CSF Degrees of Assurance

    HITRUST offers 3 different Degrees of Assurance, which are essentially levels of assessment. The Degrees of Assurance align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds on the one below. For reference, Datica has completed a CSF Certified assessment, which is the highest Degree of Assurance.

    The following options exist for Degrees of Assurance, starting with the least cost, effort, time, and rigor.

    1. **Self Assessment.** This is simply an organization completing CSF on its own. It is valuable, typically as an internal tool for the organization, because it’s done again a standardized framework. There are no external parties that verify any aspects of the assessment. It results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self Assessment Report.

    2. **CSF Validated.** This, and the CSF Certified option below, requires a 3rd party CSF Assessor to verify the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment. The CSF Assessor is [approved](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/) by HITRUST. This Degree of Assurance requires an onsite visit by the CSF Assessor. HITRUST reviews the completed and validated assessment and issues a Validated Report as the outcome.

    3. **CSF Certified** Similar to the CSF Validated assessment, the organization undergoing the assessment is granted a HITRUST CSF Certification that is good for two years. The major differences for this Degree of Assurance is that the organization granted HITRUST CSF Certification meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the entries of the organization and the validation of the 3rd party assessor. In the case of Datica, this final step for certification took 3-4 months.


    ### PCI for Healthcare

    There are parallels between HITRUST and PCI. For those that are not familiar, PCI is the compliance framework for the financial and payments processing industry. Achieving PCI compliance is very involved, similar to a Certified HITRUST Assessment. Whereas HIPAA was written and is technically enforced by the federal government (HHS specifically), the CSF was written and is maintained by HITRUST, which is [governed](https://hitrustalliance.net/about-us/board-directors/) by a representative body from the healthcare industry.

    In many ways, HITRUST is an attempt by the healthcare industry to create a standardized, PCI-like certification. In terms of enforcement, the healthcare industry, as opposed to HHS, is meant to enforce HITRUST by requiring Certified Assessments of business associates and subcontractors. There are still gaps in adoption within the healthcare industry, but the tide is clearly turning as more and more entities are expecting vendors to be HITRUST CSF Certified.


    ### HITRUST vs HIPAA

    As mentioned above, HITRUST builds on HIPAA. It takes HIPAA, a non-standardized and non-prescriptive compliance framework, and creates a standardized compliance framework, assessment, and certification process for the healthcare industry. In the process it “harmonizes” HIPAA with other compliance frameworks such as PCI and NIST. HITRUST also adapts requirements for certification to the risks of an organization based on organizational, system, and regulatory factors.

    As opposed to HIPAA, which has defined penalties for security breaches, the enforcement of HITRUST is dependent on the healthcare industry itself, typically covered entities like hospitals and payers, requiring HITRUST CSF Certification of vendors. HITRUST has gained adoption quickly in healthcare and we are seeing it more and more as an expectation for vendors. While not always required as a step in implementing a new technology, HITRUST certainly streamlines the security and compliance step in the implementation process.

    Having been through both HIPAA audits and a Certified CSF Assessment, it is safe to say that HITRUST CSF Certification is a much more rigorous process, with a higher burden of proof put on the organization trying to achieve certification, than a HIPAA audit. Achieving HITRUST CSF Certification requires significantly more time, effort, and resources than a HIPAA audit. Being HITRUST CSF Certified should be seen as a more significant badge for security and compliance than completing a HIPAA audit.
