  :summary: 'The rapidly growing startup is solving one of one of healthcare''s hardest
    problems: finding a way to provide a universal data model for healthcare to help
    physicians improve the standards of care.'
  :lead: Three years ago, Cota, a New York-based digital health company had three
    employees. Now, the company is using the minds of nearly 100 employees to solve
    one of the most difficult problems in healthcare — finding a way to provide a
    universal data model for healthcare to help physicians improve the standards of
    care. Ultimately, the company seeks to make changes not just to fundamentally
    change how clinicians use data and make decisions in healthcare, but to accelerate
    the pace of research in academic networks, and provide real-world evidence to
    pharmaceutical companies developing cancer-fighting treatments. As the company
    works to solve this challenge, it is producing a significant amount of research
    in the field and has been published in 15 peer-reviewed journals and delivered
    presentations at multiple industry conferences.
  :post_top: "Two members of Cota’s founding team, oncologists Andrew Pecora, MD,
    and Stuart Goldberg, MD, have been practicing medicine for more than two decades.
    Both work at the John Theurer Cancer Center in Hackensack, NJ. Ten to fifteen
    years ago, the two doctors saw a need that they first set out to solve for themselves
    in their cancer treatment work, later realizing a business could be formed to
    improve the lives of cancer patients everywhere by using data and technology.\n
    \nOne of the challenges with cancer treatment is its complexity of diseases and
    types of treatments, complicated by no two people being alike. In oncology, a
    doctor must consider a patient’s genetic mutations, hormone responses, as well
    as comorbidities before recommending medical treatment. When multiple factors
    like this come into play, treatment of, say, a 25-year-old female with breast
    cancer can vary widely. However, Pecora and Goldberg considered how treatment
    decisions could fundamentally change by taking all the available clinical factors
    that have prognostic and then classify patients to build a universal model for
    a new way of thinking about cancer treatments. \n\nThey started by building a
    simple database to isolate and track key clinical factors that weren’t all in
    place or easy to find in either paper charts or electronic health record systems.
    From that concept, the two doctors eventually formed the company [Cota](https://www.cotahealthcare.com/)
    in 2011 four to five years ago. Over time, Cota grew into a robust value-based
    care measurement and decision support tool for providers, a research platform
    for academics, and a real-world evidence platform for pharmaceutical companies.
    \n“The doctors realized that this could be more than just a database or a classification
    methodology, but rather the beginning of an entire new way to think about classifying
    patient data and using it that for decision making,” says Cota VP of Marketing
    Matthew Levin. “In addition to it working for individual physicians, it could
    also work throughout the entire spectrum of healthcare, including the provider
    organization as a whole.”"

  :post_bottom: "## Precise timing for precision medicine\n\nConsidering the economic
    impact of cancer treatment, Cota’s introduction to the market could not have come
    at a more opportune time. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/economic-impact-of-cancer.html),
    about 600,920 people are expected to die of cancer in 2017 while the [Agency for
    Healthcare Research and Quality](https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/costs/expriach/)
    is indicating that the per-person costs of cancer are exceeding those of the #1
    killer — heart disease. “We are talking about a healthcare system where costs
    are rising in an unsustainable way,” says Levin.\n\nHealthcare is moving from
    fee-for-service care delivery to one based on value, but according to Levin, no
    way exists to quantify that value. “That’s because there’s no way to determine
    if you are giving the right care to the right patient; at present, there’s no
    method of looking at patients on an apple to apple basis,” Levin says. As the
    medical costs increase, determining the right care will be crucial. Cost expenditures
    rise when an aging population is combined with the complexity of all the new therapies
    that are coming to market. “That is an information problem we are trying to solve,”
    he says.\n\n## Healthcare is hard but solvable\n\nWhen evaluating how to turn
    patient data into useable insight at scale, one quickly realizes the complexity
    of such a challenge. Levin says it’s one part technology, one part medical/clinical
    IQ, one part biology, and one part data science and analysis with a certain strong
    human component added to that. “You just can’t press a button and have a computer
    calculate this automatically; it takes a system to do this with an incredible
    amount of engineering and manpower to accomplish the feat. This is not something
    that two guys in a dorm room can hammer out,” Levin explains.\n\nHealthcare, as
    well as this multi-faceted challenge for treating diseases with such complexity,
    remains a giant problem. Only a couple of companies have tried to tackle it. “IBM
    Watson is a great example. We are very friendly with them, but they are attempting
    to solve the problem by taking a different approach. They’ve applied the most
    powerful artificial intelligence (AI) engines in a different way on the data,”
    explains Levin. “That’s the magnitude of of the problem we are trying to solve.”\n\n##
    Oncology and beyond\n \nIn the beginning, the company co-founders used the full
    name of its database tool — Cancer Outcomes Tracking and Analysis, but later began
    using the acronym (Cota) when they saw that the Cota methodology could be applied
    to more than just cancer outcomes. The company has started with oncology, but
    it definitely has expansion plans. Not all medical areas make sense for the Cota
    methodology. Orthopedics being one example of where many of these problems have
    been solved with bundled payments, but Levin says, “many other areas like cardiology,
    behavioral health and other specialties where a certain level of complexity exists
    do make sense.”"
