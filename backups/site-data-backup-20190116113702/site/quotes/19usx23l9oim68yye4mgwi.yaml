:quote_title: Is health IT really 'digital snake oil?' 8 leaders react to Dr. James
  Madara's speech
:quote_type: press
:quote_body: '"Much of the impact of the HITECH has been felt on the front lines of
  healthcare, between the doctor and the patient. Somewhat ironically, practicing
  physicians have not had a major voice in digital health or EHR development. Many
  of the health IT solutions being sold and implemented are driven from outside the
  care experience. I think this outside disruption has driven the recent pushback
  on health IT and digital health, and the subsequent comments by Dr. Madara."'
