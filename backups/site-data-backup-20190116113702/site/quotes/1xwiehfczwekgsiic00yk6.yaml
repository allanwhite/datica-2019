:quote_title: EHRs & mobile design
:quote_type: team
:quote_body: EHRs in a mobile-first world are only possible by unpacking the functionality
  of the EHR into discrete workflows/functions that can be completed efficiently on
  a smartphone. This isn’t replacing the EHR but is a way to make using an EHR more
  efficient.
