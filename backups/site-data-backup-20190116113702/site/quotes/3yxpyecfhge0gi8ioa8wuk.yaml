:quote_body: Healthcare IT developers leverage the collaboration of AWS and its AWS
  Partner Network (APN) partners like Datica, so the unique compliance needs of the
  industry are addressed and supported. We have been using AWS for five years, been
  working with Datica for three years, and the relationship has allowed us to further
  consolidate, secure, and optimize our infrastructure — giving us a significant edge.
