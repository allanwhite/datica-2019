:quote_body: In large part, Datica’s relationships with digital health vendors have
  revolved around educating them on what it takes to create a viable, HIPAA-compliant
  application that a hospital would buy into. So many startups fail because they don’t
  have the right information, either because they come from outside of the healthcare
  ecosystem or simply because the steps to success are either obscure or esoteric
  in nature, explains Olschesky.
