:quote_title: Startup Catalyze wants to streamline EHR integration with apps
:quote_type: press
:quote_body: 'As Catalyze calls integration a “journey” rather than an application
  provider interface or a static integration engine, Redpoint streamlines and manage
  the process with three sets of tools: “Scripts,” pre-configured integration sets
  for specific EHRs; “connectors” to automate data flow between EHRs and third-party
  apps; and workflows called “bearings” to manage integration projects.'
