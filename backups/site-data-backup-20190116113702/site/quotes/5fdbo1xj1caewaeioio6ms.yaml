:quote_title: David Deas (MLH) on ROI (Short version)
:quote_type: customer
:quote_body: 'We were dying to use the cloud but were really stuck: We knew we wanted
  to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) but there were all these things we couldn''t do
  to make that work, like HIPAA compliant DevOps, HITRUST, and infrastructure security.
  Datica puts us in the situation where we can get back to our core competency because
  they handle everything we need to be able to use AWS.'
