:quote_title: Sirj - InsightRX - On His Vision
:quote_type: customer
:quote_body: We saw a large gap in how precision medicine is practiced today. There
  is a significant need to individualize medicine based on unique patient characteristics
  and models/algorithms built on large amounts of data. We saw an opportunity to bring
  these advanced models and algorithms that previously were only available to highly-specialized
  academic researchers to a wider audience of health care practitioners.
