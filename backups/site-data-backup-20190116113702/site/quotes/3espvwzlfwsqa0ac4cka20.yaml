:quote_type: customer
:quote_body: We are a small team and wanted to develop fast, but do so from a security
  perspective. It’s been wonderful for us to continue to iterate and push out product
  rapidly and securely. We look forward to expanding our partnership and leverage
  interoperability on the whole data integration that will be asked of us in the future.
