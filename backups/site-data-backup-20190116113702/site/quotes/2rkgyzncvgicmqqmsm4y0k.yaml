:quote_body: 'The intentional decision to rename the company was based on its success
  in healthcare and involved both protecting what has become a unique business platform
  and also a way to set vision for the future. "Within three years, our path from
  Catalyze to Datica involved a swift move from early startup to mature and thriving
  company, serving virtually all constituencies in healthcare," explained Datica CEO
  Travis Good, MD. "Obtaining a unique and strong company name that reflects the full
  depth and breadth of current expertise, as well as our vision for the future, prompted
  the ''now versus later'' decision."
