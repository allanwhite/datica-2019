:quote_title: Why EHR Integration is Crucial for Digital Health Innovation
:quote_type: press
:quote_body: 'So what’s an ambitious developer to do? Good says whatever you do, don’t
  wait for the process or the access points to get easier, because there’s a lot more
  to consider: “EHR integration tends to be synonymous with message types, but if
  you’ve completed an integration with an EHR, you realize that it is much more of
  a process. It’s a journey. Message types, integration engines, and web services
  are one step in this process. Combining messages with programmed logic, security,
  and project management are just as essential to getting to the finish line of an
  integration.”'
