:quote_title: David Deas (MLH) on ROI
:quote_type: customer
:quote_body: By removing security concerns as a barrier to using cloud-based systems,
  Datica has opened up a new world of possibilities that we would otherwise be too
  cautious to undertake. Leveraging the ease and expandability of the compliant Datica
  platform running on AWS we have greatly accelerated our Innovation team's capabilities
  which allows us to play out "what if" scenarios without large capital commitments
  or burdensome ROI proofs. Datica's support teams have also freed our developers
  to focus on their core competencies rather than constantly being diverted to DevOps
  roles they were reluctantly forced to fill. All of this has greatly expanded the
  number of projects we can tackle and led to a remarkable transformation in how we
  approach healthcare innovation.
