:guide_text: "What does \"HIPAA Compliant\" really mean? Frequently it is just a marketing
  label that some companies bestow upon themselves and not really an attestation of
  compliance. That's risky.\n\nThis worksheet is meant to illuminate the cloud requirements
  of HIPAA that you need to plan for in your own digital health product. A more comprehensive
  risk assessment, such as the HITRUST CSF Self-Assessment, is also necessary. Use
  this checklist to understand what compliance controls are needed, and assess your
  compliant state at several cloud layers:\n\n- __The Physical Layer__ \n- __The Operating
  System and Application Layers__ \n- __The Administrative Layer__\n\nOnce you've
  completed this checklist you'll have a much better understanding of what it will
  take to be HIPAA compliant in the cloud."

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA Basics\n\n* [Learn the basics of HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/)\n*
    [Whis is HIPAA Important?](http://content.datica.com/why-is-hipaa-important )\n*
    [Is HIPAA Federal or State?](http://content.datica.com/is-hipaa-federal-or-state)\n*

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\n*
    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"
    markdown=\"1\">\n\n### PHI Resources\n\n* [Learn more about PHI](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)\n*
    [4 PHI Marketing Special Cases](https://datica.com/blog/4-phi-marketing-special-cases/)\n*
    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business
    Service Agreements\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right\"

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"
    markdown=\"1\">\n\n### HIPAA Compliance Resources\n\n* [HIPAA Compliance with
    Datica](https://datica.com/compliance/)\n* [Proving HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)\n*
    [HIPAA Auditing and Logging](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/)\n*
    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
