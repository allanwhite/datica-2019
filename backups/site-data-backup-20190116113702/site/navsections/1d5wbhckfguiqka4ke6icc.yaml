  :guide_text: "There’s much to know about both compliance and cloud management and
    that knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education, personnel,
    and money. This guide will help makers of digital health products make informed
    decisions about whether to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in
    the form of the Datica Compliant Kubernetes Service.\n\nThis TCO guide explains
    the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and offers
    a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates for each
    of those considerations. These estimates are based on our extensive experience
    working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers
    (like AWS and Azure).\n\nWhat's inside:\n\n- Understanding compliance in the cloud
    \n- Flying solo on AWS or Azure is primitive\n- The importance of proving compliance
    with HITRUST \n- The total cost of ownership framework and estimates\n- TCO summary"
