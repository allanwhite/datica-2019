    Computing Total Cost of Ownership is an important project for any technology leader, but healthcare integrations pose a particularly challenging problem due to hidden process costs.

    When calculating the decision between building your own integrations versus working with a managed service provider, the 'right' answer is the best fitting solution dependent on organizational needs.

    The Datica guide to healthcare integration total cost of ownership will help give you the knowledge to determine your own TCO calculation. Included in the guide:

    - The integration process
    - People - roles and responsibilities
    - Components of work efforts and effort estimates
    - Summary
