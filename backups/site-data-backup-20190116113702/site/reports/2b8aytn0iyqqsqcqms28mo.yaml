    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.
  :body: "\n## What is the Healthcare Cloud?\nA healthcare cloud is a HIPAA cloud
    hosting service used by healthcare IT departments and digital health technology
    vendors to store, maintain, back up, and share Protected Health Information (PHI).

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
