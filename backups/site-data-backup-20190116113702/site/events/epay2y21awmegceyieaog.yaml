  __Complete Cloud Compliance, 10/10 4:00pm__

  The cloud has moved so fast that even within the past year, technology options are totally different. Micro-services, managed services... the cloud is not what it used to be. How do healthcare companies fully meet compliance assurances in a dynamic cloud world? A new open source framework from Datica called [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://techstarsstartupweekseattle2018.sched.com/?s=Kris+gosser&iframe=no&w=&sidebar=&bg=) gives a path. Author Kris Gosser will break it down for attendees in this free session.
