:summary: The next evolution of the company's licensed Platform grants compliance
  coverage for HITRUST, GxP, GDPR, SOC 2 and HIPAA.
:post: "[Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app \"Datica\"), the leading cloud platform for digital
  health since 2013, today announced its next-generation platform to manage HIPAA
  compliance on top of AWS and Microsoft Azure. The evolved version of the Datica
  Platform extends security and compliance expertise in three critical ways to better
  serve healthcare organizations:\n\n1. The [Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform
  \"Platform\") now uses Kubernetes as its underlying container orchestration, granting
  customers greater technical flexibility. \n2. The move will also allow customers
  to install the Platform on their own AWS or Azure cloud accounts. \n3. Compliance
  coverage is extended to include GxP, GDPR, and SOC 2.\n\nKubernetes is now the fundamental
  technical management layer for the platform. Since 2015, Kubernetes has become the
  industry standard for container management, lending the best tools for workload
  deployment on public clouds.\n\n\"Making Kubernetes the central workhorse for the
  next version of the Datica Platform left no debate,\" said Travis Good, MD, CEO.
  \"Kubernetes helps healthcare teams adopt modern technology while bridging to existing
  architectures. Basing the new Datica Platform on Kubernetes will provide stronger
  support for Windows architectures, better service extensibility, and more self-serve
  tooling,\" Good said.\n\nThe move to Kubernetes opens up the ability for customers
  to deploy a licensed version of the Datica Platform on top of their own AWS or Azure
  cloud accounts. Previously customers deployed their workloads onto Datica's hosted
  cloud. Now, the new Kubernetes-enabled Platform allows customers to gain the same
  security and compliance assurances, but in their own cloud accounts. There, they
  can retain maximum flexibility and control.\n\n[Compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance
  \"Compliance\") postures have also been strengthened. The new platform version extends
  support beyond HIPAA and HITRUST. To date, Datica has obtained three HITRUST CSF
  Certifications while its hosted customers have passed more than 1,000 audits and
  risk assessments while on the platform. The new platform will also be GxP and GDPR
  compliant, making it a strong option for Life Science technology teams, or healthcare
  teams who do business in Europe.\n\nAvailable April 2018, the new Kubernetes-enabled
  platform offers a license starting at $40,000 per year. Contact Datica at datica.com
  or visit HIMSS18 booth #5077 to obtain more details for your organization.\n\n####
