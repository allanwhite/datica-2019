:summary: Catalyze Selects Casey Bryson as Chief Strategy Officer
:post: "### Healthcare IT firm strengthens resources with latest hire.\n\nMadison,
  WI - (January 14, 2015)  Catalyze, Inc., today announced its newest executive team
  member. Casey Bryson steps into the Chief Strategy Officer position and will drive
  customer success. In his new role, Bryson will be reporting to CEO/Co-founder Travis
  Good, MD and President/Co-founder Mohan Balachandran.\n\nBryson will have oversight
  of Catalyze business relationships that are rooted in solving complex problems through
  collaboration and integration. “In efforts to align the wants and needs of hospital/provider
  systems with the core capabilities and competencies of Catalyze, my role will require
  relationship building with payers and other large and niche healthcare IT vendors
  in the community,” said Bryson. “Likewise, I’ll also work closely with the company’s
  sales, marketing and engineering to ensure alignment across all internal teams.”\n\nDue
  to the company’s compliant hosting and integration solutions, Catalyze is in a unique
  position within the industry. “We have the ability to speak to different sectors
  of the healthcare industry,” said Catalyze President and Co-founder Mohan Balachandran.
  “With such deep domain experience in working with EHR customers, Casey brings a
  high level of industry knowledge, and also shares a vision of expanding the company
  through strategic business relationships.”  \n\nBryson joined Catalyze earlier this
  month from Epic Hosting where he coordinated customer network and Epic environment
  deployments, internal technical projects, legal agreements and vendor relationships.
  Prior to his work with Epic Hosting, Bryson spent more than 10 years with Epic leading
  the charge to drive overall and long-term customer success. In that role he scoped
  projects for Meaningful Use, ICD-10, population health and patient engagement and
  patient confidentiality.\n\nCatalyze VP of Sales, Kevin Lindbergh, said, “Such experience
  helps Bryson understand how to help customers make their business models function;
  that’s how Catalyze succeeds, because we sell the ability for our customers to get
  things done and go-to-market quickly.”\n"
