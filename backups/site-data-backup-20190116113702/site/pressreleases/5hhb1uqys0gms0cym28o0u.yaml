:summary: Catalyze and HOSTING Partner to Support Rapidly Expanding Healthcare IT
  Market
:post: "### Two industry leaders conflate cloud offerings to provide clients with
  broader service delivery options.\r\n\r\nCatalyze, healthcare’s leading HITRUST
  CSF Certified Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and integration firm, today announced
  a partnership with HOSTING, the leading provider of managed cloud services. This
  partnership will offer 24x7 managed hosting services to the growing and maturing
  clients of Catalyze. Official details about the partnership will be announced at
  the HOSTING Customer Summit in Denver, April 13-15.\r\n\r\n“We are proud to partner
  with HOSTING and leverage its Unified Cloud approach. Both firms specialize in delivering
  an amazing user experience, regardless of which clouds a customer chooses to run
  its application on,” said Catalyze Chief Strategy Officer Casey Bryson. “The relationship
  gives us the ability to work with a single support partner across multiple cloud
  service providers.”\r\n\r\n“Catalyze is a leading innovator in healthcare IT, a
  cornerstone industry for the compliance capabilities at HOSTING,” said Andrew Schroepfer,
  chief strategy officer at HOSTING. “We are excited to bring our best-in-class support
  to the great customers and prospects at Catalyze in the short-term and to expand
  the innovations on securing Docker/containers running on the best cloud platforms
  in the years to come.”\r\n\r\nCatalyze and HOSTING share a similar customer demographic
  in the healthcare IT landscape. Consequently, this trusted partnership allows each
  company to focus on its core competency, leveraging the other for its specific expertise.\r\n\r\n“Trusted
  partnerships allow each company to focus on what they do best, creating an additional
  outlet for both of us,” explained Bryson. “At Catalyze, for example, integrating
  vendor applications with a health systems’ EHRs is an area of expertise and HOSTING
  has been a great reference for us when their existing clients are looking for an
  integration partner to solve sales roadblocks, increase staff bandwidth, or seek
  a fixed cost solution from one project to the next.”\r\n\r\nCatalyze has played
  an ongoing role in the 2016 coast-to-coast HOSTING event series named MILESTONE.
  In February, Catalyze CEO and co-founder Travis Good, MD presented a keynote address,
  Excitement in Healthcare Regulation, for the kick off event in Las Vegas. Today,
  Bryson will present on how Redpoint™, Catalyze’s end-to-end integration solution,
  aligns with the event theme “Center of the (Cloud) Universe.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the
  HOSTING Annual Customer Summit event in Denver, two more MILESTONE events are scheduled
  for the remainder of the series:\r\n\r\n* July 27-29 - HOSTINGpartnerSUMMIT.com
  - 2nd Annual HOSTING Partner Event\r\n* September - HOSTING Pre-Holiday PCI - Compliance
  Party in Boston and NYC\r\n\r\n#### About Catalyze, Inc.\r\n\r\nCatalyze provides
