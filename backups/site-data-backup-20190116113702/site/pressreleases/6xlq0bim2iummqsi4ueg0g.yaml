:post: "\nMadison, WI, and Seattle, WA \n\nDatica™ announced today that they have
  joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a silver member. Datica has
  always been a huge proponent of the open source community, with more than 500 stars
  on the company’s open source policies, and joining the CNCF demonstrates its commitment
  to contributing to the Kubernetes® ecosystem. \n\nDatica recently [migrated it’s
  security and compliance platform to Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/),
  a CNCF project, to offer a complete cloud-native solution for regulated industries
  such as healthcare.  Datica enables organizations to manage the compliant state
  of their entire enterprises in one actionable view — across multiple clouds and
  within multiple industries.  In addition to being cross-cloud compatible and open
  source, the CNCF Kubernetes community and project have grown at a tremendous pace.
  In fact, the [CNCF announced Datica as one of it’s 19 newest members](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-reaches-236-members-including-54-end-users-300671019.html)
  this week, bringing the membership level to 236 companies. What really makes Kubernetes
  a viable option is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons
  that surround it.\n\n“The intent of open source is to provide community-vetted projects
  for the benefit of others, who then freely build upon them to solve other complex
  and pressing problems,” explains Travis Good, MD, CEO and chief privacy officer.
  “Datica is a big believer of the value and spirit of open source and, with our open
  source policies, has already taken the concept beyond bits and bytes to words and
  legalese that can often bog down a digital health enterprise hoping to bring swift
  change to the marketplace.” Good continues, “We’re extending that commitment to
  the open source community by joining the CNCF to collaborate with other Kubernetes
  developers who are trying to build secure and compliant products.”\n\n“We’re thrilled
  to have Datica as one of our newest silver members,” says Dan Kohn, executive director
  of the [CNCF](http://www.cncf.io/). “Other members of the cloud native ecosystem
  who are also developing products for highly-regulated industries such as healthcare
  will benefit from resources and contributions from Datica.”  \n\n### About Datica\n\nDatica
  helps highly regulated industries manage sensitive information in the cloud. The
  Datica Platform complies with HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP and more by providing a
  secure, compliant Kubernetes managed service that integrates with additional cloud
