  ### Two health technology summits tap Catalyze, Inc. for presentations on integration and innovation.

  Madison, WI (PRWEB) June 09, 2015

  [Catalyze, Inc.](https://catalyze.io), a technology company that spurs healthcare innovation with its HIPAA compliant infrastructure services, today announced upcoming presentations for two June health technology conferences in San Francisco, California.

  On June 17, non-profit [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/), which brings startup clinicians, data scientists, developers and designers together to build tools and products that transform the way personal, digital data can be used in healthcare, will host a summit meetup at the [Fort Mason Fire House](http://www.fortmason.org/venuerental/firehouse) on the San Francisco waterfront. Catalyze CEO and co-founder Travis Good, MD, along with Catalyzes’ Chief Data Officer Mark Olschesky, will present on HL7 integration and what’s being accomplished through the company’s HIPAA compliant platform. Registration starts at 8:00 a.m. and the program goes from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

  Dr. Good will also speak at the [Fourth Annual Digital Health Summer Summit](http://summersummit.digitalhealthsummit.com/2015-agenda/), co-hosted by the Center for Digital Health Innovation at UCSF. The two-day conference begins June 18 at the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco. Dr. Good’s panel, titled “Dealmaking, Piloting and Scaling: Do you have what it takes?” begins at 2:05 p.m. on June 19. Panelists for the event include:

  * Travis Good, M.D., Catalyze, Inc. CEO and co-founder (moderator)
  * Molly Coye, M.D., former chief innovation officer for UCLA Health
  * Adam Odessky, co-founder and CEO of Sense.ly

  The session brings together pivotal players to share their strategic insights on how to sell, pilot and scale successfully within healthcare systems. “As medicine moves from volume to value-based care, more hospital systems are reaching out to external sources,” said Good. “Both entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 companies will have the opportunity in this session to learn the ways to effectively talk with and present their ideas to healthcare providers.”
