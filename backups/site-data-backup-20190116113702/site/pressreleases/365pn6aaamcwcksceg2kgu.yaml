:summary: The platform, created by Datica™ and built for healthcare developers, had
  its cloud-based healthcare solution showcased, and general availability on Microsoft
  Azure was announced.
:post: "SEATTLE AND MADISON, WIS. (PRWEB) MAY 08, 2018\n\nDatica, a Microsoft solution
  provider, was featured at this year’s [Microsoft Build 2018 Developer Conference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build/content
  \"Microsoft Build 2018 Developer Conference\"), May 7-9. Engineers and executives
  leading the way in the cloud heard how Datica’s platform, which is HIPAA, HITRUST,
  GDPR and GxP compliant, works in concert with Microsoft Azure to help break-through
  real-world workflows within clinical settings. During Build 2018, Datica’s compliant
  cloud technology was highlighted for its success in connecting Microsoft 365 Business
  tools with Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The new integration tooling that bridges
  Microsoft Teams with EHRs will work within the bot framework of Teams. An announcement
  of the tooling’s general availability in the Azure Marketplace was also made in
  Seattle during Microsoft Build 2018.\n\nTravis Good, MD, CEO and chief privacy officer
  of Datica, said “Announcing this new tooling on top of our new Kubernetes-based
  platform as being generally available for enterprise customers in Microsoft’s ecosystem
  while simultaneously being featured at Microsoft Build 2018, is a huge honor.”\n\nIn
  the healthcare IT field, Datica’s technology is recognized for its compliance with
  HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as its security-focused approach. Datica engineers made
  [healthcare compliance](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/ \"healthcare compliance\")
  a non-issue for application developers when they built the HITRUST CSF Certified
  platform to assume all liabilities in the cloud associated with HIPAA, [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/
  \"GDPR\"), and GxP. The new integration tooling that works to connect Microsoft
  further with healthcare and yet in a compliant way is good for the healthcare field.\n\n“We
  are pleased to see Datica build technologies that help solve healthcare’s technology
  challenges,” said Kristina Behr, General Manager, Office for Healthcare, Microsoft
  Corp. “By bringing Electronic Health Record data into Microsoft Teams for secure
  collaboration, Datica is meeting the challenging workflow demands of the healthcare
  enterprise.”\n\nFollowing Microsoft Build 2018, customers will also be able to license
  Datica’s platform, putting it on their own Azure account, or for additional security
  and compliance oversight, have it managed within Datica’s Cloud on Azure.\n\nAbout
  Datica \nThe Datica Platform manages all ongoing compliance and security burdens
  found within the exacting standards of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, and GxP. Customers
  can license and deploy cloud-native healthcare applications on their own cloud account,
  or tap Datica’s compliance and security expertise to launch and manage applications
  on Datica’s cloud account, as well as receive integration guidance for connecting
  to electronic health records (EHRs). Datica built the HITRUST CSF Certified Platform
  for those who collect, store, manage and share protected health information (PHI)
  in the cloud. Datica’s customers range from mid-to-late stage startups to Fortune
  100 companies across the healthcare spectrum: solution providers, hospital organizations,
  pharmaceutical giants and nationwide health insurance payers. For more information,
