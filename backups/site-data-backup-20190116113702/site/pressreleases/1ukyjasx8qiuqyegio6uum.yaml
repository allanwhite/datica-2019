:summary: Brian Lindstrom boosts Catalyze’s growing roster of employees with deep
  Epic experience.
:post: "MADISON, WIS. (PRWEB) DECEMBER 14, 2016\n\nCatalyze, healthcare’s go-to source
  for HIPAA compliant HITRUST CSF Certified hosting and integration services, today
  announced the appointment of Brian Lindstrom to the role of Chief Operating Officer.
  In this newly created role, Lindstrom will report to Catalyze CEO Travis Good, MD
  and help operationalize the vision and strategy for the company’s two main product
  lines as it expands within the marketplace.\nBefore joining Catalyze, Lindstrom
  previously held the role of Chief Financial Officer for Influence Health of Birmingham,
  Alabama. Considering his Wisconsin roots, he welcomed a return to “the exciting
  health ecosystem of Madison.” Before Influence Health, Lindstrom spent six years
  as Controller for Epic, playing a key execution role in Epic’s rapid growth story.
  He also helped scale the financial group, as well as operationalized Epic’s international
  business and structured customer contracts during the company’s enormous growth
  phase. At Catalyze, he will martial this experience to help the company navigate
  its own growth trajectory.\n\n“Catalyze has some interesting flagship customers
  right now and what the company is doing with integrations for those customers is
  quite unique,” said Lindstrom, Catalyze COO, who expressed excitement about the
  company’s market-leading cloud platform that offers turnkey, HIPAA compliant hosting
  and data integration for digital health applications. Compliant cloud hosting enables
  Catalyze to extend its reach into new markets, such as pharma and payers, which
  both offer new growth potential for the business. “Catalyze uses managed hosting
  and integrations to solve interoperability problems that others have yet to solve,”
  stated Lindstrom.\n\nFrom the other six former Epic employees who now work for Catalyze,
  the sentiment runs parallel to Lindstrom’s. All have an entrepreneurial spirit that
  flourishes at Catalyze, where the opportunity to build something from the ground
  up, know how it works and then support it, presents itself daily. These employees
  also say that they have taken the underlying Epic culture to always do good, while
  always keeping promises, and have extended that sense of personal honor to how Catalyze
  treats its own customers.\n\n“The industry insight that emanates from this group
  of former Epic employees engenders the type of trusted expertise our customers value,”
  said Catalyze CEO and Chief Privacy Officer Travis Good, MD. “Today, we feel fortunate
  to add Brian Lindstrom’s financial and operational leadership expertise into the
  mix.”\n\nAbout Catalyze, Inc. \n\nCatalyze provides an innovative HIPAA compliant,
  HITRUST CSF Certified platform with a complete set of modules to handle, store and
  transmit PHI securely in the cloud. Scalable, HIPAA compliant and interoperable
  infrastructure is powering the future of healthcare, so Catalyze has built the platform
  upon which an enterprise can hasten healthcare innovation without the need to become
  an overnight expert in compliance. For more information, please visit http://www.catalyze.io."
