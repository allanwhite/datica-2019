:summary: Panel discussion to feature four prominent healthcare industry leaders who
  share ideas on managing risk on the cloud to accelerate innovation.
:post: "\nSeattle, WA - Datica, the leading industry cloud for digital health, today
  announced a panel event at the [Pacific Northwest Enterprise Risk Forum](http://www.enterpriseriskforum.org/)
  in Seattle, WA. The one-day summit, tailored to the needs of audit, finance, and
  risk professionals will be held November 8, 2018, at the Grand Hyatt. Travis Good,
  CEO of Datica, will join a panel titled “Managing Risk on the Cloud as a Way to
  Accelerate Organizational Innovation” from 2:45 pm to 3:45 pm in the Princess II
  Ballroom.\n\nAttendees will hear from four distinguished panelists:\n\n* __Michael
  Parisi__, VP, Assurance Strategy & Community Development, HITRUST\n* __Hector Rodriguez__,
  Worldwide Health Chief Information Security Officer, Microsoft\n* __Steve Suter__,
  President & CEO, Healthcare Management Administrators (HMA)\n* __Travis Good__,
  Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica Health, Inc.\n\nThe cloud is
  a key accelerator to enterprise innovation and has propelled a future around Big
  Data, AI, and data-driven decisions. But healthcare has had a challenging time adopting
  it due to compliance and risk concerns. In this session, experts discuss the business
  imperatives of cloud adoption, how it can act as an accelerant to innovation and
  growth, and then dive into how to properly manage risk in a way to facilitate organizational
  innovation. \n\nThe key insight: Develop a dynamic approach to moving to the cloud
  that fosters innovation and happens to be compliant!\n\n\n> We are excited to be
  a part of the Enterprise Risk Forum and to bring this dynamic session to the summit.
  Since the company’s founding five years ago, we’ve witnessed first-hand the industry’s
  hopes and frustrations in adopting the cloud due to compliance and risk concerns,”
  said Travis Good, MD, Datica CEO. “This panel provides the opportunity to create
  a dynamic open forum discussion that will help aid the healthcare industry’s cloud
  migration.”  \n \n## About Datica\n\nDatica de-risks the cloud for digital health
  with software that manages all ongoing compliance and security burdens not covered
