:summary: Healthcare customers gain compliance and security measurement with extension
  of HITRUST CSF Certification Workloads on AWS.
:post: "MADISON, WIS. (PRWEB) JULY 19, 2016\n\n[Catalyze][1], a trusted and mature
  platform for healthcare IT development teams, announced that the company’s compliant
  cloud platform is now HITRUST CSF Certified for its customers hosting workloads
  on [Amazon Web Services][2] (AWS). Catalyze passed its Common Security Framework
  (CSF) assessment from the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) — the industry’s
  benchmark for measuring compliance and security.\n\nCatalyze, utilizing AWS services
  and solutions, provides a fully managed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
  Act (HIPAA) compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified platform for the healthcare industry
  that offers development teams fast, flexible, and secure access to the cloud.\n\n\"Healthcare
  is an industry in the midst of transitioning to the cloud, and AWS is strategically
  positioned to service the healthcare industry's computing needs. AWS’s work with
  Catalyze, a company that focuses on meeting healthcare’s unique compliance needs
  through security frameworks like HITRUST, helps position AWS to play a key role
  in the health industry’s transformation,” said Josh Hofmann, Global Lead, Partner
  Ecosystem, Amazon Web Services, Inc.\n\nDurham-based [iScribes][3], a Catalyze customer,
  recognizes the need for such collaboration in securing patient data. “We now process
  about 36,000 medical charts a month,” said Christopher Kwiatkowski, iScribes Chief
  Technology Officer. “Without the fast and flexible cloud access from AWS, coupled
  with Catalyze’s HITRUST CSF Certified compliant layer, our work would be curtailed,
  significantly more costly, and the patient data we synthesize daily would be at
  risk.”\n\n[Healthcare compliance][4] presents a challenge for development teams.
  Minneapolis-based Zipnosis has experienced those challenges as it has scaled its
  virtual care technology. “Healthcare IT developers leverage the collaboration of
  AWS and its AWS Partner Network (APN) partners like Catalyze, so the unique compliance
  needs of the industry are addressed and supported,” said Derek Rockwell, Zipnosis’
  Director of Engineering. “We have been using AWS for five years, been working with
  Catalyze for three years, and the relationship has allowed us to further consolidate,
  secure, and optimize our infrastructure — giving us a significant edge.”\n\nAffirmation
  of Catalyze’s second HITRUST CSF Certification assessment of its platform, with
  an extension to AWS workloads provides customers with the following benefits: \n\n*
  Easier management of federal, state, and third-party security regulations\n* A simplified
  method to showcase a company as a trustworthy resource\n* Additional assurance that
  a company meets and exceeds the minimum requirements of Health Insurance  Portability
  and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n\nThe HITRUST Common Security Framework provides
  an efficient and prescriptive guideline for managing the security requirements found
  within HIPAA and one for which Catalyze customers have found great value. “The time,
  effort and expertise required for compliance is often more than our customers want
  to tackle themselves,” explained Catalyze President Mohan Balachandran. “A majority
  of our customers already use AWS as their cloud infrastructure of choice, so the
  extension of our HITRUST CSF Certification to include AWS workloads is beneficial
  for them.\"\n\n\n[1]: https://catalyze.io\n[2]: https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/sem-generic/free-b/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_hv_b&sc_content=aws_core_e&sc_detail=amazon%20web%20services&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=98921920362&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!98921920362!e!!g!!amazon%20web%20services&ef_id=VzSZWwAAAI2yHkPj:20160614203947:s\n[3]:
