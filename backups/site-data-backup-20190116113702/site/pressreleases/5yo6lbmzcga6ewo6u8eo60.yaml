    The Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) is a simple guide for the makers of digital healthcare products.

    The Internet is full of resources to help turn ideas into lean startups or businesses, but things are a little different in the wild wild west of digital health technology. There are considerations in healthcare not found in any other industry, and no one has time to learn them all.

    We’ve simplified the unique complexities to help you get your digital health products from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises. You will leave with a better understanding of how to manage the challenges ahead.

:summary: Teams and organizations across healthcare can follow the industry’s first
  roadmap to accelerate digital health success.
:post: "MADISON, WISC. (PRWEB) JULY 12, 2017\n\nDatica, the industry cloud platform
  for digital health applications, today announced its Digital Health Success Framework
  (DHSF). Digital health developers can use the detailed guide to take products from
  napkin scribble to market without any snags.\n\nLaunched in 2013, Datica has spent
  the past four years working with digital health companies that range from single-founder
  startups to Fortune 100 pharma companies and hospital providers. Patterns from thousands
  of conversations have emerged around topics like technology, cloud infrastructure,
  data exchange and compliance.\n\n“Unlike other industries where a pathway to success
  is straightforward, the healthcare industry has unique considerations not found
  elsewhere,” said Mark Olschesky, Datica’s chief data officer. “The DHSF takes those
  specific complexities, details the timelines and benchmarks for each, then simplifies
  the success process in an intelligent way that developers can clearly comprehend.”\n\nAccording
  to research and data analytics firm CB Insights, increases in digital health funding
  continued for the seventh straight year in 2016 with venture deals reaching $6.5B.
  Those financial deals have financially supported companies that want to “remedy
  the pain points of healthcare.” Investors distributed the majority of those funds
  to early-stage, seed and Series A companies. Yet, Datica has seen many of those
  well-intentioned companies struggle to reach market adoption. Research by Accenture
  in 2015 showed that more than 50 percent of all digital health startups are likely
  to fail within two years following their launch.\n\nDatica’s mission is to reduce
  that 50 percent rate. The Digital Health Success Framework plays the role of helping
  teams understand the major considerations which contribute to business risks and
  product burdens. “We’ve seen hundreds of digital health companies pass by in our
  position as a top startup incubator. Most of them struggle to understand what challenges
  stand between them and market adoption,” explained Joe Kirgues, co-founder of Gener8tor,
  a nationally ranked accelerator. “Datica’s Digital Health Success Framework can
  help organizations understand the unique considerations required for new products,
  which will help the healthcare ecosystem only get better at delivering stronger
  patient outcomes through new innovation.”\n\nFor more information on the Digital
  Health Success Framework, visit [https://datica.com/dhsf](https://datica.com/dhsf).
  The free resource charts dozens of important considerations for digital health teams
  along a four-year timeline, ranging from HIPAA compliance to pilot strategies.\n\n###
