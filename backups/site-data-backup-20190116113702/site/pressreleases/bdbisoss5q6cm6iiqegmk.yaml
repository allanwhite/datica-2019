:summary: Internal hire will accelerate the industry-wide adoption of the company’s
  platform for digital health success and will supply additional strategic direction
  as the company grows.
:post: "MADISON, WISC. (PRWEB) APRIL 26, 2017\n\nDatica, the industry platform for
  digital health success, today announced Kevin Lindbergh will lead the company’s
  revenue generating efforts and execute on an aggressive product development strategy
  begun in late 2016. As the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), Kevin will provide strategic
  direction for the sales, marketing, and product teams that help drive the company’s
  revenue streams, as well as identify new opportunities for growth.\n\n“As the board
  and I considered filling the newly created position of CRO, the wealth of talent
  from within our own team enabled us to tap a valuable internal source,” said Travis
  Good, MD, CEO, Datica. “Kevin will be accelerating our top-line revenue with hospital
  systems by drawing upon the expertise of Kris Gösser, vice president of marketing
  and Ryan Rich, Datica’s newly appointed vice president of product. Kevin will also
  provide oversight on the day-today sales efforts to digital health vendors.”\n\nKevin
  has a successful track record within Datica and was initially hired as the company’s
  Vice President of Sales in June 2015. With his deep expertise in healthcare, combined
  with a laser vision and strategy for company growth, he quickly recognized the significant
  potential Datica’s platform for digital health success could have on the market.\n\nDigital
  healthcare is messy, but Datica’s mission to connect patients and providers with
  the tools and data they need to optimize care is one that won’t be solved by putting
  an API on top of an electronic health record. “We know that a customer who has an
  immediate need for compliant hosting or managed integration will eventually need
  other pieces like strategic services to achieve scalable success within digital
  health,” explained Lindbergh. “The industry has become leery of the piecemeal approach,
  so Datica’s full stack delivery layer empowers development teams with knowledge
  that their technology efforts are anchored on our unified platform; feature sets
  can simply be expanded as needed.”\n\nMost recently, Kevin managed strategic relationships
  and did solution design at a startup focused on human capital management automation
  and enterprise collaboration. Prior to that, he held leadership positions in several
  healthcare organizations, including founding his own company focused on healthcare
  consumerism.\n\nAbout Datica \n\nDatica is the platform for digital health success.
  We solve the problem of HIPAA compliance in the cloud, and enable secure data exchange
  between digital health and EHRs. Customers and partners across healthcare trust
  Datica to ensure the barriers for digital health are removed so innovation can happen
  faster. For more information please visit http://www.datica.com."
