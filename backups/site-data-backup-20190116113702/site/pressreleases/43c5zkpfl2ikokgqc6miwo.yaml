:summary: Catalyze raises $6.5 million Series B financing. Lewis & Clark Ventures
  led the round, joined by existing investors Arthur Ventures, Baird Venture Partners
  and Chicago Ventures.
:post: "MADISON, WIS. (PRWEB) SEPTEMBER 21, 2016\n\nCatalyze, Inc., healthcare’s leading
  HITRUST CSF Certified cloud provider, announced today that it has raised $6.5 million
  in a Series B fundraising effort. St. Louis-based Lewis & Clark Ventures led the
  round, with participation of existing investors, Arthur Ventures, Baird Venture
  Partners and Chicago Ventures. The additional financing will allow Catalyze to accelerate
  growth with its core healthcare integration and hosting products and services. An
  expanded focus on sales and marketing will broaden efforts toward enterprise customers,
  such as hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies and payers.\n\nCatalyze tackled
  a tough challenge for healthcare development teams by building the first HIPAA compliant
  infrastructure, called Stratum. During multiple audits of its hosting infrastructure
  and successful completion of HITRUST CSF Certification, the company solved another
  challenge for developers with its end-to-end EHR integration product, Redpoint.
  Through the remainder of this year, Catalyze will solve other real-world problems
  for the healthcare, as the industry edges closer to value-based care. The challenge
  will be solved with novel insights through Catalyze, driven by data.\n\n“The need
  to empower and enable this healthcare transformation by bringing new and innovative
  technologies to the industry is something our firm values. As a leader in transformation,
  Catalyze has built practical solutions to drive healthcare interoperability,” said
  Brian Hopcraft, managing director of Lewis & Clark Ventures, as well as a newly
  added Catalyze board member. “We are excited to back Catalyze, a company that has
  built incredible industry trust and put together a team of skilled professionals
  who have unmatched expertise that is facilitating a more secure, innovative healthcare
  system.”\n\nThe latest investment round brings total Catalyze funding to more than
  $12.5 million since inception of its compliant cloud infrastructure. The industry
  has continued to recognize the company for its market leadership and benchmarks
  with compliant hosting and EHR integration, naming Catalyze as a semi-finalist for
  both a TripleTree iAward and an Innovations in Healthcare Abby Award this year.\n\n“It’s
  been an exceptional year for Catalyze, with strategic team hires that came with
  the highest government and enterprise security credentials, an appointment to the
  first HITRUST Business Associate Council, along with a rapidly expanding roster
  of customers,” said Catalyze CEO Travis Good, MD. “Those customers have offered
  our team the unique opportunity to solve a multitude of data exchange challenges
  that fall outside of traditional standards. With the financial support and domain
  expertise of Lewis & Clark Ventures and our other investors we look forward to introducing
  more key healthcare solutions in 2017.”\n\nAbout Catalyze, Inc. \n\nCatalyze provides
  an innovative HIPAA compliant, HITRUST CSF Certified platform with a complete set
  of modules to handle, store and transmit PHI securely in the cloud. Scalable, HIPAA
  compliant and interoperable infrastructure is powering the future of healthcare,
  so Catalyze has built the platform upon which an enterprise can hasten healthcare
  innovation without the need to become an overnight expert in compliance. For more
