:post: "Datica today announced the general availability of its new book titled Complete
  Cloud Compliance: How regulated companies de-risk the cloud and kickstart transformation.
  The book, co-authored by CEO Travis Good, MD, and CMO Kris Gösser, shares new insights
  pioneered by Datica's expertise at the intersection of healthcare and cloud computing.
  [Dr. Good previously announced the book](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-premiers-new-book-complete-cloud-compliance-at-2018-hitrust/)
  and detailed key concepts while speaking about the topic of cloud compliance at
  the 2018 HITRUST Annual Conference.\n\n## Why This Book is so Important\n\nThe cloud
  is a healthcare organization's biggest risk — if they don't adopt it. Regulated
  companies have a hard problem to solve. They run the existential risk of becoming
  obsolete due to an inability to adopt new technology rapidly enough. The cloud can
  help but balancing the requirements of compliance is difficult to understand. Complete
  Cloud Compliance gives the playbook for regulated companies to adopt the cloud with
  confidence.\n\nThe Complete Cloud Compliance book was written for those making healthcare
  better by enabling the industry’s triple aim — lower costs, better outcomes, better
  experience. Entrepreneurs just starting out and those who are part of larger organizations
  competing in the emerging new world order of data-driven healthcare will equally
  benefit from the ideas and frameworks presented in the book. \n\nThe biggest challenge
  for healthcare workloads on the cloud comes down to confusion among engineers and
  compliance officers. Most engineers don’t yet understand how compliance works and
  the path forward to attaining compliance. The engineering teams assume their technology
  is compliant until, to their detriment, risk assessments and audits confirm they
  are far off the mark.  At the same time, most compliance officers aren’t technical
  enough to keep pace with the rapid changes of the cloud, so are reluctant to include
  cloud services in their programs. This divide results in stagnation of digital health
  advancements. \n\n_The book is written to bridge that divide._\n\nEngineers learn
  the fundamentals of compliance to become relative experts by the end of the one
  hundred and twelve pages. Compliance owners are taught the basics of the cloud (and
  post-cloud world) to confidently enact an internal compliance program that empowers
  the cloud.\n\n“Given the prevalence of cloud services today and the many and varied
  ways in which they’re provided, healthcare organizations need to have a very good
  understanding of how sensitive health information is safeguarded in the cloud,”
  said Dr. Bryan Cline, vice president of standards analysis, HITRUST. “This includes
  who is responsible for specific security and privacy controls, whether it’s the
  healthcare organization, service provider or both. ‘Complete Cloud Compliance’ can
  greatly facilitate that understanding.” \n\n## Now Available online at Amazon, Barnes
  & Noble, and Blurb\n\nThe Complete Cloud Compliance book is now available for general
  purchase from three online retailers. Readers have their choice of purchasing a
  softcover version at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Cloud-Compliance-Risk-Transformation/dp/1364016451/)
  or [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/complete-cloud-compliance-travis-good-md/1129967731),
  or a hardcover version at [Blurb](www.blurb.com/b/9029120-complete-cloud-compliance-how-regulated-industries).
  The book is being sold at-cost in the hopes of having it shared broadly so the most
  people possible have access to its ideas. This aligns with Datica’s central tenets
  of transparency and a sincere desire to advance healthcare.\n\n## About Datica\n\nDatica
