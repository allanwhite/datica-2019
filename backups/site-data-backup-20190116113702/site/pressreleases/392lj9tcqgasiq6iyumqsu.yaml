:summary: Healthcare breakout session will provide insight into how hospital adoption
  of a standard compliance layer quickly led to innovative applications and stronger
  data integration with Electronic Health Records.
:post: "Datica, the cloud platform for digital health applications, today announced
  the selection of Adam Leko, the company’s chief technology officer and David Deas,
  Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare’s (MLH) corporate director, innovation & knowledge
  analytics, for a joint healthcare presentation on how to eliminate [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/)
  as a barrier to speed-to-market hospital development goals at this year’s AWS re:Invent
  conference.\n\n> In 2017, Datica has enabled several hospital systems to more effectively
  reduce capital and operational costs by safely and securely moving to the cloud
  in a compliant manner. This presentation will show how MLH uses the compliant Datica
  platform to ensure that the configuration and orchestration of Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) HIPAA-eligible services meet the controls set by the healthcare’s most stringent
  accreditation body, HITRUST, with every workload deployment. - Adam Leko, Datica\n\nWhile
  demand for on-premises infrastructure has diminished in healthcare, the adoption
  of cloud-based solutions has grown exponentially. Cloud computing is proving that
  it expands accessibility to healthcare data and Datica’s platform is helping those
  health systems interested in deploying digital health applications in the cloud
  to meet the rigorous security and [regulatory compliance standards](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/)
  of the industry.\n\n> By removing security concerns as a barrier to using cloud-based
  systems, Datica has opened up a new world of possibilities that we would otherwise
  have been too cautious to undertake. Leveraging the ease and expandability of the
  compliant Datica platform running on AWS we have greatly accelerated our Innovation
  team’s capabilities, which allows us to play out ‘what if’ scenarios without large
  capital commitments or burdensome ROI proofs. All of this has expanded the number
  of projects we can tackle and lead to a remarkable transformation in how we approach
  healthcare innovation. - David Deas, MLH\n\nThe Datica/MLH 60-minute live presentation,
  How Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare’s Focus on Standardizing Compliant Ops Led to
  Breakthrough Apps will take place on Monday, November 27 at the Venetian, Level
  2, Venetian F in Las Vegas at 12:15 Pacific Time.\n\nFor more information about
