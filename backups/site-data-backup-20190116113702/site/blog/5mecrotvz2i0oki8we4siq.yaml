:summary: The Summer 2018 Datica Quarterly Report has timely insights as healthcare
  grapples with GDPR, new privacy laws in CA, and forays into healthcare by the tech
  titans of Microsoft and Amazon.
:blog_lead: This latest [Datica Industry Report](https://datica.com/innovation/report-q2-2018-privacy-big-technology/)
  was an exciting package to put together. As we have done in [previous reports](https://datica.com/innovation/),
  we have curated some of the more insightful articles and commentary from publications
  around the web. Certainly, there’s a lot of privacy news out there. We think it’s
  timely as the Healthcare industry grapples with GDPR, new privacy legislation in
  California and, seemingly, more aggressive healthcare industry efforts by the technology
  titans of Microsoft and Amazon.
:post: "\nA fascinating section of the report includes two studies worth diving into:\n\n*
  The Cloud Security Report by Cybersecurity Insiders and Crowd Research Partners.
  What’s noteworthy: The study is based on 400,000 security professionals on LinkedIn.\n*
  Deloitte’s report, “Healthcare and Life Sciences Predictions 2020”. It’s thoughtful
  and smart.\n\nMy takeaway from all the recent privacy/security news in the healthcare
  space and the general business and consumer landscape is what I recently wrote in
  a forthcoming book we are authoring about compliance:\n\n> Complying with regulations
  on protecting patient data privacy sounds like it should be pretty cut and dried,
  right? The government sets rules and companies follow them, or else they are penalized.
  In fact, compliance is a bit more squishy than that, because it needs to evolve
  and respond to the ongoing changes in the market that are caused by digital transformation.
  \n\n> Healthcare is no different from any industry where technology is rapidly changing.
  You see this whenever a new technology comes along. Over time, everyone — humans,
  cultures, businesses, industries — have had a hard time understanding the legal,
  social, and ethical consequences of a brand new development. They find themselves
  asking, ‘Well, what do we do with this technology now that it’s a thing?’ You can
  already project into the future what happens when, say, we can finally splice genes
  the right way. People will be asking, what do we do now that we can change our eye
  color on the fly?\n\n> Compliance behaves like a lagging indicator. It’s just a
  part of regulation and regulation has tried to keep up with the pace of technology.\n\nWe
  hope you enjoy this edition of the [Datica Quarterly Report](https://datica.com/innovation/report-q2-2018-privacy-big-technology/).

  :summary: 'Datica''s Winter 2017 quarterly industry report examines the paradox
    of shadow IT in healthcare. Is it a security threat or enabler for innovation? '
  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica.com/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica.com/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica.com/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica.com/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

  :summary: Our latest industry report takes a look at various opinions and definitions
    on public vs. private cloud computing within healthcare.
  :blog_lead: 'Last quarter, we published our first industry report titled [The Heart
    of Medicine: Transformation Through Technology](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around
    the topic of "cloud" within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between
    a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the
    cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress
    of digital health.'
  :post: |-
    Each quarter we will bring a similar report focused on a key topic related to healthcare technology. The shape of a report can take many forms. One quarter might be an extensive data study while another quarter might be an aggregation of industry views. Regardless of the style of report, the intent remains the same: Inform the digital health market with insights that can help them be successful. _There is no strategy without intelligence._

    Today we are happy to share our latest report titled [Public and Private Cloud Computing within Healthcare](https://datica.com/innovation/public-vs-private-cloud-computing-within-healthcare-summer-2017/). The premise of this report is simple: the debate between Public vs. Private cloud models is ongoing, yet many digital health companies we speak with aren't exactly sure their definitions, nor which model might be a fit for them. The [cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) is expansive and complex. This report is meant to help breakdown the differences between the two, and source industry insights related to what is a good fit for healthcare.

    Feedback is always welcome. Let us know what you think on Twitter at @daticahealth!

  :blog_lead: 'Migrating organizational data to the cloud is one of a number of concerns

    a survey on the topic [during and after HIMSS18](https://datica.com/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).
    Members of the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)
    answered questions regarding their organizations’ plans and efforts to move their
    data to the cloud. The results reveal that many healthcare organizations are in
    a holding pattern. '
  :post: "Cloud storage has the potential to change healthcare in positive ways, from
    administration efficiencies to population health. An array of new opportunities
    for providers await when moving data storage into the cloud. But, there’s a long
    way to go before that potential can be realized.\n\n## Cloud adoption is a top
    priority, but not in full throttle mode\n\nAbout 80% of the survey respondents
    said that cloud hosting is in the top 20 priorities within their organizations;
    however, only around 30% said they have a strategy for that data migration. Such
    massive operational changes take time. We need only look at healthcare’s recent
    past with implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) to see the truth
    in that statement. \n\n*JUST RELEASED: Get Datica’s [2018 CIO Cloud Perspectives
    Survey here](https://datica.com/innovation/healthcare-cloud-take-off-waiting-for-fog-clear/)*\n\nThose
    organizations that have already made the cloud leap are innovating: 32% are using
    the cloud to build machine learning applications, and 45% are creating applications
    to improve population health. With the possibility of such uses, why are some
    organizations hesitating? \n\nOne of the biggest concerns survey respondents cite
    is around security. Roughly 50% said it is a primary worry. Given the regulatory
    landscape and the sensitivity of protected health information (PHI), it’s not
    surprising that security is a top concern. As cloud hosting becomes a more viable
    option, new tools are emerging to give healthcare organizations greater control
    over their data, which will help dissipate concerns about data security. \n\nAnother
    barrier for some organizations is the lack of a clear business value in storing
    data in the cloud. About 40% of the executives who took the survey said that things
    like what to do with existing equipment or how their organization would make practical
    use of cloud storage impedes the shift.\n\n## Some are taking to the cloud, others
    remain grounded\n\nAlmost 20% of survey respondents reported that their organizations
    are already hosting 50% or more of their software infrastructure remotely. An
    additional 14% said at least a quarter to half of their infrastructure is hosted
    remotely. That means just over one-third of the organizations represented in the
    Datica survey are discovering what works, what possibilities are opened, and how
    the cloud might improve healthcare delivery. \n\nConversely, about 20% of the
    executives said that migrating data storage to the cloud was not a current priority
    for their organization. [Regulatory compliance](https://datica.com/platform/),
    security, and privacy are all concerns, among others. \n\nIn the broadest terms,
    the survey seems to show that executives are aware of the potential of the cloud,
    both for improving healthcare delivery as well as for data breaches. As is always
    the case, some organizations are innovating and pushing the limits of what is
    possible, while others take a wait-and-see attitude. \n\n\n"

    from The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Harvard Business Review, and Healthtech
    News, Datica’s Spring 2018 innovation report finds that there are some specific,
    and perhaps surprising trends in digital innovation. From hospitals supporting
    startups to the competition for data that artificial intelligence is bringing
    about, the four articles touch on current hot button topics. \n\nIn a story titled
    [“Hospitals Fund Potential Game-Changers in Health Tech”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-vie-to-fund-a-health-tech-breakthrough-1520430189)
    the Wall Street Journal reports on how some hospitals are beginning to fund health-tech
    startups in the hopes of supporting innovation that will result in improvements.
    Hospitals are in a good position to decide which innovative projects to support
    because hospitals have the clearest understanding of their own problems that need
    to be solved. \n\nThe Economist tackles the topic of medical data and technologies
    surrounding it in an article titled [“Data and medicine: A revolution in healthcare
    is coming.”](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming)
    Applications that detect heart arrhythmia or that have diagnostics capabilities
    are powerful, as are those that may improve the management of chronic disease.
    However, the article misses the mark in its implication that those types of technologies
    are on the verge of widespread adoption. Such innovations will change healthcare,
    but it will happen gradually. \n\nPatient-centered is a phrase that appears in
    almost every discussion of digital health innovation, and the Harvard Business
    Review examines the importance of keeping the patient front and center in an article
    titled [“Putting Humans at the Center of Health Care Innovation.”](https://hbr.org/2018/03/putting-humans-at-the-center-of-health-care-innovation)
    Innovation is most important when it puts people, rather than money, at the center.
    \n\nAdvancing innovation in digital health is going to require a migration to
    the cloud, according to an article in Healthtech News titled [“Eric Schmidt lays
    out formula for healthcare innovation.”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/eric-schmidt-lays-out-formula-healthcare-innovation)
    Moving to the cloud will mean having an infrastructure that is tested, interoperable,
    and secure. However, AI is going to require data acquisition because it depends
    on large datasets to determine algorithmic success. \n\n## Reports from the Experts\n\nReports
    from institutions, academic organizations, and consulting firms often contain
    insights that aren’t always obvious from interactions with partners and customers.
    The Datica spring innovation report includes summaries from two such reports:
    the [Accenture Digital Health Technology Vision 2017](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-digital-health-tech-vision-2017)
    and the [World Economic Forum report.](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/healthcare-building-a-digital-healthcare-system/)
    \n\nEach of the reports points to trends that are going to impact the digital
    health transformation. AI, digital ecosystems, open marketplaces for talent, the
    need for better understanding human behavior, and entirely new digital industries
    are all mentioned in the Accenture report. The World Economic Forum included discussion
    of how to build a digital healthcare system that will empower people. \n\n## Heavyweights
    at HIMSS18\n\nMicrosoft has always been involved in [HIMSS](https://datica.com/blog/himss18-recap-invasion-major-tech-providers/),
    but this year their focus was less on Azure and more on the Microsoft solutions
    on the cloud. AWS had a bigger presence than ever before at HIMSS, and featured
    demonstrations of solutions to specific healthcare problems. \n\nGoogle put on
    a show bigger than either Microsoft or AWS, with a major booth and high profile
    sessions and keynotes. However, it wasn’t clear exactly what cloud-based solutions
    Google is offering the healthcare sector. \n\nTelehealth and population health
    have matured. They are no longer coming soon but have arrived. Both technologies
    are now part of the health IT landscape. \n\nIT was also clear at HIMSS18 that
    there’s more innovation happening than necessarily meets the eye. New projects
    in digital health products as well as internal innovation within organizations
    are likely to spur rapid improvements in the near future. \n\nThe full [Datica
    Spring 2018 innovation report](https://datica.com/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
    elucidates the sources currently driving the digital health transformation. By
    pulling together unique perspectives on disparate topics, Datica clearly describes
    the innovation situation and how it’s impacting digital health. \t\t\t\t\t\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
