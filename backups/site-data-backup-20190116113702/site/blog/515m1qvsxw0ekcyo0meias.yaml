:summary: This Q&A with Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, explores what
  it means that Datica just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies.
:blog_lead: |-
  A week ago, Chief Data Officer [Mark Olschesky](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/mark/) used Slack to announce that Datica had just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies. Of course, the company wise-crackers quickly posted the obligatory Yogi Berra response:

  > When you come to a fork in the road, take it!
:post: "As with many technical terms, the word “fork” obviously had more than one
  meaning. The mention of this particular company achievement, along with its oddly
  referenced name suddenly had my non-technical mind driving for answers. I needed
  to uncover not only what a “fork” was, but also why having 200 of them came with
  so many “thumbs up” and “clapping hand” emoticons. The discovery called for a quick
  Q&A with none other than torchbearer himself, [Mark Olschesky](/about/mark/). \n\n####
  Q: Just what is a “fork” in technical terms?\n\n**Mark:**  A fork is a term for
  duplicating a code or document repository. It’s not required. Someone could simply
  download the source from the repository without us knowing at all. In the open-source
  world, “forks” and “stars” are a common way to track the success of a project. We
  use [GitHub to host our policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies/); there,
  you can track all changes made to the policies by reviewing forks made by our customers.\n\n####
  Q: Participating in open-source projects has been strategic for Datica, can you
  tell me more about its importance to the company?\n\n**Mark:** When the company
  was founded in 2013, the industry had its share of duplicitous vendors peddling
  “HIPAA-compliant” solutions for hosting and application development. Turns out that
  many of those solutions were far from compliant. As a company that, 1) wanted to
  do more to make compliance in the cloud easier and, 2) was not the first HIPAA-compliant
  vendor, the company needed to go the extra mile to prove our compliance and differentiate
  the company from the rest of the market beyond base market copy.\n\n#### Q: How
  did that differentiation begin?\n\n**Mark:** During Datica’s first HITRUST audit,
  CEO Travis Good, MD saw the potential for sharing what we’d learned with the entire
  industry via open-source policies. He then made the following strategic decisions:\n\n-
  Datica should publish our policies in a way that allows them to be easily tracked
  over time (GitHub).\n- We should open-source the policies to both engender goodwill
  with the developer community and to also demonstrate the lengths that Datica goes
  for its customers versus other “HIPAA-compliant” vendors. \n- Provide a way for
  other companies with existing infrastructure or that didn’t want to host with Datica
  to fork those policies and make them their own. As such, we would show different
  flavors of how to demonstrate compliance with different application stacks or organizational
  differences.\n\n#### Q: How does forking of our open-source policies help healthcare
  in general?\n\n**Mark:** As a company, Datica does not manage all the parts of HIPAA.
  For example, we don’t employ clinicians or have software that performs medical decision-making
  or automated outreach to patients. As such, it’s hard for our policies to be the
  definitive guide for “what it means to be HIPAA compliant.”\n\n#### Q: That sounds
  counterintuitive to the ultimate goal of HIPAA compliance. Can you explain how forks
  play into that?\n\n**Mark:** By looking at forks, you can see what other customers
  have done. Most commonly, you can see companies with different Business Associate
  Agreements (BAAs). You’ll also see some major material differences through the forks.
  \n\n#### Q: Can you give me a good example of a fork?\n\n**Mark:** One is Bind.
  As an insurer/broker (and therefore likely a [Covered Entity](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
  their policies will differ from Datica’s as a cloud infrastructure/tooling provider.
  Bind’s willingness to share what they’ve done could help other insurers or brokers
  with their path to build and demonstrate compliance. That can save everyone time
  and money. That savings allows organizations to work on the real problems in healthcare.\n\n####
  Q: When the 200th fork came in from the Chief Technology Officer of a care coordination
  platform, you shared this good news with the entire company. Why was this an important
  achievement?\n\n**Mark:** Many open-source projects don’t receive much attention,
  so it’s great to see that Datica’s open-sourced policies are one of the more popular
  open source projects in healthcare compliance. The Linux Foundation took a similar
  approach a year later in [publishing their policies](https://github.com/lfit/itpol).
  Datica is proud to be one of the earlier innovators in a space that facilitates
  transparency in best practices by publishing those policies. As a company we strive
  to constantly do what’s best for our customers, but also the industry as a whole.\n"

  :summary: HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. To make compliance
    easier for companies working with PHI, we open source our HIPAA policies.
  :blog_lead: 'Today is a big day for us, and for those businesses striving for HIPAA
    compliance. [Starting today, we are open sourcing all our company policies.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)
    Are you a company who handles PHI and trying to achieve HIPAA compliance? Then
    you''ll find what we are about to share compelling and useful.

'
  :post: |
    Achieving [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) generally has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Encryption, logging, monitoring, backup—these are just a few examples. Since the beginning, Datica has worked every day to take on these technical burdens for our customers.

    The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities, and these are where _your_ company policies come into play. Non-technical guidelines include signing [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), risk management procedures, and policies for training, among many other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

    When we were creating our policies, we found several templates for healthcare providers, but nothing for modern health technology companies. We spent a vast amount of time and effort writing our policies, then adapting them to meet the demands of external audits. We don't want people to reinvent the wheel; trust us, it's not fun. We also feel a broader community can improve these polices over time, making them better for everybody.

    By open sourcing our own company policies, we hope other healthcare companies will benefit. It aligns with our company mission: to help you focus on fixing healthcare without spending all of your time on HIPAA.

    The policies are hosted on GitHub, the premier public platform for open-sourced content. [To read more, head over to the project's homepage.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)

    Let us know if you find these useful!

  :post: "![Old office](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2eMSsIeNu8YcUuOW6qkEYS/6980a750bcb5cf100747466b6cb69a7e/Datica_old_office.001.png?fm=jpg)\n*That's
    me in 2015, in the background of a photo in Datica's original office.* \n \n*Editor's
    note: As we roll out updates and changes to our new Kubernetes-based compliance
    platform our pricing is fluxuating and we're temporarily back to providing custom
    quotes based on specific configurations. Learn more about our [public product
    roadmap](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-were-building-daticas-public-product-roadmap/)
    and the exciting things happening at Datica* \n\nWe've done a lot of work since
    then, and we've now changed our opinion on the topic. We now offer up front Datica
    pricing right on the website: [https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/).
    I'd like to go through my old article and discussed what changed and why we now
    offer upfront pricing.\n\n1) \"First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead
    to buyer confusion.\" & 2) \"Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges
    comparisons with companies who weren’t direct competitors.\"\n \nRealistically,
    our largest competitors in the compliant cloud space aren’t other PaaS vendors
    but rather DIY solutions on one of the major IaaS vendors like Amazon or Azure.
    At the time, it was hard to communicate exactly what the total cost of ownership
    for build vs. buy would be, since we didn’t fully understand our costs as we were
    building infra at scale and going through our initial sets of audits. We've since
    written massive amounts of documentation on the subject: our [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    and [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) guides provide in depth details
    on effort and costs while our [open-sourced policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies)
    provide a detailed roadmap of what it takes to prove HITRUST certification if
    you were going to DIY.  If you work in a \"We build everything 100% here\" shop,
    you'll find the policies useful for your own build-outs. If you are looking to
    partner with a vendor, we now can provide you with the data to demonstrate that
    we provide the best value on the market.\n \n3) Third, we saw that often prospects
    weren’t entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose
    neither.\n \nDatica is the platform on which everything is built. Compliance is
    the top requirement for all digital health applications and it's where developers
    looking to build or move to the cloud need to begin. Something like integration
    is built on top of the platform, in a complementary fashion. We didn't know how
    to communicate this best in 2015 and we probably didn't help ourselves with mountain
    climbing analogies later that year with Redpoint and Stratum. We've figured out
    better ways to communicate that we want to be your one stop shop for all your
    tough challenges in building digital health products in the cloud — above hosting
    and interface engines.\n \n4) Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of
    the Lean Startup movement: We want to talk to people.\n \nDon't worry! We're still
    out talking to people. We just don't need to bake it into all pieces of the sales
    process if you aren't interested anymore. In fact, we used a lot of feedback and
    discussions from customers and prospects to build the [Digital Health Success
    Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/).\n \nWhile we made it easier to see our pricing
    and features, we still want to talk. It might be our midwestern roots, but we
    want to learn more about what you're working on and the challenges you're going
    through on your projects. We want to help, even if it means we send you along
    to someone else. Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/)!\n\n"

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: We've taken our commitment to open source and Kubernetes a step further
    by becoming a silver member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
  :blog_lead: As any of the 200+ people who have already forked Datica’s open source
    compliance policies can attest, we’ve always been a big believer in the value
    and spirit of open source. Last year our open source commitment evolved to include
    [Open Source Connectors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)
    to help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. Most recently, the open
    source project [Kubernetes&reg;](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/)
    became the fundamental technical management layer for Datica. To take this commitment
    even further, we’re thrilled to announce we’ve become one of the newest silver
    members of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF),
    home of Kubernetes.
  :post: "  \nSince 2015, Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container
    management, lending the best tools for workload deployment on public clouds. In
    addition to being cross-cloud compatible and open source, the CNCF Kubernetes
    project and community have grown at a tremendous pace. In fact, the [CNCF announced
    Datica as one of it’s 19 newest members](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-reaches-236-members-including-54-end-users-300671019.html)
    last week, bringing the membership level to 236 companies. What really makes [Kubernetes
    a viable option](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) is not the core
    project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround it.\n\nWe’re
    excited for what the future holds in this open-source-fueled era of rapid development
    and are particular excited to step into this future in partnership with the CNCF
    to collaborate with other Kubernetes developers who are trying to build secure
    and compliant products. \n\nTake a look at the [press release announcing our CNCF

  :summary: If you're new to container orchestration and more familiar with a fully
    managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS), Kubernetes can seem complex. Learn the differences
    and tradeoffs.
  :blog_lead: Kubernetes® is dominating in 2018. If you're not already thinking about
    Kubernetes or at least containerization, then you're behind. Fortunately, containers
    and cloud native architectures have never been more accessible or easier to get
    started with. From infrastructure providers like AWS and Azure offering their
    own [versions of managed Kubernetes](https://sysdig.com/blog/ecs-fargate-eks-kubernetes-aws-compared/),
    to organizations like Cloud Foundry offering [Kubernetes services](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/),
    the world is shifting toward containers.
  :post: "\nIf you're working inside of a regulated industry, like healthcare or finance,
    these tools may seem out of reach. The compliance requirements and security restrictions
    of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP, NIST, PCI, and more can seem like impossible hurdles
    to jump when it comes to adopting a platform like Kubernetes.\nThis is exactly
    why [Datica is shifting toward Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    Our customers are asking for it, it’s the future of managing workloads born in
    the cloud, and Datica is already the most robust solution for compliance management
    on the planet. \n\nIf you're new to container orchestration and more familiar
    with a fully managed platform, like Heroku or Datica's legacy product, Kubernetes
    can seem complex. The goal of this article is to compare Kubernetes with a traditional
    PaaS, discuss the differences, and examine the tradeoffs.\n\n> Now that the world
    has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools have become ever
    larger and more complex.\n\n## What is a PaaS?\n\nA Platform as a Service, or
    a PaaS is intended to create a layer of abstraction on top of cloud service providers
    (or in some cases data centers and bare metal) so the end user can focus on deploying,
    managing, and scaling their applications and data. Without going into the [history
    of the PaaS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/) concept,
    it's easy to think about it as a way of automating many of the repetitive, lower-level
    tasks of managing workloads on a server.\n\n## How a PaaS works\n\nThe most well
    known PaaS providers are [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
    and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). These systems work when
    developers make minimal configuration changes to their application's code and
    then simply \"push\" their code to the cloud. The PaaS will then make an attempt
    to understand the code, install the required dependencies, containerize the application,
    and then serve it up. These providers then have a UI layer for managing resources,
    networking, access, and more.\n\n## The benefits of a PaaS\n\nBeing able to directly
    push your code to the cloud and have it running is a tremendous benefit over the
    old days of standing up a server, installing an operating system (and then patching
    it each time there's a vulnerability), getting nginx configured properly, and
    much more. With a PaaS, developers can focus on delivering value via their product,
    not building IT infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being able to simply push your
    code and have it running, many of these PaaS providers also couple database managed
    services as part of their Platform.\n\n## The pitfalls of a PaaS\n\nThe ease of
    use for a PaaS comes at the cost of flexibility. Want to install custom software
    on an instance? Nope. Want to ssh into an instance to investigate an issue that
    isn't appearing in the logs? Nope. Want to do anything beyond a simple Ruby, Python,
    or Node app? Good luck.\n\nA PaaS serves a very specific purpose — to help small
    teams with simple applications run those in the cloud without the DevOps overhead
    of managing a fleet of instances on AWS or Azure.\n\nThe primary reason why so
    many PaaS providers have failed to make substantial headway in the enterprise
    space is because the model is so restrictive. For an organization managing hundreds
    of applications with petabytes of data, it makes more sense to build out a team
    that can manage all of it instead of making substantial changes to your business
    in order to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\n## Enter Kubernetes and containers\n\nNow
    that the world has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools
    have become ever larger and more complex. A small organization that just three
    years ago could have survived on Heroku is now growing at a pace that prohibits
    them from continuing to use a restrictive PaaS. Maybe they're exploring machine
    learning or want a data warehouse. Whatever the case, they've outgrown the PaaS
    model. Now they need to move to something more flexible: Kubernetes.\n\nSince
    the invention of containers, and specifically with the popularity of Docker, organizations
    have been figuring out easier ways to orchestrate containers — that is, how to
    get them running, connected and served up in the cloud. In a way, orchestration
    is the primary function of a PaaS. Because containers are relatively trivial to
    build (and in most cases the build process can be automated, ex: [Gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/))
    the focus in the container space has been on orchestration.\n\n## The benefits
    of containers\n\nThe benefits of containers over virtual machines has been discussed
    to no end on the internet. I won't go into detail here, but simply put — with
    containers, developers can port their applications from machine to machine whether
    that's running it locally on a Mac, on a server in AWS or on a droplet on Digital
    Ocean. A container is a container and it can run anywhere. Compare this to the
    complexity of managing an entire fleet  VM, each with its own OS. With containers
    there’s only one operating system to manage, even with hundreds of containers.\n\n##
    Why Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes and containers have many of the same benefits. They
    can both run anywhere and they both function the same whether they're running
    on AWS, Azure, GCP, or in the locked closet down the hall. Kubernetes is open
    source, financially backed by hundreds of organizations, and is managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). In addition to being
    cross-cloud compatible and open source, Kubernetes has also shown tremendous growth
    in the last year.\n\nIf you’re coming from a PaaS you’ll no doubt have concerns
    around the ease of use and lack of automated DevOps support in Kubernetes. When
    I first explored Kubernetes in late 2014 I walked away feeling like it was too
    complicated and didn’t fit Datica’s customer use case. In 2018 it’s a different
    story.\n\nSince Kubernetes officially hit 1.0 in 2015, the community and project
    have grown at a tremendous pace. What really makes Kubernetes a viable option
    is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround
    it. Kubernetes isn’t a PaaS, it’s a foundation on which to build a PaaS.\n\nThink
    of Kubernetes and the cloud native community as a set of building blocks. With
    these building blocks you can construct any number of different solutions. No
    longer are you held back or restricted by PaaS providers. \n\n## Which to choose\n\nThe
    decision to choose Kubernetes over a PaaS (or vice versa) is going to depend on
    your business, technology, market, team, and several other factors. Having said
    that, even if you currently have a simple application with a relatively smaller
    user base, you’re likely going to scale and change rapidly. Preparing for the
    future by moving to containers now is going to save you time and money when it
    becomes critical later on.\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
