:summary: Why do focusing on niche offerings make so much sense in health and wellness?
:blog_lead: '2013, and to a lesser extent 2012, saw the growth and success of niche-based
  health IT offerings. Both on the provider side, with specialty specific EHRs like
  those from Modernizing Medicine, and on the patient side, with apps and services
  like [Telcare](http://www.telcare.com/), [Propellor Health](http://propellerhealth.com/),
  [Ovuline](http://www.ovuline.com/), Direct Dermatology, and now [Kurbo Health](http://www.datrihealth.com/).

:post: "In 2014 we'll see more and more niche-based health IT launches, in part because
  of the examples of the successes listed above, and in part because having a niche
  1) helps vendors say \"no\" to things that don't fit, 2) allows vendors to know
  customers and their needs really well (workflows, integration points, etc), and
  3) helps vendors develop a go to market strategy and early champion customers; I
  think investors also like niche assuming the niche is large enough for the investor
  to have an interest.\r\n\r\nWhy do niche offerings make so much sense in health
  and wellness? Simply put, health and wellness is extremely broad. Focusing on a
  niche is smart, mainly for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- **Healthcare is increasingly
  specialized**. Providers spend years in training to become experts in a very specific
  field. And the increasing popularity of fellowships makes medical specialties even
  more niche. It's getting to a point where providers, and even clinics sometimes,
  are devoted to just one condition. This specialization results in medical fields
  that hardly resemble one another - in practice, workflows, data, and tools. One
  of the major gripes with meaningful use is that the targets were created by and
  for primary care, and don't fit very well with many specialties. The reality is
  that the charting needs of an ophthalologist, who now could be either general, retina,
  oculoplastics, glaucoma, pathology, or corneal, are very different from those of
  a primary care outpatient physician (and a host of other specialties). Flipping
  the equation, the needs of the patients with these varying conditions are similarly
  different.\r\n- **Targets are exceptionally diverse**. Health and wellness cut across
  all segments of the population - from newborn to elderly, rich to poor, across languages
  and cultures, acute to chronic, and lifestyle to congenital. That means building
  one size fits all solutions is not only challenging, it's pretty close to impossible.
  If you look at the provider side you see a range of users from tech savvy Twitter
  users in their 20s to 70 year olds that just want to get to retirement before they
  have to use an EHR.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with niche offerings and specialization
  in technology is that it leads to fragmentation in the market. It's very hard for
  large enterprises, which are getting larger all the time, that are looking for one
  size fits all solutions, to consider a mashup of niche solutions. And if an enterprise
  has the confidence to try multiple EHRs and apps for its providers and members/customers,
  how much is it going to cost to integrate the data from all of those apps, whether
  those apps are on the provider side or on the patient side. Ideally more granular
  integration standards will emerge, such as [HL7 FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/).\r\n\r\nSo
  what niche offerings are most likely to see the largest interest? The most likely
  targets are common conditions like diabetes, conditions with limited access to resources
  like dermatology, high volume specialties where volume is king like dermatology
  and ophthalmology, conditions that can be treated remotely like psychiatry, and
  acute conditions with engaged patients like obstetrics and oncology.\r\n\r\nA niche
  that's exciting to watch takeoff is pediatric, or kids, health. Companies like [Zamzee](https://www.zamzee.com/),
  [Sqord](https://www.sqord.com/), and more recently Kurbo Health are entering this
  niche. Pediatric health is a huge determinant of adult health, and early lifestyle
  inventions are very powerful.\r\n\r\nCurious if others are seeing this niche trend
  in digital health? Is it sustainable?\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the rest of our coverage
  of 2014 trends. We'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts on the market. Please
