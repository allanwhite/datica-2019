:summary: The cost of a HIPAA audit depends on audit type – HIPAA gap assessment,
  full HIPAA audit, or validated HITRUST assessment – and indirect costs like time.

  > You must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. — Andrew Jackson

  At Datica we've been through [three external audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/hitrust/) conducted by a large, national auditing firm. In all three cases, I've personally led the efforts from our side, coordinating our internal resources as needed. I wouldn't call it a fun process, but it has helped add rigor to our internal security and compliance programs. It validated the hard work we've done to build a fully [HIPAA compliant platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), and associated organization, that exceeds the HIPAA rules. We've also learned what does and does not meet HIPAA standards from an external or auditor perspective.
:post: "Cost seems to be one of a few gating factors for companies considering a HIPAA
  audit. It's certainly a topic we are asked about constantly. I touched on the cost
  of audits in my last post on [proving HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/).
  If you look at the cost of a HIPAA audit, it breaks into two broad categories.\n\n1.
  Direct costs\n2. Indirect costs.\n\nLet's walk through how costs are calculated
  in both.\n\n## Direct Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nThe easier bucket to calculate.
  It begins with the costs for an auditing firm to conduct the audit and deliver a
  report. Curiously, the auditor's charge is frequently used by most people use to
  calculate the overall cost of an audit, which is definitely not accurate. Different
  types of HIPAA audits exist. The costs are different for each. Datica has completed
  all of the audits below.\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment**. The best starting point.
  It is meant to identify gaps and remediation plans for those gaps. It's the cheapest
  option and least time consuming. It often does not require an onsite visit from
  an auditor. A gap assessment leads to a full HIPAA audit; after the gap assessment,
  organizations spend time addressing the gaps before beginning a full HIPAA audit.
  **The direct cost is about $15,000-$20,000.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit**. A full HIPAA
  audit, when applied to technology vendors, assesses an organization against all
  the [requirements in HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
  It's a long list. It includes both technical settings and configurations as well
  as administrative requirements like training and business associate agreements.
  It will involve an auditor visit and will require documentation to support claims
  about security and compliance; this can include showing specific technology settings
  like password rules and guest access. **The direct cost is about $20,000-$25,000.**\n*
  **Validated HITRUST Assessment**. HITRUST is a more [complete, certifiable version
  of HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/). It was created by large healthcare
  enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but goes
  into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance programs.
  There's now a standard web app that you use to enter information. Those entries
  are then validated by HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization,
  reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you hopefully get
  HITRUST CSF Certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees to
  HITRUST and to your auditor (approved assessor). **The direct cost is about $30,000-$45,000**
  (cost can be much higher for larger organizations).\n\n## Indirect Costs of a HIPAA
  Audit\n\n> It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.
  - Steve Jobs\n\nIndirect costs are harder to quantify. The biggest factor to consider
  is time. For each of the types of audit above, the indirect costs increases as you
  move down the list. For each of our audits, we estimated the total time spent for
  all employees (we didn't break it out by each employee so it's not perfect).\n\n*
  **Gap Assessment: 40 hours.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit: 100 hours.**\n* **Validated
  HITRUST Assessment: 200 hours.**\n\nEqually hard to estimate was the time spent
  between each audit to address issues and \"harden\" our compliance and info sec
  programs. This time was not captured for any of the specific audits and contributes
  to the overall cost of compliance.\n\n## Total Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nWe conservatively
  estimated the cost of an hour of work to be $100/hour. This is partially loss for
  the cost of salaries + benefits and partially loss from opportunity cost of not
  doing other things with this time (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing,
  etc). Based on those numbers, the total cost of the different audits are:\n\n* **HIPAA
  Gap Assessment - $17,800-$22,800.** \n* **Full HIPAA Audit - $27,000-$32,000.**\n*
  **Validated HITRUST Assessment - $44,000-$59,000.** \n\n## It's more than cost\n\nIf
  you are considering an audit, cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming
  and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for
  your organization. For us, it was a nobrainer because our audits are part of our
  value proposition to customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales
  without having done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even
  very large deals.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the cost of an audit
  is not simply a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual
  reviews, sort of like miniature audits. These too cost money, eat time, and can
  be a distraction. We're working on calculating the overall cost of being [HIPAA
  compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) so stay tuned for more
  soon. Also, if you have audit insights you can share, [we'd love to hear them](mailto:hello@datica.com).\n\n"

  :blog_lead: 'In a world where technology, healthcare, and business are all integrated,
    a thorough understanding of semantics is critical, especially when [PHI (protected
    health information)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    is at risk. No matter what your relationship with HIPAA may be, knowing the difference

    some even bigger costs.

  :post: |
    A general rule of thumb is to be very chary when providers of hosting platforms are claiming to be “HIPAA ready” or “HIPAA certified”; preferably target potential business partners that are “HIPAA audited” or “HIPAA compliant.” Just about any technology can be considered HIPAA ready but what do vendors really mean when they say that? All that being “ready” affirms is that the scope of your audit is extended to include those components. This will require your internal information security team to approve the system architecture in comprehensive detail prior to commencement, which will lengthen or even prevent you from launching your program.

    On the other hand, [Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/), a proven and audited [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) platform, is healthcare’s trusted service in digital health for a reason. Our customers utilize our audit reports, policy page, and HIPAA mappings as the foundation of their compliance programs. With a [HIPAA ready platform service](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), the reliance you can foster in that provider is defunct from the very beginning.

    At Datica, we have taken the burden of compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training, etc.) so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) is even used as evidence to auditors to prove certain qualifications of HIPAA. These benefits of authentic HIPAA compliance are lost when falling into the wordplay trap that these HIPAA ready hosting services and platforms advertise.

    In this day and age, a critical mistake that healthcare organizations make in concerns to HIPAA is assuming  compliance is as simple as implementing security tools to prevent PHI breaches, or implementing assessment procedures that can potentially catch problems before proving to be incidental. Although HIPAA is a regulation that can be complex and difficult to fully grasp, there is one thing that should be commonly understood:

    **Just because you’re _HIPAA Ready_ does not mean that you are ready for HIPAA.**

  :blog_lead: 'In this second entry of our [Assessment Series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hipaa-compliance-assessment/)
    we explore what a HIPAA Risk Assessment is and why it is crucial in ensuring the
    safe-handling of [protected health information (PHI)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    with the growing dependency on information technology in the Healthcare Industry
    and the implementation of electronic medical records (EMR).

'
  :post: "Back in February of 2009 the [HITECH (Health Information Technology for
    Economic and Clinical Health)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/data-security-patient-engagement/)
    Act was passed as an element of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to
    fortify the privacy and safety of PHI by including provisions to the HIPAA Standards.
    Among the stipulations in HITECH was the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    which has requirements organized into three classifications, and within each classification
    are 18 standards and 36 implementation specifications that are categorized as
    “Required” or “Addressable”. The **Required** specifications are crucial and necessities
    to be implemented; whereas, **Addressable** specifications are meant for scalable
    consideration based on individual and entity needs and best practices. \n\n##
    The Three Classifications \n\n## 1. Administrative Safeguards\nThese constitute
    more than half of the HIPAA Security Assessment requirements. As with all three
    standards, compliance will mandate an evaluation of the security controls in place
    already, a precise and in-depth analysis, and a succession of documented solutions
    derived from a multitude of factors unique to each covered body.\n\nThese safeguards
    are broken down as follows:\n\n### Standard: Security Management Process\nThe
    intent is to create the administrative processes and operations that a covered
    body will utilize to enact the security program in its environment.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Risk Analysis (Required)\n2. Risk Management (Required)\n3.
    Sanction Policy (Required)\n4. Information System Activity Review (Required)\n\n###
    Standard: Assigned Security Responsibility\nThe goal is to recognize who will
    hold responsibility for ensuring that the covered body abides by the HIPAA Security
    Rule. There are no implementation standards for this standard.\n\n### Standard:
    Workforce Security\nThe objective is to identify each workforce member that necessitates
    access to ePHI and their need, time of need, and how they are going to control
    access to the information. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Authorization
    and/or Supervision (Addressable)\n2. Workforce Clearance Procedure (Addressable)\n3.
    Termination Procedures (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Information Access Management\nMeant
    to restrict access to solely persons with a need for specified ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Isolating Health Care Clearinghouse Functions (Required)\n2.
    Access Authorization (Addressable)\n3. Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable)\n\n###
    Standard: Security Awareness and Training\nTraining for all new and current members
    of the entity’s staff is mandated by the Security Rule.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Security Reminders (Addressable)\n2. Protection from Malicious
    Software (Addressable)\n3. Log-in Monitoring (Addressable)\n4. Password Monitoring
    (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Security Incident Procedures\nImplemented to call
    attention to security occurrences within the covered body’s environment. \n\n####
    Implementation Specifications\n1. Response and Reporting\n\n### Standard: Contingency
    Plan\nNecessitates to plan and establish strategies for retrieving access to ePHI
    if an entity where to experience a crisis or occurrence that disrupts urgent business
    operations.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Data Backup Plan (Required)\n2.
    Disaster Recovery Plan (Required)\n3. Emergency Mode Operation Plan (Required)\n4.
    Testing and Revision Procedures (Addressable)\n5. Applications and Data Criticality
    Analysis (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Evaluation\nRequires entities to create
    a process to review and maintain standard security measures to comply with The
    Security Rule. There are no implementation specifications for this standard.\n\n###
    Standard: Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements\nStates that covered
    bodies are required to sign a contract or other agreement that meet the definition
    of a “business associate.” This standard has no implementation specifications.\n\n##
    2. Physical Safeguards\nThese safeguards are meant to evaluate and implement all
    physical access to ePHI.\n\nThese are broken down as follows within a HIPAA Security
    Assessment:\n\n### Standard: Facility Access Controls\nEnacted to limit the access
    to the electronic information systems where ePHI is housed.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Contingency Operations (Addressable)\n2. Facility Security
    Plan (Addressable)\n3. Access Control and Validation Procedures (Addressable)\n4.
    Maintenance Records (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Workstation Use\nRequires that
    entities clarify the proper uses to be done by electronic computing devices. There
    are no implementation specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Workstation
    Security\nAddresses the operations and procedures for how workstations should
    be utilized and secured from unauthorized persons. There are no implementation
    specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Device and Media Controls\nThis
    covers the correct handling of electronic media including removal, receipt, backup,
    storage, reuse, disposal, and responsibility. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
    Disposal (Required)\n2. Media Re-Use (Required)\n3. Accountability (Addressable)\n4.
    Data Backup and Storage (Addressable)\n\n## 3. Technical Safeguards\nA covered
    body is mandated to determine the security protocol and specified technologies
    that are appropriate for implementing in its organization while complying with
    these safeguards which are broken down according to the HIPAA Security Assessment
    as follows:\n\n### Standard: Access Control\nRequired to provide/restrict persons
    with the access necessary for the information systems, applications, programs,
    or files associated with ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Unique
    User Identification (Required)\n2. Emergency Access Procedure (Required)\n3. Automatic
    Logoff (Addressable)\n4. Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)\n\n### Standard:
    Audit Controls\nThis standard is meant to be useful for the records and examinations
    of information system activity, particularly in a security violation.This standard
    has no implementation specifications.\n\n### Standard: Integrity\nThis standard
    requires that policies and processes are implemented to protect ePHI from being
    altered or destroyed.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Mechanism to Authenticate
    Electronic Protected Health Information(Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Person or
    Entity Authentication\nThis standard confirms that a person is who they are claiming
    to be before being granted the access to ePHI. This standard has no implementation
    specifications.\n\n### Standard: Transmission Security\nThis standard is utilized
    to guard against those who are not granted permissions to ePHI that is being communicated
    over electronic means.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Integrity Controls
    (Addressable)\n2. Encryption (Addressable)\n\nIn summary, when doing your own
    HIPAA Security Assessment, keep in mind that this applies to all media types including
    oral, paper, and electronic while simultaneously considering integrity, confidentiality,
    and availability. There are many HIPAA Security Assessment tools and services
    that have been released but no one is more highly regarded in this space than
    Datica as a [HIPAA compliance authority](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).

    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
