:summary: "$360,000! The cost for a maker of digital health products to design, implement,
  deploy and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own. Get the breakdown."
:blog_lead: "$360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health
  products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own.
  That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost of developing
  the technology for their own application. We often hear early-stage developers say
  they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using AWS. That’s when the steep education
  process begins to help them understand they’re just at the beginning of the compliance
  journey with AWS and there’s so much more to consider to build a compliant application
  in the cloud. "
:post: "## The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison \n\nOur
  goal in building the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) was to reduce
  the barriers to compliance in the cloud for makers of digital health products. As
  part of that ongoing commitment to simplify healthcare's onramp to the cloud, we
  provide as much value as possible in the form of healthcare expertise we share freely
  with the market. It is our goal to enable our customers to focus their efforts away
  from compliance and cloud management and toward developing digital health applications
  that improve patient outcomes. \n\nThere’s much to know about both compliance and
  cloud management and that knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education,
  personnel, and money. The intent of our newest guide, [The TCO of Compliance in
  the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/),
  is to help makers of digital health products make informed decisions about whether
  to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in the form of the Datica Platform.
  \n\n***Spoiler Alert:** It’s 10x more cost-effective to contract with Datica to
  deploy your application on a made-for-healthcare platform that includes not only
  the AWS cloud infrastructure, but also all the DevOps, DevSecOps, expertise, and
  proof necessary to build and market a healthcare application.* \n\nThis guide explains
  the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and offers a
  framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates for each of
  those considerations. We show how Datica addresses those requirements in some detail
  and how you as a customer benefit from building your application on the Datica Platform.
  These estimates are based on our extensive experience working with multiple third-party
  auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers (like [Amazon Web Services](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/),
  Microsoft Azure, or IBM Softlayer).\n\n## Datica's Shared Responsibility Model\n\nIt’s
  important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility model grants
  excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible
  for security IN the cloud. Orchestrating DevSecOps is just as challenging as orchestrating
  DevOps. The following diagram explains that a bit more, but get the full story by
  downloading the [complete guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/).

  :post: "![Old office](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2eMSsIeNu8YcUuOW6qkEYS/6980a750bcb5cf100747466b6cb69a7e/Datica_old_office.001.png?fm=jpg)\n*That's
    me in 2015, in the background of a photo in Datica's original office.* \n \n*Editor's
    note: As we roll out updates and changes to our new Kubernetes-based compliance
    platform our pricing is fluxuating and we're temporarily back to providing custom
    quotes based on specific configurations. Learn more about our [public product
    roadmap](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-were-building-daticas-public-product-roadmap/)
    and the exciting things happening at Datica* \n\nWe've done a lot of work since
    then, and we've now changed our opinion on the topic. We now offer up front Datica
    pricing right on the website: [https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/).
    I'd like to go through my old article and discussed what changed and why we now
    offer upfront pricing.\n\n1) \"First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead
    to buyer confusion.\" & 2) \"Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges
    comparisons with companies who weren’t direct competitors.\"\n \nRealistically,
    our largest competitors in the compliant cloud space aren’t other PaaS vendors
    but rather DIY solutions on one of the major IaaS vendors like Amazon or Azure.
    At the time, it was hard to communicate exactly what the total cost of ownership
    for build vs. buy would be, since we didn’t fully understand our costs as we were
    building infra at scale and going through our initial sets of audits. We've since
    written massive amounts of documentation on the subject: our [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    and [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) guides provide in depth details
    on effort and costs while our [open-sourced policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies)
    provide a detailed roadmap of what it takes to prove HITRUST certification if
    you were going to DIY.  If you work in a \"We build everything 100% here\" shop,
    you'll find the policies useful for your own build-outs. If you are looking to
    partner with a vendor, we now can provide you with the data to demonstrate that
    we provide the best value on the market.\n \n3) Third, we saw that often prospects
    weren’t entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose
    neither.\n \nDatica is the platform on which everything is built. Compliance is
    the top requirement for all digital health applications and it's where developers
    looking to build or move to the cloud need to begin. Something like integration
    is built on top of the platform, in a complementary fashion. We didn't know how
    to communicate this best in 2015 and we probably didn't help ourselves with mountain
    climbing analogies later that year with Redpoint and Stratum. We've figured out
    better ways to communicate that we want to be your one stop shop for all your
    tough challenges in building digital health products in the cloud — above hosting
    and interface engines.\n \n4) Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of
    the Lean Startup movement: We want to talk to people.\n \nDon't worry! We're still
    out talking to people. We just don't need to bake it into all pieces of the sales
    process if you aren't interested anymore. In fact, we used a lot of feedback and
    discussions from customers and prospects to build the [Digital Health Success
    Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/).\n \nWhile we made it easier to see our pricing
    and features, we still want to talk. It might be our midwestern roots, but we
    want to learn more about what you're working on and the challenges you're going
    through on your projects. We want to help, even if it means we send you along
    to someone else. Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/)!\n\n"

    The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around
    the topic of "cloud" within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between
    a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the
    cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress
    of digital health.'
  :post: |-
    Each quarter we will bring a similar report focused on a key topic related to healthcare technology. The shape of a report can take many forms. One quarter might be an extensive data study while another quarter might be an aggregation of industry views. Regardless of the style of report, the intent remains the same: Inform the digital health market with insights that can help them be successful. _There is no strategy without intelligence._

    Today we are happy to share our latest report titled [Public and Private Cloud Computing within Healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/public-vs-private-cloud-computing-within-healthcare-summer-2017/). The premise of this report is simple: the debate between Public vs. Private cloud models is ongoing, yet many digital health companies we speak with aren't exactly sure their definitions, nor which model might be a fit for them. The [cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/healthcare-cloud/) is expansive and complex. This report is meant to help breakdown the differences between the two, and source industry insights related to what is a good fit for healthcare.

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

    heaven. Developers can deploy application workloads to their Datica environment
    instead of directly to AWS to eliminate the burden of compliance. With the Datica
    Platform, you get all the great benefits of AWS as the foundation our platform,
    plus Datica automates all DevOps and DevSecOps requirements on the cloud. With
    AWS + Datica, developers can deploy AWS services & workloads in minutes that are
    fully in compliance with HIPAA and HITRUST. \n\nThis resource page is meant to

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica
    workflow diagram AWS](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3mxh8k3ZGwiUQce862ga2Q/1e86d891b61168f5f20c0814c8e74da0/Datica_workflow_diagram_AWS_2x.png)](https://assets.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4Qokvx5TskWwCWwGQk0wM/8304e9c351e19a1eb9eb8790f6d269a3/Datica_workflow_diagram.pdf)\n\nIf
    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
    [BAA from Datica](https://policy.datica.com/#23.-datica-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-(\"baa\")).
    \n\nAligning Business Associate Agreements amongst all technology partners is
    a full-time job. You sign one BAA with Datica to cover the entirety of compliance
    in the cloud, including AWS HIPAA compliance."
