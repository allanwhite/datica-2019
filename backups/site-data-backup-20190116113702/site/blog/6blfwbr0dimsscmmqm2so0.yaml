:post: "### HIPAA Requires Data Destruction of PHI\r\n\r\nIt does not. Nowhere in
  any of the HIPAA regulations or amendments is stated a single word in regards to
  data destruction, information size, or how/where PHI is to be liquidated. The vague
  directive that covered entities and business associates were given was to “prevent
  unauthorized access to PHI.” Many think that the Health Information Technology for
  Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) amendment added a data destruction clause,
  but it does not either. In retrospect, there is no need to be overly concerned with
  this technicality because although data destruction may not be listed as a requirement,
  it is required. Just like all other data protection laws, HIPAA is based on the
  reasonableness principle. Covered entities could never affirm that is was “reasonable”
  to jettison PHI without properly destroying it to prevent unauthorized access. So
  to say that HIPAA requires data destruction would not be accurate; it is more suitable
  to say HIPAA necessitates prevention of unauthorized access to PHI, which results
  in data destruction. \r\n\r\n### Providers Will Send Data to Me Even if I’m Not
  HIPPA Compliant\r\n\r\nFALSE! If you are not HIPAA compliant, healthcare providers
  are prohibited by law to refer patients to you. They are also interdicted to discuss
  patients without specific authorization. This will have a negative impact on your
  business and being viewed as a trusted partner in the healthcare industry. With
  the growing severity in repercussions from HIPAA breaches, no one wants to be involved
  with an entity that is non-compliant. \r\n\r\n### My Organization Doesn’t Need a
  Privacy Officer\r\n\r\nIt is [clearly stated](https://hipaa.catalyze.io/#assigned-security-responsibility---164-308a2)
  in HIPAA law that inaugurating a privacy officer is required and necessary to safeguard
  your patients’ PHI. You will want to find a proficient officer that is familiar
  with HIPAA but also knows your workplace operations and processes. They will need
  to be literate in HIPAA’s privacy requirements as well as state laws. The proper
  background for a compliance officer will be in managing health records, IT security,
  general compliance, clinical care, and risk management/analysis. \r\n\r\nIn the
  complicated world that is HIPAA, misconceptions run rampant as it is easy for professionals
  to misconstrue regulations when no clear directives are given upfront. So just like
  folklore about the Loch Ness Monster or Big Foot, these myths become socially assumed
  but still completely erroneous. \r\n\r\nCheck back on our [Blog](https://catalyze.io/blog)
