  about Business Associate Agreements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/):**
  \nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA
  and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main
  categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs), and business associates.
  The further down the line the subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more
  confusion there is about who really is a business associate and who needs to sign
  a business associate agreement.\n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)*\n\n**[2017
  Healthcare Trends Part 1: The Rise of Patient as Consumer](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/):**
  \nThere’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed by
  a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before in
  a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and often
  wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently. Over the
  course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that follow the
  broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching
  trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of
  the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and
  new problems.  \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/)*\n\n**[2017
  Healthcare Trends Part 3: The Rise and Fall of the EHR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/):**
  \nThis 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs,
  raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful
  Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs. In
  fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained and
  overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been at
  the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to record
  keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits to
  EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.  \n*[Continue

  Data Breaches, and the HIPAA Conduit Exemption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/):**
  \nBy now you’ve likely heard of the CloudFlare parser bug that caused CloudFlare’s
  CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you
  ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event. \n\nAt
  Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate
  to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application?
  If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of? As
  it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly
  to these questions. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/)*\n\n**[FHIR
  is no Longer Just a Concept](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/):**
  \nI recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at the 2nd HL7
  FHIR Applications Roundtable. This topped my must-attend 2017 events list after
  I attended the first event last fall in Boston. Here’s what I learned, saw, and
  enjoyed at the applications roundtable. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)*\n\n**[SaaS,
  PaaS, IaaS—What’s the Difference?](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/):**
  \nIn a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital health,
  including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered was
  that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped to SaaS
  any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies are
  turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing complexities.
  \ \n\nIn 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within the next year
  — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought it a good time
  to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent in healthcare companies
  today. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/)*\n\n**[The
  Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/):**
  \nI saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?”
  that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
  place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at last
  year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center environment
  and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry is notoriously
  the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race to the cloud
  has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious. Even so,
  the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health systems
  today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
  from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020. \n\nIn this article, we explore
  the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing
  in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/)*\n\n**[Announcing
  One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/):**
  \nToday we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with
  Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem
  of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament
  to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way
  possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
  from three years of learning. \n\nWe aim to empower the developer community to solve
  the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
  and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need more
  flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing at
  scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner
  Code. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)*\n\n**[5
  Steps to HITRUST Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/):**
  \n“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST
  CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive
  beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point
  person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis Good,
  Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica. \n\nComplying with HIPAA and
  proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you
  to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA
  rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way
  to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we have at Datica.
  Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA
  compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for
  our customers. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)*\n\n**[Opportunities
  for Digital Health Vendors in the Pharmaceutical Industry](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/):**
  \nNaomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation
  and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as
  Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships,
  she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare
  professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the
  molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers.
  In our July, 2017 podcast \n\nDr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in
  a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems
  innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working
  with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/)*\n"

    of shadow IT in healthcare. Is it a security threat or enabler for innovation? '
  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

    Panel Recap Highlights \n\n### Q1. Does the business model of a digital health
    product factor as the biggest reason of later failure or success?\n\n**Carolyn
    Jasik:** \"You actually have to be selling something that people want to buy.
    This seems so obvious but so many companies miss this. Digital health vendors
    need to understand how health systems get paid.\"\n\n**Kristi Ebong:** \"It’s
    also all about the team. Can they engage across the health system to identify
    the complexities to really understand the business model? Team is the most opportunity.\"\n\n###
    Q2. How can health systems or payers help digital health succeed? Follow up: which
    stakeholders need early engagement and for what needs?\n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:**
    \"Having someone on the inside of the health system to help navigate the complexity
    is very important to success.\"\n\n**Kristi Ebong:** \"In general, the cosponsors
    are legal and technology. Having that combined insight is critical to knowing
    which stakeholders need to come to the engagement. You must have legal buy-in
    to help drive commercialization focus, plus technology buy-in to know how it will
    integrate.\"\n\n**Christiana DellaRusso:** \"You’ve seen one health system, you’ve
    seen one health system. There may be patterns, but legal, infrastructure, culture
    are all different for every organization.\" \n\n**Carolyn Jasik:** \"A lot of
    digital health companies don’t recruit people with hospital experience. Each health
    system will tell you that they need a product to be customized to them. You need
    a smart team on the digital health side of things to really know what’s scalable.
    Digital health vendors need the maturity to push back and say 'no, we’re going
    to do it this way.'\"\n\n### Q3. How important are pilots to the success of a
    digital health product? Follow up: What are the common misunderstandings about
    pilots?\n \n**Carolyn Jasik:** \"You first have to know what the goal of the pilot
    is; is it a feasibility pilot or a business opportunity pilot? There are different
    sets of people to work with for each kind, so first know what you’re doing.\"\n\n**Christiana
    DelloRusso:** \"Understand what’s going to be required for scale. Where are the
    resources and budget going to come from and who are the stakeholders and owners
    of the budget? Get as much of that figured out upfront—before the pilot—to get
    a good assessment of success.\"\n\n\n### Q4. Which digital health success stories
    can you share that might provide insight into the differentiators that enable
    that success? \n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:** \"The companies that are doing well
    are the ones that are solving a basic need for health systems. [InDemand Interpreting](https://www.indemandinterpreting.com/)
    is a great example. Their on demand, remote video a-la-cart service is solving
    a solid need that won’t change over time and they are growing solidly.\" \n\n**Kristi
    Ebong:** \"[Well's messaging application](https://wellapp.com/) was in our first
    accelerator program. They have now scaled to 80+ clinics. They solved the pain
    point of physicians not wanting to talk to or message patients directly — it’s
    not that they don’t care, but that they are busy.\"\n\n**Carolyn Jasik:** \"[Voalte](https://www.voalte.com/).
    Their team communication system solves an important problem within a hospital.
    What’s innovative about it is that it puts a device in the hand of every caregiver
    and gives them the ability to message on the spot.\"\n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:**
    \"In thinking about disrupting healthcare, one thing that helps people get perspective
    is to understand that change is relentlessly iterative. You need to understand
    where they need to go, but look at where health systems are right now. The latest
    and greatest disruption is not likely to be feasible for most hospitals... It
    all comes down to understanding that healthcare doesn’t get paid to do the right
    thing.\""

  :summary: 'Day 3 of re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing Fargate
    among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we''re excited about Fargate?

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
    dir=\"ltr\">No longer any need to manage servers and clusters for your containers
    - AWS Fargate - Run ECS and EKS without managing servers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reInvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reInvent</a>
    <a href=\"https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL\">https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lZnS558CXV\">pic.twitter.com/lZnS558CXV</a></p>&mdash;
    AWS re:Invent (@AWSreInvent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/935910336212844544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November
    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"
