:blog_lead: "> Interoperability may not have gotten enough attention in the early
  days of Meaningful Use’s electronic health records (EHR) gold rush, but it’s now
  taking center stage as healthcare providers, government agencies, vendors, and committees
  consider how to support the exchange of data easily and securely. People underestimate
  how challenging this work is. Vendors are being cautious before spending lots of
  research and development money before a standard is more clearly defined. - [Alison

:post: "Last month on October 02, 2015 at the KLAS Keystone Summit in Midway, Utah,
  the top EHR vendor and provider executives and stakeholders gathered by consensus
  in an attempt to bring objectivity to the metrics of interoperability. Along with
  collaboration efforts from informatics specialists and provider organizations, the
  following twelve corporations were involved:\n\n1. Allscripts (Assaf Halevy, VP
  of business development, solutions management)\n2. athenahealth (Jonathan Bush,
  CEO)\n3. Cerner (Zane Burke, president)\n4. eClinicalWorks (Girish Kumar, CEO)\n5.

  VP of product)\n12. NextGen Healthcare (Rusty Frantz, president and CEO)\n\nRegardless
  of the $31.5 billion investment from federal funds, it is clear that there are still
  critical gaps in the interoperability endeavors of EHRs. It is because of this that
  these leaders gathered to propose new reports with a basis from their own internal
  IT systems and interoperability efforts. The data that will be included has been
  classified as either “hard” or “soft” data. Hard data may be how these systems have
  achieved interoperability with vendors, whereas soft data could be measuring the
  responsiveness of the vendor. \n\nOnce these reports become finalized, they will
  be presented to the policymakers to show the market’s continued progress and further
  attempts to standardize how healthcare systems communicate. With the vision of true
  interoperability in healthcare on the horizon, the rest of us are on the edge of
  our seats with anticipation to see these finalized metrics as this standard becomes
  more clearly defined. \n\nWhat do you think goes into measuring interoperability?

    aren’t preparing for patient engagement.

'
  :post: "I like to ask people from health systems, most of them from the IT side,
    about their patient engagement or digital engagement strategy. It’s interesting
    to hear how systems think about digital engagement considering the buzz and hype
    it is getting from vendors and pundits.\n\nMy unscientific opinion is that very
    few systems have anything resembling a patient engagement strategy. Despite getting
    so much attention, most healthcare delivery organizations aren’t preparing for
    patient engagement.\n\nA typical conversation I have with somebody in an IT group
    goes a bit like this:\n\n**Me:** “How are you thinking about patient engagement
    tools and strategies, either in place today or planned for the future?”\n\n**Response:**
    “MyChart is our patient engagement tool.” (or some variation of that statement)
    \n\n**Me:** “Are you using other mobile apps or technologies to connect with patients
    for communication, education, or self management?”\n\n**Response:** “Well, there
    have been a couple of small initiatives. For the most part, we use MyChart.” \n\n**Me:**
    “How do patients use MyChart?”\n\nWe now live in such an Epic-centric world that
    Epic is synonymous with EHR and MyChart is synonymous with PHR. More surprisingly
    to me is that MyChart is also now synonymous with patient engagement.\n\nThe systems
    I’m talking to are larger systems, so it’s not surprising to see Epic. I’ve had
    similar conversations with non-Epic systems and those usually just conclude with,
    “We’ve tried a couple of things for patients, but nothing at scale.”\n\nMy sense
    is that the root of the problem with patient engagement has two parts. The first
    problem is the lack of definition around patient engagement. There have been efforts
    to *define and standardize patient engagement*, but I don’t know many systems
    that have adopted a framework around it. Lack of definition makes it hard to create
    and implement a strategy.\n\nThe second problem is that most systems, especially
    IT groups within those systems, are drowning in other projects such as EHR implementations.
    For health systems, patient engagement still has an unclear ROI. With limited
    resources (“our group is fully booked for the next 12 to 18 months”), it’s hard
    to justify assigning labor and capital to projects that won’t deliver immediate
    value.\n\nI was telling a friend (and former Epic employee) about what I’ve been
    seeing with patient engagement, specifically MyChart. His response was, “Give
    them two years. When they see the timelines for some of the desired features,
    they’ll be out of the honeymoon phase and be looking for new ways to do things”.\n\nThat
    might be the case, but there are systems outside the honeymoon phase implementing
    Epic or other EHR. I’m curious what, if anything, those systems are doing with
    patient engagement.\n\nLacking definition and clear ROI, using the PHR solution
    of Epic or other EHR vendor for patient engagement makes sense. Looking at patient
    engagement broadly and defining it as people being more actively involved in their
    health and wellness, an EHR vendor won’t succeed in building a “one size fits
    all” solution.\n\nThis is not a knock against the EHR vendors or a reference to
    the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of their products. I just don’t think one
    solution, built by any organization or developer, will ever have the flexibility
    and features needed to meet the hype of patient engagement. MyChart and other
    provider-based PHRs are a stopgap solution that have a lot of adoption because
    they are bundled with EHRs.\n\nWhere does that leave all of the developers and
    startups that are building technology to engage patients? One of the major challenges
    for them is overcoming the stopgap PHR objections from enterprises. They can certainly
    go directly to consumers, and many of them are. The data silos opening up are
    helping those engagement startups populate their apps without having to rely on
    manual entry. \n\nIt’s easier to get patients to adopt something when the provider
    and health system buy in. That’s why MyChart is the most popular PHR. But is MyChart
    what people want, or rather is it what people get?\n"

  :summary: HHS released its official Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing last month.
    The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask.
  :blog_lead: |-
    HHS released it's official [Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing][1] last month. The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask. In some ways, it's HHS playing catchup to the industry. The cloud, while still early in terms of adoption in healthcare, is already heavily used for creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting ePHI. Look no further than [athenahealth][2], one of the largest EHR providers, for an example of a lot of ePHI in the cloud. Storing or moving data around different cloud-based services is becoming more and more commonplace.

  :post: |
    > A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity. - Dalai Lama

    Personally, I think HHS could and should play a more active and significant role in trends like cloud computing. I acknowledge it's hard to keep up with pace of technology in healthcare but there's still more HHS could do to engage with those leading these technical charges. That said, it's good to have official guidance from HHS.

    Yesterday I jointly conducted a webinar with [Coalfire][3]. Today I will recap some of the highlights, and pull out the salient points from the guidance and summarized them below. (_Note: CSP stands for cloud service provider._)

    * **Lacking encryption keys doesn't prevent you from being liable under HIPAA.** From the guidance, _This is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules._ This has been a claim by some CSPs and this is one of the most clear and relevant aspects of the HHS guidance. The claim by some CSPs is that, by not having the keys to decrypt ePHI, they are not a subcontractor or business associate. HHS says they are because they still store receive and maintain, even if that ePHI is encrypted and the CSP does not have the key to decrypt it. CSPs that fall into this bucket at considered _no-view services_ by HSS.
    * **But lacking keys does change obligations.** From the guidance, _In particular, where only the customer controls who is able to view the ePHI maintained by the CSP, certain access controls, such as authentication or unique user identification, may be the responsibility of the customer, while others, such as encryption, may be the responsibility of the CSP business associate._ This is the first I've seen HHS acknowledge—implicitly, at least—the concept of compliance inheritance for HIPAA. At Datica, we [pioneered][4] the concept of inheritance and still feel strongly that compliance inheritance is the best path to securing data, reducing risk of breach, and complying with HIPAA, in a cloud-based world.
    * **Lacking keys it could change breach reporting.** From the guidance, _If the ePHI that has been breached is encrypted consistent with the HIPAA standards set forth in 45 CFR § 164.402(2) and HHS' Guidance [13](#) the incident falls within the breach "safe harbor" and the CSP business associate is not required to report the incident to its customer._ This is significant as it changes breach reporting requirements for no-view CSPs, and breach reporting is a big part of HIPAA and a big part of what covered entities want to understand about their business associates and partners.
    * **All types of cloud configurations are ok for HIPAA.** From the guidance, _…while a covered entity or business associate may use cloud-based services of any configuration (public, hybrid, private, etc.), [3](#) provided it enters into a BAA with the CSP, the type of cloud configuration to be used may affect the risk analysis and risk management plans of all parties and the resultant provisions of the BAA._ NIST [defines][5] different cloud deployment models. The most common are public and private, or some mix of those two that NIST defines as hybrid. Organizations can comply with HIPAA using any deployment model but there are different risks associated with each and it is the job of the covered entity and business associate to properly assess the risk when selecting the proper deployment model. I would have preferred HHS go further and call out [single-tenant and multi-tenant in regards to HIPAA and cloud][6].
    * **SLAs need to align with BAAs.** From the guidance, _If a covered entity or business associate enters into a SLA with a CSP, it should ensure that the terms of the SLA are consistent with the BAA and the HIPAA Rules._ This is something that many business associates don't do but should. The core of this guidance is that the SLA from a CSP should ensure that access to ePHI is not restricted due to excessive downtime.
    * **Security and breach reporting should be very specifically defined.** From the guidance, _The Security Rule, however, is flexible and does not prescribe the level of detail, frequency, or format of reports of security incidents, which may be worked out between the parties to the business associate agreement (BAA)._ With ePHI moving between CSPs (think APIs and [Blank-as-a-Service][7]), it's imperative that each party knows what it is responsible for reporting. Reporting is essential to investigating and shutting off breaches.
    * **Cloud service providers do not need to store ePHI for some period of time.** From the guidance, _No, the HIPAA Rules generally do not require a business associate to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI) beyond the time it provides services to a covered entity or business associate._ This [not news][8] to us but it something that is frequently misunderstood about HIPAA so it's good that HHS called this out for CSPs.
    * **It's ok to use servers outside the USA.** From the guidance, _Yes, provided the covered entity (or business associate) enters into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the CSP and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules._ This surprised me a little. Not because I don't agree with HHS but because I have a hard time imagining the use case for this. We have global customers, particularly in the life sciences arena, who need global deployments. In those cases, we deploy separate apps and databases across different regions depending on where end users reside. All customers we have that work with US citizens are deployed in US data centers.
    * **Documentation of security practices is not required from cloud service providers.** From the guidance, _The HIPAA Rules do not expressly require that a CSP provide documentation of its security practices to or otherwise allow a customer to audit its security practices._ This type of documentation, while not required, may still be needed by covered entities and business associates based on the their determination of risk.

    ## What was not in the guidance?

    I think a few things were missing and that HHS didn't go far enough.

    1. **Define compliance inheritance.** I think HHS could go further here. HITRUST is a [good example][9] by incorporating the concept of inheritance into the CSF. Inheriting aspects of HIPAA is a core part of cloud deployments and should be addressed by HHS.
    2. **Address questions about multi-tenancy.** This is probably the most frequent question when it comes to ePHI + cloud. It would have been good to have official guidance as a part of the cloud guidance from HHS.
    3. **Start moving towards a universal, readable BAA.** The BAA [template][10] that HSS has on it's site, while useful in its generalizability, is too broad. There are things we know about the cloud and one of them, related to inheritance above, is that different parties can own different obligations. Creating a universal BAA, even if HHS is just the convener of industry leaders, would go a long way to helping healthcare move to the cloud in a safe way.

    Healthcare, and it's data and applications, are slowly but surely embracing the cloud. The recent guidance from HHS has gotten a lot of attention. Hopefully this summary was helpful. If you have any other questions, reach out to us at [hello@datica.com][11].

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
