:summary: 'As demonstrated in many ways here at Datica, there is a clear ROI with
  leveraging HITRUST as your anchoring compliance framework. '
:blog_lead: 'At Datica, we’ve written extensively about the [cost of HITRUST](https://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification).
  The truth is, it’s an expensive process — not just the first time you do it but
  on an ongoing basis. To maintain a HITRUST Certification takes a lot of people hours
  and [real dollars for 3rd party assessors](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/)
  and to HITRUST itself. That said, there is a [clear ROI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-truth-about-hitrust-and-why-it-should-become-the-industry-standard/)
  with leveraging HITRUST as your anchoring compliance framework.

'
:post: "\nIn the past, we have only considered the external ROI of HITRUST which,
  for Datica at least, meant differentiation in the market, speed to close and implement
  new deals, and a general trust factor that would typically be reserved for larger
  organizations. A recurring topic of discussion at the HITRUST conference last month
  was the different forms of ROI for HITRUST, with internal ROI being discussed at
  length by many organizations, large and small. I quickly came to realize that the
  ROI for HITRUST is just as much internal as it is external. \n\nLet me explain in
  the context of Datica.\n\nAt Datica, we built our initial compliance program, from
  policies through implementation (link to academy post on maturity model), for healthcare
  and specifically to meet HITRUST CSF controls. This was five years ago. We’ve since
  leveraged the HITRUST CSF for [SOC2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/soc-2-type-ii-compliance-for-cloud-computing/)
  and most recently [GDPR assessments](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/gdpr-compliance/).
  As the HITRUST CSF has matured, our compliance posture has matured along with it.
  And the entire process of working with HITRUST has shaped all of our internal activities,
  from product to marketing and sales.\n\nTo fully appreciate the internal ROI we
  get from HITRUST, the example of our new product design and development serves to
  highlight how HITRUST permeates all areas of Datica. We decided in 2017 to develop
  a [new product based on Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
  We did this because the market was increasingly interested in Kubernetes and the
  offerings from cloud providers like AWS were not covered under a BAA (currently
  none of the major Kubernetes services available are HITRUST Certified except for
  Datica’s). In developing our Kubernetes roadmap, we started with a list of HITRUST
  controls we had to meet to comply with our policies and certifications. We then
  used this set of controls to ensure we implemented the proper technology around
  Kubernetes — networking, backup, IDS, container security, certificates, etc. The
  product requirements, based on HITRUST, were unambiguous to our product and engineering
  teams, and it was a light lift for our security and compliance people to sign off.\n\nEven
  our sales and marketing people leverage the HITRUST maturity model to differentiate
  our products from our competitors in the market.\n\nOther examples are the recent
  free guides we published on how to secure common managed cloud databases to comply
  with HITRUST. The specific HITRUST controls are listed with each step. Here is the
  [AWS RDS guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/).\n\nHITRUST
  trickles down to all people at Datica. It takes away the subjective “the security
  officer says this,” and instead provides a published set of controls. This is hard
  to quantify with a dollar value but [it is a significant ROI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/).
  What is interesting is that these examples, and this theme, were repeated time and
  time again at the [HITRUST conference](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-2018-a-fantastic-event/).
  \n\nLooking forward, we are aligning our internal compliance structure and compliance
  operations even more around HITRUST. We are currently in the process of re-writing
  our policies and procedures (look for an announcement with new open source tools
  soon) and we are doing it with each compliance action and activity mapped to specific
  HITRUST controls. We are doing this to give us a constant set of guardrails and
  to ease the burden, both to us and our assessors, of our annual HITRUST assessments.

  :blog_lead: The HITRUST Conference in 2018 was different. Not evolutionarily different
    from previous years, but drastically different. And in good ways. Everything,
    from the venue to the sessions to the attendees, was impressive. HITRUST did a
    great job updating this conference into a fantastic event.
  :post: |2

    ## HITRUST 2018 was all about the cloud

    In terms of the content, the major change was the focus on cloud. We’ve been attending the conference for four years and I feel like Datica (Catalyze at the time) was the only organization talking about the cloud at the HITRUST conference four years ago. Almost every session I attended this year was focused on the cloud or had the cloud as the underlying context for the session. This reflects the broader shift in the market but is well timed for HITRUST as most attendees were beginning their journeys to the cloud and doing it with HITRUST as the anchoring framework for that journey.

    ## New HITRUST Shared Responsibility Program

    Along those same lines, HITRUST is working hard to embrace the cloud and announced its [Shared Responsibility Program]( https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-program-addresses-security-risks-inefficiencies-leveraging-cloud-service-providers/) this week to coincide with the conference. Shared Responsibility is tied directly to compliance on the cloud as vendors work with CSPs, SaaS vendors, and other cloud platform companies offering solutions for various aspects of infrastructure. It is good to see HITRUST pushing this forward by offering a Shared Responsibility Program that I hope will extend and add value to the [shared responsibility models](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) currently in existence from cloud vendors.

    The sessions themselves, both the breakout and the main room sessions, were well thought out and the speakers I saw were good. Most of the speakers had real-world experience with the topics they were discussing, something I don’t always see at conferences. Engagement from attendees was good as well; most sessions had a healthy amount of interaction between speakers and the audience.

    ## Smaller organizations were featured

    One thing I particularly appreciated about the event was the sessions that involved smaller organizations. Four years ago, the speakers I remember were either from HITRUST or from large payors. This year’s event featured many speakers from smaller entities, [Datica included](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/events/hitrust-2018/). This reflects the goal of HITRUST to engage the smaller end of the market, from startups to growth stage vendors, looking to anchor on a compliance framework, which is smart because the agility of smaller organizations means that is where a lot of innovation is currently found. I think educating vendors is the best way to get them to adopt HITRUST and to ultimately help HITRUST become a de-facto standard across both sides of the market—large enterprises and their vendors or partners.

    ## The Complete Cloud Compliance book was introduced

    <img class="lozad float-right" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=400" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=200&q=20" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance" width="200" />

    On a personal note, we launched our book [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com/) this week and were offering free, and sometimes signed, copies for conference attendees. Underscoring the theme of cloud this week, the response to the book was huge. We underestimated demand for the book and had to overnight additional copies to ensure we had some for the final day of the conference. We are now out of books, but will have more in the coming weeks. [Sign up to get a download of chapter 2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/) of the book now, and to be notified when general purchase is available on Amazon.com.

    ## Best practices are best practices

    Compliance is global, however, with highly regulated industries spanning many geographies. The requirements to meet [GDPR regulations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/) by May 25th pushed us to examine a compliance posture that was international instead of HIPAA specific.

    The nearly year-long exercise was a catalyst for our compliance team to innovate on how we could be bigger than just GDPR. We took a look at compliance holistically, and globally, to come up with a strategy that will allow us to better serve customers across industries and geographies.

    The result is simplified with a phrase we use internally: _Best Practices are Best Practices_.

    ## The Datica global compliance roadmap

    Datica's ability to serve international compliance regimes stems from a philosophy exemplified by [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/): one framework, many regimes. We decided to take a single compliance framework, make it our root attestation, and then plan to use it as a repeatable mapping process towards other regimes. HITRUST and its Common Security Framework was clearly the answer.

    HITRUST has done a great job of aiming for big goals. With version 9.1 of the CSF, we believe there are few better options for the most stringent and comprehensive compliance auditing framework on the cloud. The HITRUST CSF is our DNA framework.

    By using HITRUST, we will crosswalk the CSF to other geographies and compliance regimes, thus accelerating our ability to support compliance attestations in those areas. Certainly unique considerations will exist in respective geographies before we can officially support compliant deployments of the Datica Platform in a country, but the CSF will get us almost all the way there in all cases.

    As has been the drumbeat since [Datica's founding in 2013](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/), transparency is the key to distilling the complexity of compliance. Transparency is how we best help healthcare — and other regulated industries — move forward. To communicate our global compliance posture to both present and future customers, we built a handy table that documents our compliance roadmap.

    <img class="lozad group" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=600" data-srcset="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=800 1000w, //images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png 1200w" alt="global compliance stance table" />

    The table is simple:

    * We list geographies and certain regimes that matter in those geographies.
    * One column states if that regime is currently supported by the platform.
    * Another column states if we have plans to support it someday.
    * And lastly, for those we plan to support, we give a broad estimation to when the HITRUST crosswalk will be done along with any additional specific requirements for the respective regime.

    This table will be updated a lot throughout 2018 as we test our compliance posture against new regimes.

    We invite you to take a look at public global compliance roadmap by visiting the [Global Compliance Posture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/cloud-compliance/global/) page of our website.

    In short, we plan to take HITRUST global to both geographies and regimes that we haven't previously supported. We want to be the best compliance management option for cloud native applications across the world.

    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),

    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
