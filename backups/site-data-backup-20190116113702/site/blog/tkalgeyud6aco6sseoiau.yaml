:summary: The most critical issue the healthcare industry is seeing when it comes
  to patient engagement is altering the perspectives and suppositions of patients
  and clinicians. Many believe that patient portals are the end-all solution for patient
  engagement by simply satisfying Meaningful Use requirements, but what many fail
  to understand is that patient engagement is not simply technological advancements;
  it is a complete culture change.

:post: "As clinical practices face the gap between readily available resources and
  accessibly affordable technology, vendors can bridge this space by adopting a patient-centric
  mindset. Patients want many features and tools at hand, but for practices to take
  full advantage of these, they need to be part of a larger platform that has integration
  capabilities with other technologies.\n\nHere are three considerations every vendor
  in healthcare should know to really hone in on how they can enforce the message
  of patient engagement.\n\n### 1) There are many tools that can be utilized to interact
  with a patient at every single stage of treatment.\n\n-  Reminders\n-  Push Notifications\n-
  \ Emails\n-  Texts\n-  Online clinician scheduling \n-  Online search capabilities\n-
  \ Transparent billing\n\n### 2) Utilize other channels of communication for patient-physician
  interaction.\n\n-  Newsletters\n-  Blogs\n-  Mailers\n-  Social Media\n\n### 3)
  Patient Portals are under utilized and are failing to truly engage patients.\n\nAs
  a vendor, make the features you are offering capable of simple integration into
  a healthcare network to really emphasize the value of your products. Studies show
  that under 10 percent of patients take advantage of the patient portal so be part
  of the solution that raises that statistic.\n\nDatica, as a vendor to many healthcare
  systems, has aided on the internal side to help deploy several tools that enhance
  patient engagement. You can read about our success story with the Department of
  Veterans Affairs in our new [case study](/customer/veterans-affairs/) to really
  get an understanding of how vendors have such a heavy impact on the patient experience.\n\n"
