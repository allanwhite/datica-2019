:summary: So what's in store for digital health over the next 12 months? Let's take
  a look into the crystal ball.
:blog_lead: 'Welcome to 2014! 2013 was another big year for digital health on all
  fronts. While widespread disruption didn''t happened in healthcare in 2013, we did
  see lots of great progress on technology and business fronts, and we''re starting
  to see more concrete evidence around new and emerging models of care, many of which
  rely highly on new, modern technologies. It takes time for change to take hold in
  an industry as large as healthcare, but talking to people inside and outside of
  the industry gives us the sense that we''re past the tipping point.

'
:post: "For a look back at 2013, check out this post on digital health trends in 2013
  and this great Rock Health [deck](http://www.slideshare.net/RockHealth/digital-health-funding-2013-year-in-review-by-rockhealth)
  on funding trends in 2013.\r\n\r\nWe saw lots of attention on health technology
  in 2013 with the [debacle](http://histalkmobile.com/the-train-wreck-known-as-healthcare-gov/)
  that was the launch of Healthcare.gov. The media has taken the problems at launch
  and run with them, and health reform in general is taking a hit from this very public
  misstep. Look for this story, and the related launch of health insurance exchanges
  by states, to continue to unfold in 2014. So the mass media attention on health
  IT will continue.\r\n\r\nAnd Meaningful Use continues with the rollout of Stage
  2 and 3 over the next several years. Stage 2 and 3 are much more focused on patient
  access to data and eventually patient access to self management tools. This means
  that collectively health organizations, through existing and emerging health IT
  vendors, are going to need to spend a lot more time and effort thinking about the
  patient. Patient engagement is a tough nut to crack, but it's basically required
  for Meaningful Use, so it's a great bucket to bet on.\r\n\r\nSo what's in store
  for digital health over the next 12 months? Let's take a look into the crystal ball.
  I'll dedicate a blog post to each of these specific trends. Look for the rest over
  the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n- Apps Changing to Platforms\r\n- More of a Focus on
  Niche Offerings\r\n- Bigger Leaps to the Cloud\r\n- Meaningful Use Continues to
  Challenge IT Departments\r\n- One Size Does Not Fit All (multi-platform support)\r\n-
  Patient First, Patient Centered\r\n- Distribution is King\r\n- Epic Continues to
  Rule the Roost\r\n- Expanded View of A Person / Patient / Consumer\r\n- APIs and
  Big Data\r\n- Many More Mobile Health Device Extenders (DIY Health)\r\n\r\nNo matter
  how you slice it, it's a very exciting time to be in digital health, and it's a
  very excited time to be in healthcare generally with all of the changes coming to
  the system. It's an industry we've lived in for many years and we're more excited
  today than we've ever been before about the prospects for change coming to healthcare,
  changes that are powered or augmented by new technology.\r\n\r\n"
