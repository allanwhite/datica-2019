:summary: To address compliance challenges in mobile messaging, we’re very excited
  to announce HIPAAGRAM, a free, open source, HIPAA compliant mobile messaging app.
:blog_lead: "> Mobile is eating the world. - Benedict Evans\n"
:post: "We often write about [healthcare trends][1], healthcare technology, healthcare
  data, and healthcare innovation. Some trends are more hype than maturity. This is
  in large part because healthcare, despite recent transformational accelerations
  driven by government intervention, moves slowly and requires time to change course.
  Some trends, however, are being fully realized today by necessity. One realization
  of trends in healthcare is the requirement for secure mobile messaging. Mobile messaging
  is being driven to adoption in healthcare by what seems like a perfect storm of
  trends.\n\n## 1. Clinicians are mobile.\n\nHave you ever spent a day with a clinician
  (nurse, doctor, MA, etc)? My only advice is to wear good shoes. I’m still shocked
  by the pace in which clinicians—even the ones with legs much smaller than mine—walk.
  They are constantly on the go, moving from room to room, building to building, floor
  to floor, and even site to site. They bounce between patients, administrators, other
  clinicians, conferences, and families. Clinicians need access to data and resources
  [on the go][2].\n\n## 2. Care is team-based.\n\nClinical medicine has become increasingly
  specialized and  largely shift-based. Caring for patients now, more than ever, is
  a team sport.  Whether it’s to curbside a specialist about a finding or test result
  or to more effectively handoff patients at the end of a shift, clinicians need to
  work more together to care for patients. Atul Guwande put it better than I can in
  his fantastic [New Yorker piece][3] about physicians as pit crew people. Clinicians
  need better ways to collaborate on patient care.\n\n## 3. Clinicians and patients
  overwhelmingly use smartphones.\n\nThe [Pew Research][4] has a treasures trove of
  data on mobile adoption and [Epocrates][5] specifically has great data on clinician
  use of mobile devices. It’s not just young physicians and patients that have and
  use smartphones. If my wife’s 84 yr old Greek Yia Yia can text pictures of a rash
  to my wife for a consult, then patients are ready to use phones to interact with
  providers.\n\n## 4. The business model is shifting from volume to value.\n\nIncreasingly,
  through new payment models like bundled payments, accountable / captivated care,
  and even trends towards subscription-based medicine, healthcare providers and organizations
  are being compensated based on the overall value of care they deliver to patients,
  not simply the volume of care. Delivering value in care requires more than 10 minute
  appointment slots. It requires more touch points between providers, patients, and
  even administrators.\n\n## 5. Engaging patients in care.\n\nTied to several of the
  trends above, patient engagement is [major priority][6] for most health systems.
  Healthcare can learn from [trends in other industries][7] that clearly show increased
  engagement of consumers through the use of mobile tools - both messaging and apps.\n\nDespite
  those trends, and the compelling case for mobile messaging in healthcare, there
  are challenges that remain for adoption. Some challenges are harder to overcome
  - like answering questions around where mobile messaging fits into clinical workflow
  between providers and patients. These workflow challenges need to be overcome within
  an organization.\n\n## Why we created—and open-sourced—HIPAAGRAM\n\nOther challenges
  exist in the form of concerns about security and compliance when it comes to mobile
  messaging. To address those challenges, we’re very excited to announce [HIPAAGRAM][8],
  a free, open source, HIPAA compliant mobile messaging solution.\n\nHIPAAGRAM, initially
  available on iOS, is a mobile app with all data stored on Datica. Datica is HIPAA
  compliant and [HITRUST CSF Certified][10], so you can rest assured the data is in
  good hands.\n\nOne of the exciting things about HIPAAGRAM is that it’s open source
  and can be customized however you’d like. If you do customize the app, we’d love
  it if would consider open sourcing your changes and we’ll publicize them so others
  can benefit. Better yet, if you want to build a version for Android or Web we’d
  be happy to do a post about it.\n\nEverything you need to know about getting HIPAAGRAM
  setup is on the [site][11]. If you have questions that aren’t answered on the site,
  please don’t hesitate to [reach out][12].\n\n[1]:\thttps://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/\n[2]:\thttps://datica-2019.netlify.app/\n[3]:\thttp://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/cowboys-and-pit-crews\n[4]:\thttp://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/\n[5]:\thttp://www.epocrates.com/oldsite/2014MobileTrendsReport/MT14_WP_03.pdf\n[6]:\thttp://files.himss.org/FileDownloads/Final%2026th%20Annual%20HIMSS%20Leadership%20Survey%20Executive%20Summary%20Web%20Site.pdf\n[7]:\thttp://info.localytics.com/blog/23-fresh-stats-and-charts-to-convince-your-boss-to-invest-more-in-mobile-in-2015\n[8]:\thttps://hipaagr.am\n[9]:\thttps://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/\n[10]:\thttps://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/hitrust/\n[11]:\thttps://hipaagr.am\n[12]:\tmailto:hello@datica.com\n"

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

    an emerging standard is starting to gain acceptance: HITRUST.'
  :blog_lead: 'Catalyze is focused on compliance, specifically compliant hosting and
    backend services. Hopefully that''s obvious or we''re doing very badly with marketing
    and messaging. We typically don''t add "HIPAA" in front of "compliance" because
    we think of compliance more broadly and there is a stigma in the healthcare industry
    attached to "HIPAA Compliance". But, our technology and organizational structure
    was built with information security at its core, and aspects of HIPAA have driven
    our policies - especially as it relates to training and educating our team members
    about the privacy and security of ePHI.

'
  :post: |+
    One of the major problems with "HIPAA Compliance" is that the rules that make up HIPAA are more like recommendations than specific rules. Most of them are very high level, and do not necessarily map to specific requirements. That leaves much up to interpretation. Because of this, an emerging standard, backed by some very big names in healthcare (United, CVS, McKesson, and more), is starting to gain acceptance. This new standard is called HITRUST. HITRUST was created to harmonize "the requirements of existing standards and regulations, including federal (HIPAA, HITECH), third party (PCI, COBIT) and government (NIST, FTC)". It raises the audit bar considerably but, at the same time, establishes a formal certification for healthcare technology security.

    HITRUST has created what it calls the [Common Security Framework (CSF)](http://www.hitrustalliance.net/commonsecurityframework/), which is a dynamic set of requirements. We think of it as a more prescriptive version of the HIPAA rules, but it's really much more than that. I say dynamic because it is updated periodically, and certifications are mapped to specific versions of the CSF. Formal HITRUST CSF Certification, with the validation of an approved auditor, lasts for 2 years. Smaller vendors can also self assess themselves against the CSF.

    We're excited to share that we've officially kicked off our HITRUST audit. Audits are hard to get excited about, but this is one we've been looking forward to for a while. The HITRUST audit is much more involved than our HIPAA assessment. It starts with us independently completing the CSF online, which is a good amount of work, then going over all of it with our independent auditors, then doing our on site audit and penetration testing, then submitting everything to HITRUST for certification. Organizations can self assess themselves against the CSF but, since we're compliance partners for our customers, we are going do the full audit to get to full certification.

    This takes time, but it's something we are committed to and something we feel is important for us and our customers. In talking to customers and prospects, they see value in our approach both to technology and to compliance more broadly. Technology is only one part of us providing compliant hosting and services to our customers. We feel that HITRUST CSF Certification will be an additional benefit to our customers and to our customers' customers.

    There are several additional things falling out of this process, all of which will help us as an organization. We'll be writing more about this, but we've changed the way that we do version control, as well as share publicly, our organizational and information security policies with customers and partners. We've also created a better risk assessment process and breach notification strategy. More on these in later posts. If you have any questions about HITRUST, please email [compliance@catalyze.io](mailto:compliance@catalyze.io).

  :summary: HITRUST is an industry-driven organization with a mission to create a
    standardized and certifiable security and compliance framework for healthcare.
  :blog_lead: |-
    ## HITRUST: A Primer

    HITRUST is an industry-driven organization with a mission to create a standardized and certifiable security and compliance framework for the healthcare industry. It was founded by and is still governed by representatives from covered entities included Unitedhealthcare, Anthem, and Highmark. The framework created by HITRUST, called the Common Security Framework (CSF), is an evolving framework now on version 8.0.

    The mission of HITRUST is to standardize the compliance framework and certification process for healthcare but also to streamline the the process of third party assurance, which basically means making it less resource intensive for both covered entities (payor, providers, clearinghouses) and business associates (BAs) as covered entities assess the risk of data security and compliance in working with third parties (BAs).
  :post: "## Victim of its own success\n\nFast forward to today—HITRUST is well accepted
    in the healthcare industry and is increasingly required by covered entities (CEs)
    for all partners and business associates. These trends are driving demand for
    HITRUST amongst business associates and, in turn, HITRUST is now seeking more
    input and feedback from the business associate community. CEs are looking to engage
    with more BAs and to leverage the HITRUST CSF as the tool to for reducing liability.
    Ultimately the need to engage with business associates is a natural result of
    the success of HITRUST in the industry and amongst CEs.\n\nBecause of this need
    to engage with business associates, HITRUST decided to form a Business Associate
    council in early 2016 to, in HITRUST's words: \n\n> ….to ensure healthcare industry
    business associates and other key vendors are able to influence and directly engage
    with HITRUST, healthcare organizations relating to the HITRUST 3rd Party Assurance
    program, and other programs impacting business associates.\n\nHITRUST called for
    volunteers to participate in providing a voice for BAs is shaping HITRUST:\n\n>
    Through interaction with the BA Council, HITRUST will work to ensure that the
    Third Party Assurance and other programs are considering and accommodating business
    associate and vendor perspectives and objectives.\n\nHITRUST [selected][1] a group
    of 17 founding members representing a diverse swath of the BA landscape from [Epic][2]
    to [Dropbox][3] to [Salesforce][4] to Datica; we're honored to be chosen and to
    lend a voice for BAs in helping to influence HITRUST initiatives and programs.\n\n##
    Why does it matter?\n\nHITRUST was founded by a group of very large CEs, all of
    which are payors. Covered entities are [fundamentally different][5] from business
    associates. Covered entities leverage business associates for services; put another
    way, covered entities are customers for business associates. There are significant
    differences around liability as CEs are liable for breaches, both for themselves
    as well as from their BAs. As such, CEs need a compliance framework they can use
    internally and this was the initial impetus for HITRUST. CEs also need a way to
    manage the risk of working with 3rd party BAs while BAs need a way to provide
    evidence to CEs that the risk in working with BAs is mitigated. The HITRUST CSF
    is emerging as the tool of choice for these use cases.\n\nIt is a 2-sides transaction
    when it comes to CEs, BAs, and third party assurance. This is a change from the
    original HITRUST use case. BAs need a compliance framework to assure not only
    their own, internal auditors and compliance groups but also the compliance groups
    at their CE customers. And there are a lot more BAs than CEs. HITRUST estimates
    that the 5 major payors mandating HITRUST for BAs impacts close to 7,500 BAs!
    That's an astounding number.\n\nIn order to meet this overwhelming demand and
    the unique needs of this new cohort, HITRUST created the Business Associate Council.
    The council is already working on several initiatives. One initiative, which started
    before the Business Associate Council but is in line with BA needs, is the concept
    of compliance inheritance within the CSF. We're confident more enhancements will
    be created based on the work of the Business Associate Council and that these
    enhancements will add value to BAs that decide to leverage the CSF as their compliance
    framework.\n\n[1]: https://hitrustalliance.net/first-business-associate-council-healthcare-industry-help-drive-efficiencies-effectiveness-third-party-assurance/\n[2]:

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
