:summary: We've taken our commitment to open source and Kubernetes a step further
  by becoming a silver member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
:blog_lead: As any of the 200+ people who have already forked Datica’s open source
  compliance policies can attest, we’ve always been a big believer in the value and
  spirit of open source. Last year our open source commitment evolved to include [Open
  Source Connectors](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)
  to help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. Most recently, the open
  source project [Kubernetes&reg;](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/)
  became the fundamental technical management layer for Datica. To take this commitment
  even further, we’re thrilled to announce we’ve become one of the newest silver members
  of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF), home of
  Kubernetes.
:post: "  \nSince 2015, Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container
  management, lending the best tools for workload deployment on public clouds. In
  addition to being cross-cloud compatible and open source, the CNCF Kubernetes project
  and community have grown at a tremendous pace. In fact, the [CNCF announced Datica
  as one of it’s 19 newest members](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-reaches-236-members-including-54-end-users-300671019.html)
  last week, bringing the membership level to 236 companies. What really makes [Kubernetes
  a viable option](https://datica.com/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) is not the core project
  itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround it.\n\nWe’re excited
  for what the future holds in this open-source-fueled era of rapid development and
  are particular excited to step into this future in partnership with the CNCF to
  collaborate with other Kubernetes developers who are trying to build secure and
  compliant products. \n\nTake a look at the [press release announcing our CNCF membership](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-joins-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/)

  :summary: If you're new to container orchestration and more familiar with a fully
    managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS), Kubernetes can seem complex. Learn the differences
    and tradeoffs.
  :blog_lead: Kubernetes® is dominating in 2018. If you're not already thinking about
    Kubernetes or at least containerization, then you're behind. Fortunately, containers
    and cloud native architectures have never been more accessible or easier to get
    started with. From infrastructure providers like AWS and Azure offering their
    own [versions of managed Kubernetes](https://sysdig.com/blog/ecs-fargate-eks-kubernetes-aws-compared/),
    to organizations like Cloud Foundry offering [Kubernetes services](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/),
    the world is shifting toward containers.
  :post: "\nIf you're working inside of a regulated industry, like healthcare or finance,
    these tools may seem out of reach. The compliance requirements and security restrictions
    of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP, NIST, PCI, and more can seem like impossible hurdles
    to jump when it comes to adopting a platform like Kubernetes.\nThis is exactly
    why [Datica is shifting toward Kubernetes](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    Our customers are asking for it, it’s the future of managing workloads born in
    the cloud, and Datica is already the most robust solution for compliance management
    on the planet. \n\nIf you're new to container orchestration and more familiar
    with a fully managed platform, like Heroku or Datica's legacy product, Kubernetes
    can seem complex. The goal of this article is to compare Kubernetes with a traditional
    PaaS, discuss the differences, and examine the tradeoffs.\n\n> Now that the world
    has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools have become ever
    larger and more complex.\n\n## What is a PaaS?\n\nA Platform as a Service, or
    a PaaS is intended to create a layer of abstraction on top of cloud service providers
    (or in some cases data centers and bare metal) so the end user can focus on deploying,
    managing, and scaling their applications and data. Without going into the [history
    of the PaaS](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/) concept,
    it's easy to think about it as a way of automating many of the repetitive, lower-level
    tasks of managing workloads on a server.\n\n## How a PaaS works\n\nThe most well
    known PaaS providers are [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
    and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). These systems work when
    developers make minimal configuration changes to their application's code and
    then simply \"push\" their code to the cloud. The PaaS will then make an attempt
    to understand the code, install the required dependencies, containerize the application,
    and then serve it up. These providers then have a UI layer for managing resources,
    networking, access, and more.\n\n## The benefits of a PaaS\n\nBeing able to directly
    push your code to the cloud and have it running is a tremendous benefit over the
    old days of standing up a server, installing an operating system (and then patching
    it each time there's a vulnerability), getting nginx configured properly, and
    much more. With a PaaS, developers can focus on delivering value via their product,
    not building IT infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being able to simply push your
    code and have it running, many of these PaaS providers also couple database managed
    services as part of their Platform.\n\n## The pitfalls of a PaaS\n\nThe ease of
    use for a PaaS comes at the cost of flexibility. Want to install custom software
    on an instance? Nope. Want to ssh into an instance to investigate an issue that
    isn't appearing in the logs? Nope. Want to do anything beyond a simple Ruby, Python,
    or Node app? Good luck.\n\nA PaaS serves a very specific purpose — to help small
    teams with simple applications run those in the cloud without the DevOps overhead
    of managing a fleet of instances on AWS or Azure.\n\nThe primary reason why so
    many PaaS providers have failed to make substantial headway in the enterprise
    space is because the model is so restrictive. For an organization managing hundreds
    of applications with petabytes of data, it makes more sense to build out a team
    that can manage all of it instead of making substantial changes to your business
    in order to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\n## Enter Kubernetes and containers\n\nNow
    that the world has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools
    have become ever larger and more complex. A small organization that just three
    years ago could have survived on Heroku is now growing at a pace that prohibits
    them from continuing to use a restrictive PaaS. Maybe they're exploring machine
    learning or want a data warehouse. Whatever the case, they've outgrown the PaaS
    model. Now they need to move to something more flexible: Kubernetes.\n\nSince
    the invention of containers, and specifically with the popularity of Docker, organizations
    have been figuring out easier ways to orchestrate containers — that is, how to
    get them running, connected and served up in the cloud. In a way, orchestration
    is the primary function of a PaaS. Because containers are relatively trivial to
    build (and in most cases the build process can be automated, ex: [Gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/))
    the focus in the container space has been on orchestration.\n\n## The benefits
    of containers\n\nThe benefits of containers over virtual machines has been discussed
    to no end on the internet. I won't go into detail here, but simply put — with
    containers, developers can port their applications from machine to machine whether
    that's running it locally on a Mac, on a server in AWS or on a droplet on Digital
    Ocean. A container is a container and it can run anywhere. Compare this to the
    complexity of managing an entire fleet  VM, each with its own OS. With containers
    there’s only one operating system to manage, even with hundreds of containers.\n\n##
    Why Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes and containers have many of the same benefits. They
    can both run anywhere and they both function the same whether they're running
    on AWS, Azure, GCP, or in the locked closet down the hall. Kubernetes is open
    source, financially backed by hundreds of organizations, and is managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). In addition to being
    cross-cloud compatible and open source, Kubernetes has also shown tremendous growth
    in the last year.\n\nIf you’re coming from a PaaS you’ll no doubt have concerns
    around the ease of use and lack of automated DevOps support in Kubernetes. When
    I first explored Kubernetes in late 2014 I walked away feeling like it was too
    complicated and didn’t fit Datica’s customer use case. In 2018 it’s a different
    story.\n\nSince Kubernetes officially hit 1.0 in 2015, the community and project
    have grown at a tremendous pace. What really makes Kubernetes a viable option
    is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround
    it. Kubernetes isn’t a PaaS, it’s a foundation on which to build a PaaS.\n\nThink
    of Kubernetes and the cloud native community as a set of building blocks. With
    these building blocks you can construct any number of different solutions. No
    longer are you held back or restricted by PaaS providers. \n\n## Which to choose\n\nThe
    decision to choose Kubernetes over a PaaS (or vice versa) is going to depend on
    your business, technology, market, team, and several other factors. Having said
    that, even if you currently have a simple application with a relatively smaller
    user base, you’re likely going to scale and change rapidly. Preparing for the
    future by moving to containers now is going to save you time and money when it
    becomes critical later on.\n"

  :summary: 'Day 3 of re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing Fargate
    among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we''re excited about Fargate?

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
    dir=\"ltr\">No longer any need to manage servers and clusters for your containers
    - AWS Fargate - Run ECS and EKS without managing servers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reInvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reInvent</a>
    <a href=\"https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL\">https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lZnS558CXV\">pic.twitter.com/lZnS558CXV</a></p>&mdash;

    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"

    why we draft as much content as we do around complicated topics like [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/),
    [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/), [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/),
    and so on. Transparency is how we, as a technology community, can better understand
    the complexity of security and compliance.\n\nThe trust that Datica's customers
    instill in us goes far beyond a simple exchange of goods. We are not only securing
    the world's most sensitive data, but providing a service to users that proves,
    beyond a reasonable doubt, that we maintain the highest level of compliance in
    doing so. In order to continue building on that trust, and delivering products
    and services that support that mission, there is a necessity for more transparency.
    In this first effort to provide increased transparency around what we are doing
    and why, we are publishing our first public product strategy and roadmap.\n\n##
    Why?\n\nIf you’re a Datica customer, or you’re considering becoming one, you will
    rely on us to provide a product that is critical in running your business. Here
    is what you can expect.\n\n### Developer operations\n\nThe Platform is a fully
    automated continuous compliance management tool for the cloud. The cloud, and
    the shared responsibility inherit within, fundamentally change the compliance
    and data liability landscape. Regardless of the support, management, or compliance
    structure your organization chooses to use, at various levels, you will rely on
    Datica to provide cloud security and compliance services. Our goal is to get compliance
    out of the way so you can focus on using the cloud tools you want to use.\n\n###
    Visibility into liability and privacy agreements\n\nThe cloud is opaque when it
    comes to liability and data privacy. At Datica, we strive to bring transparency
    to your cloud operations and your data liability radius. This is especially important
    in the case of a data breach, security incident, or audit.\n\n### Compliance and
    security\n\nAbove all the rest is compliance and security. Our customers rely
    on us to provide the highest level of compliance with our HITRUST CSF certification,
    SOC2 Type 1 and 2, and full GDPR audit (more coming soon). Additionally, they’re
    trusting us to secure their cloud environments and ensure data protection at all
    costs.\n\nGiven how much our customers rely on us to do, they need to be a part
    of the conversation. They need to have full transparency of what we are building.
    That is not to say we’ve been developing the Platform in a vacuum. We work one-on-one
    with users on a daily basis. We’re constantly taking feedback and building that
    back into the product. However, we’ve not always been as transparent as we could
    have been when it comes to the current set of product initiatives. We’re hoping
    to change that with the public product strategy and roadmap (ex: “Hey, I see you're
    working on an update to your vulnerability scanning component, feature X would
    be really nice...”, etc.). Our goal is to give the market a full view of what
    we’re doing and why we’re doing it. \n\nCloud technology and the companies running
    the underlying infrastructure are moving at an incredible speed. By making our
    roadmap and strategy transparent, our hope is to gauge ourselves against this
    speed and adapt accordingly. Datica is a compliance and security company. The
    mechanisms by which we deliver those two value propositions will and should change
    with time.\n\n> Datica’s mission is to empower organizations around the world
    to take their preferred tools, use them in a cloud setting, and then provide and
    maintain the highest standards of security and compliance around those tools.
    \n\n## The Risk\n\nOften when companies are first starting out they view their
    value as a secret. What they’re doing and how they’re doing it is seen as magic
    sauce. They want to harbor that magic. As companies grow and mature, they tend
    to learn that the magic is in execution, not the intellectual property or ideas.
    At Datica, we’ve assembled the best team of security, cloud, and compliance experts
    to execute on designing and delivering the most secure and compliant Platform
    for the cloud. We have no secrets to keep.\n\nWith that said, I’m proud to announce
    [Datica’s public product strategy & roadmap](https://datica.com/compliant-kubernetes-service/roadmap/).
    This document will serve as the window into Platform product development. To get
    the most out of this effort, we need to hear from you. Please send us your feedback,
    feature requests, and ideas to [product@datica.com](mailto:product@datica.com)."

  :summary: Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined
    with Open-Source Connectors for the Datica Platform.
  :blog_lead: Today we are launching one-click installations of [Mirth Connect](https://www.mirth.com/)
    combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help
    solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution
    is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration
    in the best way possible.
  :post: "> Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. We aim to empower the developer community to solve
    the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
    and secure.\n\nThe launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need
    more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing
    at scale, and future-proofing for things like [FHIR](/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.\n\nDatica has been doing healthcare
    integration since October 2014, going through a [few iterations in pricing and
    packaging](/blog/announcing-self-service-and-free-trials/). Regardless of the
    iteration, our pragmatic, partnership approach remained consistent and accomplished
    a lot. In three years we built a team of experts to deliver on integrations and
    delivered over 150 live integrations into healthcare organizations, with many
    more in process. Historically it was a SaaS-based pricing model where customers
    paid a fixed fee per month per interface, per site or even an annual license to
    purchase site-based delivery. We did integration work in every major vertical:
    vendors, life sciences, healthcare organizations, and payers.\n\nTimes have changed
    since 2014 in the integration world. The cloud has gone from a taboo term in digital
    health to the default place to build 99% of new healthcare applications. FHIR
    has gone from a glimmer in [Grahame Grieve's](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1/)
    eye into an API platform that will soon be made available from most of the big
    EHRs. A new wave of digital health developers believe in openness first, even
    at hospitals as they look to commercialize IP in a digital format. There was no
    way to predict this would happen so fast (at least in healthcare, three years
    seems fast) but we are here now.\n\nOver the last three years, we learned the
    best way to help our customers was to teach them this point: there is no silver
    bullet to integration **but it is a problem you can solve with the right tools**.
    \n\nThat's why we are releasing the ability to deploy Mirth Connect with \"one-click\"
    into your [Datica environment](/platform/). You gain the expertise we've built
    on running reliable and available integration capabilities in one-click, deployed
    directly into your compliant environment on the Datica platform. Mirth, which
    is an open-source platform itself, is a great tool for software developers to
    use for integration. This is why we've written up documentation based on the hundreds
    of integrations that we've done which can teach you quickly how to [get started
    on using Mirth](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001535023-Mirth-Getting-Started).\n\n##
    Open-Source Mirth Connectors\n\nWe also [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
    for transforming data from HL7 to JSON. This is a major evolution for digital
    health teams. We do not believe in locking customers into proprietary APIs, so
    we have published everything we've learned at the transformation layer, with many
    more scripts to come. It's all in an effort to help you gain more transparency
    and confidence with [EHR integration](/discover/ehr-integrations/).\n\nThese connectors
    are a series of libraries that can be plugged into your Mirth Connect environment
    which immediately enable HL7 feeds for consumption by a restful API. We will be
    continuing to open-source content as we create it, including transformers to other
    data types like those for [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Office
    365 Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors).
    The only major limitations behind what we aim to open-source will be transforms
    which are based on vendor-specific connections or data models which we can't expose
    due to legal reasons (e.g. Epic Interconnect XML data models).\n\n## Integration
    Environment Details\n\nTake note: the integration environment is much more than
    just Mirth. Each environment has a bundle of tools important to successful integration:\n\n*
    Highly Available (HA) configuration of Mirth instances. HA operations of Mirth
    are not trivial. We make it easy, instantly.\n* HA configuration of Postgres.
    A supplemental database is important for initial message ingestion, and must support
    a similar HA nature for continuous connection.\n* Load balancers.\n* Network monitoring
    and usage alerts. Understanding the traffic usage is important for audit purposes.
    Additional alerting is important for ongoing management of a connection.\n* VPN
    Management. Remember, you do not integrate with Epic, you integrate with a specific
    site's version of Epic. Therefore you'll need a VPN for every integration you
    plan to make. Our VPN tooling makes it easy, combined with our expertise in how
    to ensure they stay connected 24/7.\n\nThe integration environment is available
    in both the [Standard and Professional plans](/pricing). The environment is not
    available for free trials (yet), but will be soon. Along with this update, we
    have now made VPN management available in the Standard plan as well, so people
    can get started with EHR integration for as low as $1,150/mo.\n\nWe're often asked
    how much throughput a typical environment can handle. The answer is _a lot_. A
    single environment with no modifications can handle as many as fifty site integrations.
    If customers need to scale throughput, they simply scale RAM. If you have any
    additional questions, [please reach out](/services/#cta). We're happy to chat.\n\n##
    Pricing Updates\n\nOne thing you may notice is that we do not bundle the integration
    environment with professional services under the name of \"Managed Integration\"
    anymore.\n\nOur customers that have greater challenges or unique needs can now
    purchase both separately since services are now optional.\n\nThis means digital
    health teams can get all the integration tooling they need — along with HITRUST
    CSF Certified, HIPAA compliant, secure infrastructure housed under one [Business
    Associate Agreement](/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    — for as little as $1,150/mo.\n\nThe other exciting news about Datica's pricing
    is that this scales much better for you. It's pricing that is truly aligned with
    your success.\n\n## The Future of Integration Is Open\n\nThis is a shift in how
    we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health
    companies. You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance
    and security, but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. This
    new option gives that to you with a single click.\n\nHealthcare developers can
    get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.
    We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration
    themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure.\n\nFor moments
    where projects seem too difficult, [our integration services team](/services)
    will be ready to jump in and help you with that lift. We see a world in which
    all of our customers can eventually own their own integrations and we want to
    provide the easiest path for customers to be able to manage that themselves. [Reach
    out](/services/#cta) if you have any questions, we'd love to help you out.\n"

  :summary: This Q&A with Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, explores what
    it means that Datica just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies.
  :blog_lead: |-
    A week ago, Chief Data Officer [Mark Olschesky](https://datica.com/about/mark/) used Slack to announce that Datica had just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies. Of course, the company wise-crackers quickly posted the obligatory Yogi Berra response:

    > When you come to a fork in the road, take it!
  :post: "As with many technical terms, the word “fork” obviously had more than one
    meaning. The mention of this particular company achievement, along with its oddly
    referenced name suddenly had my non-technical mind driving for answers. I needed
    to uncover not only what a “fork” was, but also why having 200 of them came with
    so many “thumbs up” and “clapping hand” emoticons. The discovery called for a
    quick Q&A with none other than torchbearer himself, [Mark Olschesky](/about/mark/).
    \n\n#### Q: Just what is a “fork” in technical terms?\n\n**Mark:**  A fork is
    a term for duplicating a code or document repository. It’s not required. Someone
    could simply download the source from the repository without us knowing at all.
    In the open-source world, “forks” and “stars” are a common way to track the success
    of a project. We use [GitHub to host our policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies/);
    there, you can track all changes made to the policies by reviewing forks made
    by our customers.\n\n#### Q: Participating in open-source projects has been strategic
    for Datica, can you tell me more about its importance to the company?\n\n**Mark:**
    When the company was founded in 2013, the industry had its share of duplicitous
    vendors peddling “HIPAA-compliant” solutions for hosting and application development.
    Turns out that many of those solutions were far from compliant. As a company that,
    1) wanted to do more to make compliance in the cloud easier and, 2) was not the
    first HIPAA-compliant vendor, the company needed to go the extra mile to prove
    our compliance and differentiate the company from the rest of the market beyond
    base market copy.\n\n#### Q: How did that differentiation begin?\n\n**Mark:**
    During Datica’s first HITRUST audit, CEO Travis Good, MD saw the potential for
    sharing what we’d learned with the entire industry via open-source policies. He
    then made the following strategic decisions:\n\n- Datica should publish our policies
    in a way that allows them to be easily tracked over time (GitHub).\n- We should
    open-source the policies to both engender goodwill with the developer community
    and to also demonstrate the lengths that Datica goes for its customers versus
    other “HIPAA-compliant” vendors. \n- Provide a way for other companies with existing
    infrastructure or that didn’t want to host with Datica to fork those policies
    and make them their own. As such, we would show different flavors of how to demonstrate
    compliance with different application stacks or organizational differences.\n\n####
    Q: How does forking of our open-source policies help healthcare in general?\n\n**Mark:**
    As a company, Datica does not manage all the parts of HIPAA. For example, we don’t
    employ clinicians or have software that performs medical decision-making or automated
    outreach to patients. As such, it’s hard for our policies to be the definitive
    guide for “what it means to be HIPAA compliant.”\n\n#### Q: That sounds counterintuitive
    to the ultimate goal of HIPAA compliance. Can you explain how forks play into
    that?\n\n**Mark:** By looking at forks, you can see what other customers have
    done. Most commonly, you can see companies with different Business Associate Agreements
    (BAAs). You’ll also see some major material differences through the forks. \n\n####
    Q: Can you give me a good example of a fork?\n\n**Mark:** One is Bind. As an insurer/broker
    (and therefore likely a [Covered Entity](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    their policies will differ from Datica’s as a cloud infrastructure/tooling provider.
    Bind’s willingness to share what they’ve done could help other insurers or brokers
    with their path to build and demonstrate compliance. That can save everyone time
    and money. That savings allows organizations to work on the real problems in healthcare.\n\n####
    Q: When the 200th fork came in from the Chief Technology Officer of a care coordination
    platform, you shared this good news with the entire company. Why was this an important
    achievement?\n\n**Mark:** Many open-source projects don’t receive much attention,
    so it’s great to see that Datica’s open-sourced policies are one of the more popular
    open source projects in healthcare compliance. The Linux Foundation took a similar
    approach a year later in [publishing their policies](https://github.com/lfit/itpol).
    Datica is proud to be one of the earlier innovators in a space that facilitates
    transparency in best practices by publishing those policies. As a company we strive
    to constantly do what’s best for our customers, but also the industry as a whole.\n"

    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div

    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica

    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
