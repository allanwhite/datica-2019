:summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
  and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
:blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major area
  of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR. GDPR,
  which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for the much
  anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect in May of
  2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general rule, and
  the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across all EU Member
  States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar with healthcare
  privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned with HIPAA, to
  GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even security requirements
  more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles and privacy guidelines
  for health data under GDPR.
:post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
  both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes
  through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
  our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started with
  HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
  as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added SOC2,
  Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR audit in
  2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build and maintain
  one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased
  words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
  \                                                                                       \n##
  GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
  because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
  at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
  and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
  health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process data
  for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is based.\n\nHealthcare
  and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
  applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
  data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
  even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities: controllers and processors\n\nIn
  the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity (CE) or a business associate
  (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors are just business associates
  of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re either a controller or a processor.
  The structures don’t mirror each other 100% but controllers, like covered entities,
  are the organizations that ultimately own personal data and processors, like business
  associates, provide services, or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major
  difference is that HIPAA strictly defines covered entities based on functions in
  healthcare as providers, payors, and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers
  as “natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone
  or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing of personal
  data.” HIPAA defines entities based on the function of the organization and GDPR
  defines it based on the ownership of data; this is a consistent theme throughout
  GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare
  organizations need to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like
  Fitbit, MapMyRun, or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical
  company, would be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t
  need to adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider
  or payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
  and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
  This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
  control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
  responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
  put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
  covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in place
  with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs to be
  included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking in the
  HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection and transparency
  over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR requires, with some
  rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the relationship between
  controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability of processors to
  aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly to the US and
  HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must have similar
  DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach reporting\n\nUnder
  GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline to report breaches
  is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization adhering to HIPAA
  would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts, and/or BAAs; but,
  most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers and vendors are on
  the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen), weeks, and even months.
  The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our own Datica breach reporting
  time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply with GDPR, there are changes
  that need to be made both technically and operationally to commit to 72 hour breach
  reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR puts forth clear guidelines
  for when health data can be processed, or essentially when it can be accessed. Under
  GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with explicit consent from the individual,
  2) for health and social care, and 3) for public health (cross border containment
  being the example given). There are some nuances to this, specifically with data
  for scientific or clinical research, but those are mainly only with explicit consent.
  HIPAA similarly defines permitted uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment,
  2) payment, and 3) healthcare operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at
  least in comparing it to HIPAA, are the rights of individuals to get access to all
  of their data and to be forgotten (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data
  is much more extensive than other types of data like payment data; it’s the reason
  complying with HIPAA isn’t the same as complying with PCI where you can essentially
  outsource payment processing to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data
  or being able to delete all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for
  large, bloated EHRs and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact
  Assessments\n\nOne of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching
  principle of data protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance,
  is often an afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst.
  GDPR explicitly attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA,
  and in this way is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment,
  analysis, and management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR
  requires controllers and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments
  (DPIAs), which are just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should
  be performed before the start of development work and done periodically throughout
  the lifecycle of a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based
  model is similar to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop
  a baseline risk model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the
  model we use at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance
  for us and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything
  with healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
  violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
  whichever is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you
  need to expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----
  \                                                                                                   \nGoing
  forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR. We’ll
  also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security and compliance
  programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR
  is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is
  ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each
  framework.\n\n"

  :blog_lead: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union

    by the European Court of Justice. The [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome),
    which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies a stronger obligation
    on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either self-certify for the
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment. This [self-certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1)
    or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy Shield Framework requirements
    that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
  :post: "\nWhile everyone is gearing up for the General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) that goes into effect for the European Union on May 25, 2018, one critical
    facet cannot be overlooked for customers who aspire to work internationally.\n\n##
    Q & A with Lori Meals\n\nDatica Director of Compliance Lori Meals has been gathering
    more details on the Privacy Shield and readying Datica for its own self-certification.
    She recently sat down to answer questions on the topic that will be helpful to
    you as you think through the necessary steps in bringing private health data back
    to the states from abroad.\n \n### Why are the privacy protections more stringent
    in the European Union than the U.S.?\n \nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to this sort of personal data being
    shared.\n \n### Why was the Safe Harbour Framework invalidated and the EU-U.S.
    Privacy Shield enacted in its place?\n \nAll comes down to [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).
    Remember him? He’s the former National Security Association (NSA) contractor who
    revealed that the intelligence agency had been spying on European citizen data
    held by American companies.  That snowball quickly rolled downhill to Facebook.
    Austrian student Max Schrems filed subsequent lawsuits, alleging that Facebook
    had not been protecting personal data of Europeans, as extrapolated from the Snowden
    leaks. Those leaks showed that the NSA performed surveillance on technology companies,
    like Facebook. His complaints landed in the European Court of Justice whose governance
    quickly invalidated the Safe Harbour Framework and exacted a seismic shift upon
    international data privacy.\n\n### Is the Privacy Shield certification required
    for Datica?\n \nNo, it is not incumbent upon us, but it is for our customers,
    assuming they are expanding into Europe and/or using European citizen data. Without
    the Privacy Shield, a U.S. company is potentially liable when not adhering to
    these principles.\n \n### What must a customer know about Privacy Shield?\n \nThe
    Privacy Shield has a couple of important vocabulary words: data controller and
    data processor. Datica would be the “data processor” because we only work on behalf
    of those who are collecting the data. The Privacy Shield lays out the data protection
    principles that gives an individual the right to know that a company not only
    holds your data, but that the individual can request that such data be deleted,
    updated or changed, as well as requesting copies of it.\n \n### Is there anything
    else that a Datica customer needs to know?\n \nBefore expanding into Europe, U.S.
    companies must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). The DPA signifies the agreement
    the parties’ have made with respect to terms governing personal data processing.
    Organizations will also need to contract with a 3rd party to handle complaints
    about how the organization handles data, should any arise. \n\n### How does this
    impact digital health companies long-term?\n \nThe rules and regulations have
    become more stringent upon U.S. companies involved with cross border data transfers.
    Abiding by the European requirements is imperative for staying out of hot legal
    waters. \n\nDatica exists to help make digital health companies successful whether
    they work solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial
    waters between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today.
    When everyone follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success
    and decrease the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\n"

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica.com/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: 'Makers of digital health products need to be ready for GDPR, which takes
    effect on May 25, 2018. This overview guides you through the basics of GDPR compliance,
    data breach notifications, and much more. '
  :featured_image:
    :id: 6LTxW4dsIwEcU6uaIOCUYw
  :lead: "## What is the GDPR?\nGDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation,
    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
    applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the
    academy article, [GDPR for Cloud Service Providers.](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)\n\n##
    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica.com/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
    experts](https://datica.com/contact/) today to find out how you can be compliant
