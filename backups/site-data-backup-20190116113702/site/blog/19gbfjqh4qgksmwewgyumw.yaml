  The current best way to assess (or at least to categorize) [patient engagement](https://datica.com/blog/whats-your-patient-engagement-strategy/) programs, activities, and maturity is to use the [Patient Engagement Framework](http://himss.files.cms-plus.com/HIMSSorg/NEHCLibrary/HIMSS_Foundation_Patient_Engagement_Framework.pdf) developed by the National eHealth Collaborative and HIMSS. The framework lays out stages of engagement, and progression of individuals through those stages. It aligns at a high level  with Meaningful Use stages (and projections of future stages).

  Below are stages of engagement.

  1. **Inform me**. As it sounds, this stage is purely information and mostly generic. There is some specification at the level of medication or diagnosis for care plans, but by and large, this is generic and  pre-Meaningful Use. Printable forms also fall into this bucket. I hope that most organizations don’t see this as a major accomplishment.
  2. **Engage me**. This takes a slightly more interactive approach with tools for tracking data like nutrition and fitness as well as access to interactive forms for prescription refills. It’s largely transactional at this stage and not an integrated approach or platform.
  3. **Empower me**. As the stage name implies, this is when patients start to get some say and provide feedback, as well as ratings. Organizations might offer patients virtual visits and secure messaging at this stage. Patients can share medical records here as well. Fortunately, at least for 14 percent of the population, this is when materials are available in Spanish.
  4. **Partner with me**. Taking empowerment one step further, the tools here are meant to provide self-care capabilities. Data is largely integrated at this stage and collaborative care is enabled.
  5. **Support my e-community**. This stage is varied if you look at all the things that are happening. The common theme seems to be around patients working together with broader care teams. Chiropractic, dental, and alternative medicine are integrated into the collaborative team model at this stage (there had to be some lobbies at the table to get this included.)

  The framework highlights the looseness and lack of clear definition for patient engagement, which is all over the place, like throwing stuff at a wall to see what sticks. It looks as though it was created in an effort to capture everything that could be done with digital health data and tech-enabled services, not even exclusively for patients.

  I’m all for data interoperability and care team collaboration, but I don’t think that’s patient engagement. The counter argument might be that care team collaboration makes navigating the system easier for patients and, in turn, helps keep them engaged.

  Two of my favorite points are:

  - Option to share progress and health milestones on social media.
  - Guides to understanding accountable care.

  If I was creating an engagement framework, I’d take a more metrics-driven approach. I wouldn’t define a 5-10 year roadmap of features and services for patients.

  In the end, maybe we shouldn’t be modeling out the services and features we think patients will want 4-5 years in advance. Maybe we should instead be focused on talking to patients / consumers and providers to learn what they want and what they need. Start very small. See what features people use and how they use them, then build out additional features. Much in the same way modern tech companies and app developers track usage metrics religiously, let usage metrics for websites, portals, and messaging services drive the patient engagement decisions.

  It seems backwards to map it all out now. Maybe patients just want to be able to send secure messages to providers, conduct virtual visits, or go to Walgreens for a visit. Maybe they don’t care about having access to a longitudinal record of their health.

  Speaking of that, why is [data interoperability](https://datica.com/blog/why-interoperability/) a part of patient engagement? Why is [Meaningful Use](https://datica.com/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/) driving — or defining in this case — patient engagement? Maybe patient engagement shouldn’t be part of Meaningful Use. The expression “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail” is often used as an argument against the super-specialized nature of practice.

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\n*
    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
