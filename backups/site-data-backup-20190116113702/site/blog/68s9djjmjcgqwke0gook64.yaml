:summary: Whether you’re a Datica customer or not, you can take these new configuration
  guides, implement them across your fleet of cloud services, and have an audit-ready
  environment without paying a dime.
:blog_lead: Cloud compliance is complex — not because the configurations themselves
  are complex, or that the technology tooling doesn't exist to achieve proper configuration;
  rather it takes time, knowledge, and even creativity to understand what exactly
  those configurations should be. This is especially true of healthcare compliance
  where no regime is going to tell you word for word how to configure your cloud environments.
  Instead, you're going to have to spend time and money understanding each framework,
  what applies to your organization, and how your organization is going to solve specific
  controls. You’ll then have to implement, measure and manage that policy in perpetuity,
  a task made more difficult by the highly dynamic nature of cloud services.
:post: "\nAt Datica we've spent the last five years working at the intersection of
  cloud computing and healthcare compliance — we've talked with thousands of developers
  and engineers — we've built a portfolio of products that addresses these concerns
  head on. However, even in a world where you're using a product like [Datica's CKS](https://datica.com/compliant-kubernetes-service/),
  you'll likely have services and systems that live outside of that management layer.
  Understanding how to bring these services up to par in terms of compliance is anything
  but clear.\n\nIn our pursuit of making healthcare compliance more accessible to
  all, we're releasing configuration guides for popular cloud services like Amazon
  RDS, Azure Cosmos DB and Google Cloud SQL. These configuration guides are mapped
  to the [HITRUST CSF 9.1](https://hitrustalliance.net/whats-new-csf-v9-1/), which
  can easily be crosswalked to multiple compliance regimes like HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR,
  NIST, etc, meaning these cloud configurations can easily be mapped to multiple compliance
  regimes. Our goal is to work with the community to eventually cover all cloud services
  available across these three major cloud providers.\n\n## These configurations provide
  a number of benefits\n\n1. Datica has been HITRUST certified for over four years
  and complies with HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR and GxP. These configurations are part of
  our core system and adhere to our [open source policies](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/).
  Users can freely implement these configurations, adopt the open source policies
  and have a verifiable, audit ready environment in a very short amount of time.\n2.
  They work well with Datica’s existing products. If you’re a Datica customer or are
  considering becoming one, you can rest easy knowing that these configurations provide
  the same level of compliance coverage that Datica’s managed products offer. This
  produces unparalleled compliance continuity, ultimately improving the efficiency
  of compliance audits.\n3. They’re free. Whether you’re a Datica customer or not,
  you can take these guides, implement them across your fleet of cloud services, and
  have an audit-ready environment without paying a dime.\n\n## Why we chose to start
  with Databases\n\nManaging stateful applications within Kubernetes is a notoriously
  difficult problem to solve. As a result, many organizations turn to cloud providers
  to offload this work. Services like [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Azure
  Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), and [Google Cloud
  SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) are popular among developers for their ease
  of use, scale and reliability. The demand we’ve received to support these services
  has been tremendous. As a result, the initial release of [Datica CCMS](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/)
  will come with support for these three services. The CCMS, coupled with these guides,
  will provide an end to end compliance management structure for your cloud environment.\n\n##
  Anatomy of the guides\n\nThese guides are intended to be step-by-step, opinionated
  tutorials that explain the relevance of a specific configuration within the context
  of HITRUST. For those unfamiliar with HITRUST (and its relationship to HIPAA), please
  [read through this HITRUST guide](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/).\n\nIn
  these database guides we’ll walk through configuring each database to be HITRUST
  CSF ready and then show how the CCMS will continuously check these configurations
  via REST APIs (which you could programmatically implement yourself). To understand
  the structure of how we think about compliance at Datica, which is important to
  grasp in order to take full advantage of these guides, see the visualization below.\n\n![Ryan
  blog graphic](//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3V7Rsgt3kA6U6suGGUWwQw/1dea88970842b1cf8e9354650e30cf78/Ryan_blog_graphic.png)\n_The
  bridge between “Compliance Controls” and “Configurations” is policy, while the bridge
  between “Configurations” and “APIs” is measurement._\n\n\nDedicated compliance tools
  are often too focused on controls, that is, the specific requirements of regimes
  like HITRUST, HIPAA, GDPR and more. For developers this is an issue, because ultimately
  they need to understand exactly what a specific control means, and what configurations
  need to be in place in order to satisfy that requirement. Unfortunately these tools
  don’t provide such guidance. They assume knowledge of compliance and established
  policy.\n\nThe CCMS and these guides are different. By starting with the configurations,
  developers can immediately grasp and understand what needs to be done. Ex: “turn
  on encryption”. This configuration is very straight forward and not muddled in compliance
  jargon. Then, using the rest of the guide, developers can map that configuration
  back to a control, as well as an API call that would give them a programmatic way
  to ensure that configuration is in place (either at a point in time, or on a continuous
  basis).\n\n## Introducing the first three configuration guides\n\n1. [AWS RDS Guide
  - How to configure RDS to comply with HIPAA and HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n2.
  [Azure Cosmos DB Guide - How to configure Cosmos DB to comply with HIPAA and HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/azure-cosmos-db-guide-how-to-configure-cosmos-db-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n3.
  [Google Cloud SQL Guide - How to configure GCP Cloud SQL to comply with HIPAA and
  HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/google-cloud-sql-guide-how-to-configure-gcp-cloud-sql-to-comply-with-hipaa/)\n`\n\n##
  What's on your wish list?\n\nWe treasure feedback from developers like you and want
  to know which cloud services matter to you. [Fill out a survey here](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/survey/)
  to let us know which services you use as part of your product that need to be configured
  for HITRUST compliance. \n\n\n"

  :summary: We're pleased to announce the Datica CCMS — our latest and most flexible
    product that has an eye on the future.
  :blog_lead: |
    Today I am excited to announce Datica's latest product, the [Cloud Compliance Management System](https://datica.com/ccms), or CCMS.

    The CCMS is a symbol of the future of digital health on the cloud, and an evolution in vision from Datica.
  :post: "Back in 2013 when we started this journey, several conditions existed which
    prompted us to build the first and only [compliant platform-as-a-service](https://datica.com/compliant-platform-as-a-service/):\n\n_That
    was then..._\n\n* The HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule was signed, and a lot of confusion
    existed as to what compliance on the cloud actually looked like\n* AWS was the
    only major public cloud provider who signed a worthwhile BAA\n* Within their BAA,
    only 4 services were actually \"HIPAA eligible\"\n* Microservices hadn't yet taken
    off\n* Docker was barely 1.0\n* Public availability of Kubernetes wasn't even
    a thing\n* Other PaaS products like Heroku didn't yet sign BAAs\n\nThe options
    for cloud infrastructure were limited for digital health apps, creating one of
    the many constraints on their success. Catalyze.io, [which we later rebranded
    to Datica in February 2017](https://datica.com/catalyze), changed the game by
    providing a container-based deployment mechanism for cloud native environments
    that was 100% HIPAA compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified.\n\nFast forward five
    years. It's incredible how much the technology world has changed, and for the
    better.\n\n_...This is now_\n\n* AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all sign rock-solid
    BAAs\n* There are over 100 \"HIPAA eligible\" services across those clouds\n*
    Compliance is now more confidently understood on the cloud\n* Cloud native architectures
    are substantially more mature due to the global efforts of Docker, Kubernetes,
    et al\n* Microservices and managed services rule the day\n\nWhile a Compliant
    PaaS model has immense value for n-tier digital health applications looking to
    offload the entirety of DevOps and DevSecOps obligations, the fact is, in 2018,
    digital health applications simply demand more options with emerging cloud technology.\n\nDatica
    saw this in 2017, which is why we launched our [Compliant Kubernetes Service](https://datica.com/compliant-kubernetes-service/)
    (CKS) in March 2018, the only HITRUST CSF Certified k8s cluster in the world.
    Customers told us how badly they wanted to use Kubernetes, but there were no good
    compliant options in 2017. CKS is a bridge product to help satisfy compliant k8s
    use cases for more complex digital health apps. Since then, all three major clouds
    now include their respective Kubernetes managed service in their respective BAAs,
    but attestation is proving hard for customers since so much of the configuration
    information required for assessments is unavailable via APIs or UIs. (Simple example:
    customers can't ascertain the OS or OS version running a k8s cluster.) Datica
    CKS has a role to play until the healthcare developers can successfully attest
    to assessments with other managed Kubernetes services.\n\nThe immediate problem
    with CKS, however, is that the Datica promise of compliance only extends to the
    k8s cluster itself. Most of the engineering world is interested in combining application
    orchestration platforms like Kubernetes with existing managed services, like managed
    databases AWS RDS, Azure Cosmos DB, or GCP Cloud SQL. Most people we talk to have
    a constellation of managed services comprising their cloud environment. Beginning
    at the start of 2018, we asked ourselves, _\"How can we empower digital health
    to adapt to the future of managed and microservices?\"_\n\nThat question drove
    the development of the [CCMS](https://datica.com/ccms).\n\nThe answer started
    with a fundamental shift in philosophy from Datica. The future of compliance is
    less a controlling one where we guarantee compliance by owning root on hosts,
    but rather a SaaS-based one that empowers endless number of architecture permutations
    based on the needs and desires of developers.\n\nThe challenge is the opaque responsibility
    hoisted on developers. \n\n* Most developers are unsure the exact configurations
    of certain managed services in order to map to specific framework controls.\n*
    Most developers are confused about the relationship between Privacy, Security,
    and Compliance—no, you are not compliant just by doing security things.\n* Most
    developers are unaware that compliance attestation is a 24/7 monitoring exercise,
    and not a set-it-and-forget-it job.\n* Most developers are mistaken that because
    their given cloud is compliant, the Shared Responsibility model means their business
    is now compliant. That is unequivocally false.\n\nThe CCMS solves those issues
    for developers. It is a SaaS tool which monitors the configuration states of supported
    managed services across the three major clouds. Each configuration is explicitly
    audited against the HITRUST CSF, ensuring that if adopted, the configured managed
    service should pass a HITRUST CSF assessment.\n\nAlong with the announcement of
    the CCMS, we also launched free configuration guides for the three most basic
    managed database services across AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\n* [AWS RDS](https://datica.com/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n*
    [Azure Cosmos DB configuration guide](https://datica.com/academy/azure-cosmos-db-guide-how-to-configure-cosmos-db-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n*
    [Google Cloud SQL configuration guide](https://datica.com/academy/google-cloud-sql-guide-how-to-configure-gcp-cloud-sql-to-comply-with-hipaa/)\n\nEach
    guide gives a step-by-step walkthrough on how to configure the respective service
    to the HITRUST CSF. We will be launching more guides throughout the fall. Each
    guide will be an example of how the CCMS will function.\n\n## Empowering developers
    is the future of digital health\n\nWe believe so strongly in the present and future
    situation that we wrote a book about it, launching last month. _Complete Cloud
    Compliance_ is a 100-page explanation of the conditions of compliant, the cloud,
    and data interoperability that lead healthcare technology to where it is today,
    but more importantly where it is moving in the future.\n\nThe book will be generally
    available for purchase (at cost) later this year. To sign up to be notified of
    availability, head over to [completecloudcompliance.com](https://completecloudcompliance.com).\n\n##
    The CCMS is generally available in early 2019\n\nWe are diligently building the
    CCMS and working toward a generally available release. Existing Datica customers
    will get a limited availablility preview this fall, with new customers being able
    to sign up in early 2019.\n\nSo why are we announcing this today?\n\nIn short:
    Because there is no use in waiting to discuss the future. \n\nIt's to everyone's
    advantage to start talking about what empowering digital health developers looks
    like on the modern cloud. It's to our advantage to get feedback from people like
    you on which cloud services matter to you. ([Fill out a survey here to let us
    know!](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/survey/)) And it's
    to your advantage to know that as a digital health developer, you **can** participate
    in modern development choices while having the confidence that you can pass a
    HITRUST assessment.\n\nLet us know what you think! Keep an eye out for continued
    discussion throughout the rest of 2018.\n"

  :summary: 'On Wednesday, September 26th, Datica will host a webinar that will dive
    into the topic of how healthcare compliance has evolved in the cloud era. '
  :blog_lead: In 2013, when the final HIPAA Omnibus was ruled, compliance on the cloud
    was an opaque understanding. It took collaboration among cloud services providers
    such as AWS, Azure, and Google, digital health companies like Datica, and the
    good folks at HITRUST and Coalfire (among many deserving others) to collectively
    define what it meant.
  :post: |2

    The process has been hard. Along the way, we learned a lot while also building little mental models or explanations to help distill the evolving complexity into digestible chunks for those looking to make a dent in this industry. Many of those simplifications we put into our new book, [*Complete Cloud Compliance*](https://completecloudcompliance.com), which launched this month.

    The book tries to answer the question "What Really Is Compliance?" and we think we do a decent job for those who aren't a professional compliance officer. The concepts are familiar to those with deep compliance experience, but we believe are the most efficient explainer for those who truly aren't sure how to answer the question themselves. We thought, if we can help everyone else learn our compliance lessons over the past five years, we can make *our* dent in this industry.

    On Wednesday, September 26th, I'll be giving [a webinar where I dive deeper](https://datica.com/webinars/what-really-is-compliance/) into the topic. I will be summarizing many key concepts throughout the book. For those who have 45 minutes open over lunchtime, I encourage you to attend.

    A few big ideas we will explore tomorrow:

    * Compliance is not the same as security is not the same as privacy
    * Rules and controls are very different, and it's important to understand that
    * The faster you can map the difference between organizations, standards, frameworks, and regulations, the faster all these acronyms will make sense to you
    * The global nature of compliance
    * Why frameworks matter
    * How to map a compliance regime onto your cloud architecture

    Please join me on Wednesday. Feedback is always welcome!

    ## Best practices are best practices

    Compliance is global, however, with highly regulated industries spanning many geographies. The requirements to meet [GDPR regulations](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/) by May 25th pushed us to examine a compliance posture that was international instead of HIPAA specific.

    The nearly year-long exercise was a catalyst for our compliance team to innovate on how we could be bigger than just GDPR. We took a look at compliance holistically, and globally, to come up with a strategy that will allow us to better serve customers across industries and geographies.

    The result is simplified with a phrase we use internally: _Best Practices are Best Practices_.

    ## The Datica global compliance roadmap

    Datica's ability to serve international compliance regimes stems from a philosophy exemplified by [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/): one framework, many regimes. We decided to take a single compliance framework, make it our root attestation, and then plan to use it as a repeatable mapping process towards other regimes. HITRUST and its Common Security Framework was clearly the answer.

    HITRUST has done a great job of aiming for big goals. With version 9.1 of the CSF, we believe there are few better options for the most stringent and comprehensive compliance auditing framework on the cloud. The HITRUST CSF is our DNA framework.

    By using HITRUST, we will crosswalk the CSF to other geographies and compliance regimes, thus accelerating our ability to support compliance attestations in those areas. Certainly unique considerations will exist in respective geographies before we can officially support compliant deployments of the Datica Platform in a country, but the CSF will get us almost all the way there in all cases.

    As has been the drumbeat since [Datica's founding in 2013](https://datica.com/about/), transparency is the key to distilling the complexity of compliance. Transparency is how we best help healthcare — and other regulated industries — move forward. To communicate our global compliance posture to both present and future customers, we built a handy table that documents our compliance roadmap.

    <img class="lozad group" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=600" data-srcset="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=800 1000w, //images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png 1200w" alt="global compliance stance table" />

    The table is simple:

    * We list geographies and certain regimes that matter in those geographies.
    * One column states if that regime is currently supported by the platform.
    * Another column states if we have plans to support it someday.
    * And lastly, for those we plan to support, we give a broad estimation to when the HITRUST crosswalk will be done along with any additional specific requirements for the respective regime.

    This table will be updated a lot throughout 2018 as we test our compliance posture against new regimes.

    We invite you to take a look at public global compliance roadmap by visiting the [Global Compliance Posture](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance/global/) page of our website.

    In short, we plan to take HITRUST global to both geographies and regimes that we haven't previously supported. We want to be the best compliance management option for cloud native applications across the world.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
