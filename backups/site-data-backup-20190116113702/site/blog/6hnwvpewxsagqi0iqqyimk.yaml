  Datica love working with digital health companies trying to innovate within healthcare.
:blog_lead: 'When we started working with [PACT](http://www.gym-pact.com/) on a tailored
  compliant environment for their growing platform, we were impressed. First, their
  [product video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsGJsMLTmiA) brought a smile to
  our faces. But more importantly their vision and the talented team behind it reminded
  us again why we love working with digital health companies trying to innovate within
  healthcare.

  Recently [David Ahn reviewed PACT for iMedicalApps](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2014/11/health-app-pact-saves-hundreds-insurance/) and came away with the same gushing impression as us. He claims to have been using it for over three years with success!

  While David discusses more of the mechanics of the app itself, it's really the greater place in the healthcare landscape that ties together PACT's vision. Earlier Forbes wrote about how ["Pact Is First Health App To Become An Insurance Plan"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/14/pact-health-app-insurance-plan/).

  Keep rocking it, PACT!

    We think the words of our clients say more about Datica than our own. That's why when one of our clients has a challenge that Datica can meet and exceed we let them tell you about it.

    Mayank Thanawala, Vice-President of Research and Development for HealthLoop – a company that is tracking patient recovery and improving outcomes with its automated patient follow-up solution, talked recently about his experience with switching his present hosting company to Datica and what led to that decision.

    In the HealthLoop [customer testimonial](https://datica.com/customer/healthloop/), Thanawala speaks from the HealthLoop offices in Mountain View, California, about his team's challenge in finding a replacement hosting solution. The challenge? Find a more stable, secure and scalable infrastructure so that his team could focus less on compliance and spend more time concentrating on the company's innovative healthcare product. The solution? Datica.

    If you store, process, or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI), [let's chat about your compliance needs](https://datica.com/compliance/) and how Datica can help.

    Crossover is a fantastic company with a smart idea. Patient care is critical to the nation's health, but is evolving at ever-accelerating rates due to technology innovations. Crossover has found a smart way to bring premium patient care to prominent companies, thus not only seeking to make lives healthier, but to play a role in helping those companies grow. No doubt their services are helping those companies achieve even greater success by exposing their employees to on-site clinics, thus saving time.

    We're big fans of Crossover. Great job!
