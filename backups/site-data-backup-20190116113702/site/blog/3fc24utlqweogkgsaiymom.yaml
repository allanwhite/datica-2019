:summary: Dr. Naomi Fried shared her ideas on the differences in innovation between
  pharma and hospitals, and opportunities for digital health vendors in pharma.
:blog_lead: "Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare
  innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently,
  as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships,
  she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare
  professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the
  molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers.
  \n\nIn our [July, 2017 podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/naomi-fried-how-digital-health-companies-can-help-pharma-innovate/)
  Travis Good, MD interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences
  between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages
  digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways
  from the podcast. "
:post: "\n> A whole world of opportunity exists for startups to bring new digital
  ideas into the market. Digital health vendors should be seeking out pharma for expertise
  and advice and working with providers to get to patient populations and to bring
  these new ideas forward to us. - Dr. Naomi Fried, Founder and CEO, [Health Innovation
  Strategies](http://www.healthinnovationstrategies.com/)\n\n## Pharma companies are
  slower to innovate than hospitals \n\nInnovation centers are prevalent throughout
  today’s healthcare ecosystem. But when innovation at Pharma companies is compared
  to innovation at hospitals and large health systems, hospitals cross the finish
  line first. “When it comes to testing and implementing patient-facing innovations,
  particularly new digital health tools, I think providers generally move more quickly,”
  says Fried. “They are closer to the patient, with fewer regulatory barriers to navigate
  around. So they tend to be more likely to jump in and try things. I’d say when it
  comes to [digital health innovation](https://datica.com/innovation/) for patients,
  hospitals are probably actually a bit ahead of pharma.”\n\n## Digital health vendors
  and pharma should partner\n\nInnovation in the pharmaceutical industry is fueled
  by both internal development and the external development taking place in digital
  health startups across the globe. The fastest path to innovation is in the partnerships
  being developed between the two. “Digital health companies usually have specialized
  domain knowledge,” Fried comments. “Tech-savvy, entrepreneurial startups tend to
  have a consumer bent and are better at developing user experiences and consumer-oriented
  solutions than large pharma companies.”\n\n> Digital health startups generally move
  more quickly and often develop products in months rather than years, and they can
  also make changes quickly and respond to feedback they get.\n\nOn the flip side
  of the coin, pharma companies can help [digital health vendors](https://datica.com/dhsf/)
  get past some of the healthcare-specific hurdles to get their products to market
  faster. Fried explains, “Digital health startups can leverage and learn from pharma's
  well-established processes around healthcare industry-specific details. Those include
  things like CPT coding and thinking about payer reimbursement. They don't have to
  reinvent the wheel or invest heavily in developing regulatory expertise but really
  can look to a pharma partner who can help them leapfrog to where they are going.”\n\n“Where
  startups lack the infrastructure needed to reach customers and have trouble scaling
  up, this is something that pharmaceutical companies have done well. So I think that
  teaming up with pharmaceutical companies and tapping their extensive marketing infrastructures
  and distribution channels can really help digital startups get traction, much faster
  than they could if they were on their own.”\n\n## The three biggest opportunities
  for digital health products\n\nDr. Fried describes three areas within digital health
  patient care that improve value and have the potential to reduce costs.\n\n### 1.
  Medication adherence\n\nMedication adherence has a big effect on outcomes and is
  supported and driven by digital tools. “When patients are more compliant in taking
  their medications, the stakeholders — doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and payers
  — all benefit. I think medication adherence is one of the Holy Grails in healthcare.
  Getting patients to take their medications at the right time, with the right dosage
  for a condition can really save costs and improve patient outcomes,” explains Fried.\n\n###
  2. Digital diagnosis and prediction\n\nA cost savings to the system and better outcomes
  for the patients make diagnosis and prediction technology a winning opportunity
  for digital health vendors to explore.  Fried explains by example, “Prophylactically
  taking medication that will avoid an asthma attack may mean a patient takes more
  drugs at a certain time. But the net result is a lower cost for the overall episode
  or even no episode at all, avoiding expenses like a trip to the emergency department.”\n\n###
  3. Digiceuticals\n\nThese are digital therapies that treat a patient for a condition
  in addition to, or instead of, a traditional pharmaceutical solution. Fried says,
  “They can either be complementary to medication or they may even have the potential
  to substitute for medication. An example of a complementary digiceutical would be
  a pain management app that goes along with pain medication that a patient might
  take after surgery. This could result in the patient needing less medication or
  healing more quickly. An example of a substitute digiceutical is a treatment for
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kids could use these apps rather
  than taking a medication.”\n\n> I think digiceuticals will clearly drive improved
  outcomes and lower the cost of healthcare with digital health solutions that bring
  value in addition to medication. I think that the complementary and synergistic
  effects of digital health with medications are a net-win for patients, for pharma,
  and also for the payers.\n\nTune in for the entire podcast, [Naomi Fried, PhD —

  :summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive
    suite. Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health
    Resources.
  :blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
    but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
    from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the
    Chief Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description
    that's evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
  :post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All
    the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things
    that the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017,
    healthcare organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies
    around MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about
    [the evolving role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical
    Information Officer, and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas
    Health Resources, one of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery
    systems in the United States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt
    Texas Health Resources (THR), the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason
    many hospitals added a CMIO in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide
    push toward electronic health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation
    project was a huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction
    rating and its [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was
    the initial reason the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve
    the job definition of a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes
    far beyond EHR. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians,
    are things that the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:**
    Listen to the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the
    CMIO job is like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources
    has implemented the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved
    past stabilization, through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into
    the thick of the volume-based to value-based care transformation broadly taking
    place today. The CMIO's role is shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe
    roadmap going forward is driven by three major things: healthcare regulation,
    defining success as a healthcare organization, and effectively engaging physicians
    in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization is about improving the workflows,\"
    Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling up your sleeves and digging into specific
    and individual workflows and really optimizing those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively,
    THR has found the need to continually engage physicians in the optimization process.
    \"That entails workflow mapping and going back and redesigning care or redesigning
    the workflow, then doing some usability testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing
    that again. In fact, optimization is always a reimplementation of certain workflows,
    so you are just digging in a little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes
    a village\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability
    to collaborate with many different people, both inside and outside the organization.
    Dr. Saldana relies on a network of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how
    others solve similar problems. \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS,
    CHIME, or other forums to really connect with the people that I know are leaders
    in different areas.\" He also relies on industry organizations, like the American
    Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]), to get ideas and answers. I think
    it is important for a CMIO to get out there and not just stay cloistered within
    healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana added.\n\n## Bringing 2017
    into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in healthcare today and CMIOs
    are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for some of the newer technologies
    around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled payments and new digital health
    solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the platform that engages our patients
    and our providers and delivers the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal,\"
    said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about
    as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as they did with Meaningful Use, THR is
    planning to create a steering committee with multi-area representatives from both
    the technology and clinical sides of the fence. Dr. Saldana has this to say about
    MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for [MACRA][7].
    It's going to be how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.\"\n*
    **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare organizations today, minimizing
    risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New EMR workflows for patient
    engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary to provide patients
    with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part of improving value
    is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr. Saldana said, \"The
    point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can have an impact. Ordering
    for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will be critical for us
    as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n* **Investigating
    cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is looking into are
    in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n##
    Staying focused through it all – putting physicians first\n\nAfter spending thirty
    years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves as a representative voice
    of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency physicians get into informatics
    since there are a lot of parallels with emergency medicine and informatics in
    terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be avoided by having someone
    like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians. Dr. Saldana says a big
    part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the eyes of a physician,
    looking specifically at whether or not that new technology will make them more
    efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness to take on the
    burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the bridge between
    the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that
    we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.
    Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important for a CMIO.
    Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for an
    organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores innovation

  :summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as
    connected health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
  :blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is
    very often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica.com/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
    or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
    they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track
    an individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health
    is much more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality
    in today’s world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative
    strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day
    lives of people.
  :post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed
    Joe Kvedar, MD](https://datica.com/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President,
    Connected Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet
    of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/) which is packed with
    real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors
    drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been a proponent
    of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest HIT influencers
    in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems to be solved.
    Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable
    sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected health journey\nSome
    aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re only likely a
    few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health journey.
    Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1. **The
    future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
    is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
    prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
    offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
    is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
    it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
    already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr.
    Kvedar explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate
    that data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis
    will become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
    the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
    that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
    digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
    it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says.
    “The next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create
    a unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected
    health journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example,
    motivating them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting
    to happen today despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr.
    Kvedar says the business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance,
    United Health Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device.
    If they achieve three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that
    wearable device, they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome
    parts of the healthcare industry seem to embrace the connected health journey
    faster than others. “Companies like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking
    in wearables’ data and giving consumers something back in return. They are all
    seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of
    the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs and hospitals are used to
    making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't quite figured out
    how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward hospitals for
    keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges are happily
    being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability \nEven
    though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for consumers,
    there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area of interoperability.
    \ Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n \n- **Proprietary
    technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s financial best
    interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you are an IT vendor,
    almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom all the way down
    to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in and upsell you
    new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering
    their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep
    you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On the
    hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven by
    the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
    a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
    to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
    interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
    award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible
    way hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could
    conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government
    purchasers that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have
    a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump
    administration, but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world
    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and
    chronic illness management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing
    health technology devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic
    illnesses but also helping to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n-
    **Wearables provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't
    result in symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol,
    visceral fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't
    really, on a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context,
    you can think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables
    provide feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a
    Fitbit, for example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be
    motivated to walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always
    motivate a lifestyle change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation.
    “It turns out there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t
    care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
    person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback
    loop is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains.
    That could be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe
    continues, “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in
    the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is
    the Spire device that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory
    rate; it tells you whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe
    differently under different conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables
    market as data becomes more meaningful to people with insights rather than just
    numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians
    today are inundated with data, most of it today within the EHR. Clinicians spend
    too much time clicking, finding, charting, and checking boxes to document the
    in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard to imagine connected health
    data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy process. Dr. Kvedar suggests
    this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n \n1. **The current state:**
    Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr. Kvedar sees connected health
    in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We have quite a few examples of
    that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and a lot of our primary care
    practices are patient centers or medical homes as part of our population health
    management structure. In those practices, there is someone whose responsibility
    is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide that person
    with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that are either
    difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is not enough
    of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
    is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to
    get their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags
    the patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort
    through. Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something
    that really needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**
    \ Most industries today are already using intelligent analysis software and data
    science that creates meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data.
    Dr. Kvedar describes how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at
    the beginning of a new era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've
    been tracking their blood pressure for the last two months. We should be able
    to give you a dashboard view that shows what blood pressures are normal when they
    go up, why they go up. Do they go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do
    they go up after a meal? That would give you some real insight into how to care
    for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions that seeing this all become a reality
    with physicians is dependent on solving more than just the problems of data overload
    and dashboards. Here are two other important dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If
    you call it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds
    scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort
    of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration. Will that change? Not sure.
    Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by two years from now will be
    value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans are now doing this but
    the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason we did medical home
    across our system is because of value-based payments and it makes much more sense
    in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of AI.** “On the one hand,
    we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call it decision support,
    maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you
    are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how you frame it. And,
    of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that and how you convince
    docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going to get sued because
    there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right in the algorithm.”
    \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The pieces of connected
    health are here today, but we still have to put them together. Some of that will
    be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is even societal.”\n\nMake

  :summary: The fundamental problem of medication adherence is that consumers don't
    do what they're supposed to, or what we think is the logical thing to do.
  :blog_lead: 'In business school, as we discussed the problems of accurate forecasting,
    one of my professors joked that "the fundamental problem is that consumers don''t
    buy what they''re supposed to." In a way, the problem of medication adherence
    is just that, patients don''t do what they''re supposed to do, or what we think
    is the logical thing to do. There are various reasons for this of course, ranging
    from the inability to purchase medications, physical disability, complicated medication
    regimens, real or perceived side effects, and so on. Lack of medication adherence
    has a significant cost associated with it as well causing it to be also called
    **America''s other drug problem**. And therein lie the challenge and the opportunity
    - how do you get patients to do what they''re supposed to, given their constraints?

'
  :post: "## Is this really that big a problem?\n\nIn the US, at least 50% of the
    population (133 million people) live with at least one chronic condition [1].
    Since lack of medication adherence invariably leads to problems such as unnecessary
    disease progression, disease complications, reduced functional abilities, a lower
    quality of life, and even premature death, poor adherence has been estimated to
    cost up to $177 billion annually in total direct and indirect health care costs.
    In a more recent report by the IMS Institute on avoidable healthcare costs in
    the U.S., it was demonstrated that six disease areas (congestive heart failure,
    HIV, osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia) accounted
    for $105 billion in annual avoidable costs from non-adherence to medication treatment.\n\nAnd
    this is not just a US only problem - the WHO estimates that, on a worldwide basis,
    only about 50 percent of patients typically take their medicines as prescribed.\n\n##
    A closer look at the cost-benefits of medication adherence\n\nMultiple studies
    have confirmed the benefits of medication adherence including the ones listed
    earlier. A rigorous study was conducted recently looking at cost data by condition.
    That study calculated average annual medical savings, per patient annually, of
    $8, 881 in congestive heart failure, $4, 337 in hypertension, $4, 413 in diabetes,
    and $1, 860 in dyslipidemia. These savings were after offsetting for the increased
    pharmacy spend associated with being adherent; the increased pharmacy spend is
    because increased adherence means more medications purchased. [This](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/121/12/1455)
    study showed that those who filled none of their discharge prescriptions within
    120 days after myocardial infarction (MI) had an 80% increased chance of death
    and those who filled only some of their prescriptions had a 44% increased chance
    of death compared with those who filled the majority of their prescriptions.\n\nAll
    of which begs the questions - if the value (cost, health, life, quality of life)
    is clear, why does this problem exist at all? And why is this problem so incredibly
    prevalent?\n\n## Root causes of non-adherence\n\nThe causes of non-adherence are
    complex, and multifactorial. Non-adherence is broken down into two types:\n\n1.
    - Primary non-adherence i.e. not initially filling the prescription written;\n2.
    - Secondary non-adherence i.e. not taking as prescribed or not refilling the prescription.\n\nNet
    net, the reasons for non-adherence can be traced back to multiple root causes
    but the ones that are addressable are as follows:\n\n- **Better patient education**:
    Medication regimens for the more chronic diseases (which invariably present with
    additional co-morbidities) are complicated. A prescription for a complex MI patient
    could include aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, atorvastatin, spironolactone, furosemide,
    potassium, sublingual nitroglycerin and clopidogrel. And these medications can,
    and often do, change. Expecting older patients and those with language barriers
    to understand, remember and take these medications on time (2 of this one, 1 of
    that one, and 1 of this other one but before lunch and the others after meals
    and at night) is unrealistic.\n- **Motivation or rather lack of immediate gratification
    / feedback**: Drugs often don't manifest an immediately visible benefit. For example,
    the use of antihypertensive agents in asymptomatic patients may be perceived by
    a patient as not providing benefit because they simply do not feel better as drugs
    often address an underlying problem and not necessarily the symptoms. Additionally,
    antihypertensives have side effects, many of which are immediately experienced
    by patients.\n\nSo how does one go about addressing this problem? The real challenge
    is the need for someone to have an \"a-ha\" moment. Multiple approaches have been
    tried as described below, with varying success. Even in cases where a certain
    approach has shown promise, the problem still seems to be one of user adoption
    and sustained adherence (there's some irony for you).\n\n## Approaches to improve
    medication adherence\n\n### Analytics\n\n[Data in healthcare](https://datica.com/blog/data-security-patient-engagement/)
    is not, and to some extent cannot, be shared easily. This makes discovering patterns
    in data and mining data difficult since the data required to truly understand
    medication adherence comes from multiple sources and is in multiple formats. So
    analytics on medication adherence requires the following sets of data - each of
    which is owned by a different entity.\n\n- The prescription: The entire flow is
    triggered when a physician writes an Rx (there are steps prior to this such a
    pre-auth etc. but is skipped for simplicity). See here for a summary [view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electronic_Prescribing,
    _How_it_works.jpeg) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_prescribing)
    for a deep dive. These e-prescriptions flow from the EMR to the pharmacy via SureScripts.\n-
    The prescription fill: A patient picks up an Rx. The Rx fill information is communicated
    at a summary level to SureScripts and the details are shared with Rx fill aggregators
    like Argus. Aggregators in turn share with this data with your health plan etc.\n\nGiven
    these two sets of disparate data, analytics is difficult but you can imagine triggers
    such as:\n\n- Rx has not been filled after X days (of being written or procedure
    or discharge, etc.);\n- Rx has not been refilled;\n- Rx refill is due (based on
    Rx dosage and amount dispensed).\n\nUnifying and analyzing this data is made more
    difficult because of the associated challenges of uniquely identifying an individual
    across these data domains. Unification of these data sources is doable, but it
    presents additional challenges.\n\nExpect to see advances with big data analytics
    in this area. Health plans are ideally situated to make inroads here given their
    access to most of these datasets. Population heath management vendors are also
    investing a lot in analytics here as this is an area where all players (including
    the deep pocketed) are very interested in. This approach still needs a \"last
    mile\" solution i.e. a direct patient touchpoint which brings us to...\n\n###
    Devices\n\nThis approach, attempted several times, uses a combination of physical
    devices at a patient home, some form of wireless communication, and visual or
    messaging cues to remind patients, or remote caregivers, to take their medication.
    [Vitality GlowCaps](http://www.vitality.net/index.html) is the one that comes
    to mind right away. [Their study](http://www.vitality.net/research_betaresults.html)
    indicated significant improvement in adherence. But (yes, there's always a \"but\"
    in healthcare.. ) the challenge to a large extent here is that for this approach
    to work well, pharmacies must be fully involved in the process. Pharmacies need
    to enter the Rx data into the \"alerting\" backend provided. I'm sure this process
    can be automated but that data needs to then be synced with the caps, and we have
    to hope that the patient doesn't mix up the caps. In the case of Vitality, the
    extra work required at the pharmacy was funded by pharma companies.\n\nThe newer
    entrant in this space is [AdhereTech](http://adheretech.com/), which has been
    getting lots of good press. AdhereTech is an entire bottle, and not just the bottle
    top. It also uses messaging and automated phone calls increase adherence.\n\nIt
    would be interesting to see some combination of analytics and device that could
    leverage the data being created in the Rx and use that to programmatically update
    and keep the device in sync.\n\nA device centric approach (in conjunction with
    communications initiated by the device or data captured by the device) can go
    a long way towards addressing the challenges around improving patient education
    and reminders. However, it still doesn't (IMHO) address the core problem of instant
    feedback / gratification / motivation.\n\n### Apps\n\nWe all know that mobile
    will play a significant role in healthcare in the coming years. However, most
    apps in the various app stores are rudimentary (primarily in our opinion due to
    lack of knowledge, fear of compliance and lack of real / test data - all of which
    (shameless plug) are the reasons that we founded [Datica](https://datica.com/).
    There are about 200 apps in the app store focused on filling prescriptions and
    another 225 apps focused on compliance/adherence. This is a pretty small number
    considering the potential benefits and value. Apps in this category include those
    provided by CVS, Walgreens, Medicine Reminders (HD), Medisafe, MedCoach and DoseCast.
    Even though the app revenue itself might not be significant, there are substantial
    revenue opportunities to be explored around data analytics, Rx refills, refill
    redirection to mail order and so on. Companies like Walgreens have already made
    mobile app acquisitions. Walgreens acquired RxMindMe.\n\nThis is an area waiting
    for a solution - one which addresses both reminders (with ideally minimal patient
    data entry) and motivation / gratification (gamification). This is an area that
    we at Catalyze are very interested in as well and are working to address developer
    challenges around compliance, data access (real and test data), and appropriate
    APIs. Look for more from us on this soon.\n\n### Smart Pills\n\nThis is the holy
    grail. The technology involves the incorporating an ingestible sensor (about the
    size of grain of sand) into the pill (or whatever form). The patient then ingests
    it. The sensor can wirelessly communicate with a patch worn on the patient's skin
    which, in turn sends the information out via wifi. The technology can definitively
    determine when medications have been ingested, and can provide this information
    wirelessly, securely and confidentially, to patients and designated caregivers,
    health providers, and researchers. This data can be used to address the motivation
    **and** the reminder aspects of adherence. Not to mention that it is **actual**
    consumption data (opening a cap or tapping a button is not the same as **knowing**
    the pill has been taken).\n\nThis data in conjunction with Rx data can go a very
    long way in making medication adherence an addressable problem. It does require
    pharmaceutical company buy in but given the value and the opportunity and the
    passive nature of the device and data collection, it should have significant uptake
    quickly. Company to watch? [Proteus](http://www.proteus.com/).\n\n## So, the summary?\n\n**Why
    do it?** - Money: very conservatively, $105 billion problem * 0.01% = $10, 500,
    000 (annual) - Social impact: population health improvement, reduced spend on
    healthcare emergencies and so on as described earlier\n\n**What technologies to
    explore?** - Mobile: everyone has at least one of these devices. Also look to
    SMS as a communication mechanism - Data analytics: what blog post would be complete
    without at least one reference to big data? But, on a serious note, the problem
    is one of scale as well and drawing intelligent conclusions and predictive insights
    based on Rx, claims, fills, disease and compliance is challenging.\n\nWe, at Datica,
    are very interested and passionate about this area and do know a few things about
    the space and its associated challenges. If you have an idea and are looking to
    understand more about data, data source, app ideas, APIs, drop us a line. "

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
