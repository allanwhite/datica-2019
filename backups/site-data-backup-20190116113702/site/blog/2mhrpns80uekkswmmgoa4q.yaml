:summary: 'Innovation in healthcare starts with the reputable intent to promote optimal
  quality and value of care to patients, providers, insurers, and employers. A few
  macro level initiatives of innovation include being able to scale the business by
  creating constant opportunity, shifting from a fee-for-service model, managing cost
  of care, and providing a framework needed to support the operational and legal backends.
  These innovative measures face many challenges though. The core two being: 1) Managing
  the total cost of care budgets by managing risk contracts and delivering the right
  care at the right time; and 2) Improving quality while effectively earning revenue.'

:post: "Even today’s healthcare technology has challenges to effectively assist in
  innovation. There are intrinsic complexities of sharing data in a system of minimal
  interoperability, such as the limitations in progressing information through the
  care process. Clinical integration also becomes a matter in question when limited
  access to data (EHRs) is provided, the user experience for care management is incommodious,
  or there is inadequate access to the claims data. \n\nWith these limitations on
  the business and technology factions of healthcare systems, there are new **call
  to actions (CTA)** that healthcare innovation and new technologies are aiming to
  solve.\n\n### CTA #1: An ACO care record that advances with patients to their care
  destination.\nHealthcare systems mandate a fully integrated health information environment
  that can be accessible across the comprehensive care continuum. This requires a
  connected ACO community that surpasses the mere needs of interoperability and necessitates
  a cloud-based health insurance exchange for complete data capture of the patient
  experience regardless of the site of care. \n\n### CTA #2: All-inclusive physician
  performance coverage.\nPhysicians and healthcare providers are immersed in patient
  care but cannot do it all on their own. Physicians are seeking a reporting system
  that can show performance metrics, high-risk patients, coding improvements, prescription
  status, patient rosters, gaps in care, and predictive analysis to suggest interventions.
