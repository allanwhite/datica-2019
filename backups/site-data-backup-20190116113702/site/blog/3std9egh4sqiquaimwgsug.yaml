    Mohan is an engineer by training, passionate about healthcare, data and technology. He is a firm believer in “connecting the dots.” He co-founded Datica with Travis to help bring change to healthcare, and spent four years guiding the company before moving onto new opportunities.

    Before founding Datica, Mohan worked within supply chain management and master data management. After securing degrees from IIT Bombay and University of Pennsylvania, he worked with Fortune 100 companies developing solutions for their supply chain and data management needs. From there, he applied lessons learned to healthcare at US Oncology (now part of McKesson) and Net.Orange (now part of NantHealth).

    Mohan moved into multi-platform development after seeing first-hand the challenges of an emerging mobile economy. He is a YCombinator Summer 2012 alum. He has presented at various HIMSS and AHIP sessions, and is a noted speaker about compliance at healthcare events.

:summary: The healthcare sector is overwhelmingly transitioning to a digital and mobile
  focused industry but that continuum can be broken down into 4 categories.
:blog_lead: 'Mobile health applications, wearable technology, and remote patient monitoring
  devices all present exemplary options for meeting patient engagement goals. Since
  HITECH passed in 2009, more providers have narrowed their focus on improving patient
  engagement in their practices, especially since meaningful use requires patients
  to view, download, and access their health information. All of these solutions can
  help minimize costs and increase improved care results, but the leaders in the industry
  recognize that increased patient engagement and maximized interoperability will
  most likely be the ultimate solution for long-term sustainability of the advantages
  seen.

'
:post: "Because individuals are becoming more active participants in their personal
  care, patient engagement is on the rise. You can see shared decision making between
  providers and patients, stimulating conversations and allowing patients to select
  preferable treatments. By directing patients to pay greater attention to their medical
  needs, care coordination is improved between hospital visits, and mismanagement
  healthcare costs are reduced overall. \n\nHealthcare IT systems and various other
  technologies will contribute to more compelling patient engagement. As more developers
  emphasize improving interoperability throughout the healthcare industry, medical
  providers are better aligning their resources to suit the patient’s medical needs.
  A myriad of channels are being productized to increase communication between clinicians
  and patients, such as secure patient portals and compliant messaging platforms.\n\nThe
  healthcare sector is overwhelmingly transitioning to a digital and mobile focused
  industry but that continuum can be broken down into four categories:\n\n1. Health,
  fitness and wellbeing\n2. Self-diagnostics\n3. Acute condition management\n4. Chronic
  condition management\n\nEach of these can be supported by different mobile technologies
  but all inclusive access to the care these categories address cannot be achieved
  in an environment without interoperability. Interoperability is mandatory to facilitate
  a more comprehensive data exchange. \n\nPatients will always be at a disadvantage
  by the deficiency of interoperability, so that is why there has been an increased
  focus and awareness on developing new interoperable tools for the consumer market
  as of late. There are certain focuses that need to be addressed as they are proving
  to be challenges, such as how the new market isn’t conducive to the free flow of
  health data that would permit patients to take control of their care. With that
  said, the new pivot needs to be on convincing clinicians to share information and
  include patient-reported data in the constant flow of information that will allow
  real-time access to care.\n\nIf you want to read about how Datica was able to contribute
  to the Department of Veteran Affairs increasing patient engagement, check out our
  [new case study](/customer/veterans-affairs/).\n\n"
