  triple aim — lower costs, better outcomes, better experience — then this book it
  is for you.
:blog_lead: I'm thrilled to share the final version of our book, _Complete Cloud Compliance_
  with you all.
:post: "The book makes an ideal holiday gift for friends and family who need to learn
  how healthcare data and compliance in a post-cloud world will empower digital transformation
  in the biggest industry in the world.\U0001F609\n\n<a href=\"https://www.completecloudcompliance.com/\"

  width=\"150\" /></a>\n\nAll copies of the book will be sold *at-cost*. That means
  we are making zero profit via these retailers. The decision was pretty straight-forward
  for us: The ideas in this book are meant to be shared in order to help advance digital
  health success, and not meant to make money. Long-time followers of Datica (and
  Catalyze, our first incarnation) will know that [transparency](https://datica.com/open-source)
  and a sincere desire for [your success](https://datica.com/dhsf) are our [central
  tenets](https://datica.com/about).\n\nBack when we started the process of writing
  a book, we knew little about publishing. It is a fascinating world. Ultimately,
  we elected to go with an on-demand publisher; [Blurb](https://blurb.com) proved
  to be the best quality. We went this route because we knew content iterations were
  going to be a key to releasing a final version worthy of the healthcare community.
  It worked as planned—once the \"first draft\" was printed in September, we went
  through two more drafts as we collected feedback from friends and industry experts,
  including the CSPs and the HITRUST Alliance itself. The eventual \"final version\"
  being sold through online retailers is what we have been calling \"v1.2\" and is
  much improved from the first September publication — well over 200 different edits.
  We are eternally grateful for the feedback we received over the last several months,
  especially from Dr. Bryan Cline of the HITRUST Alliance, and  Hector Rodriguez,
  Microsoft Worldwide Healthcare CISO, who wrote the foreword.\n\nBecause we went
  with an on-demand publisher, the prices listed are the actual cost of one-off prints
  for both hardcover (directly via Blurb itself) and softcover (via Amazon and B&N).
  Datica wasn't in a position to purchase 10,000 copies via an offset printer and
  then manage warehouse distribution, so this balance was worth it. If anyone is curious
  to learn more about the self-publishing game, feel free to email me at [kris@datica.com](mailto:kris@datica.com).\n\nWe
  love feedback. For those who buy the book, please let us know what you think! I'm
  always happy to receive an email or take a phone call. I envision a \"v1.3\" being
  released later next year after enough feedback has rolled in.\n\n<img class=\"lozad\"

  />\n\n\n## Why you must read this book\n\nIf you are interested in making healthcare
  better by enabling the industry’s triple aim — lower costs, better outcomes, better
  experience — then this book it is for you. Whether you’re an entrepreneur just starting
  out or you are a part of a large organization that wants to compete in the rapidly
  emerging new world order of data driven healthcare, this book will give you a framework
  and approach to unblocking the cloud and ultimately provide you and your organization
  a path to digital transformation.\n\nThe biggest challenge for healthcare workloads
  on the cloud comes down to confusion between engineers and compliance officers.
  Many engineers don't have full command of [how compliance *really* works](https://datica.com/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/),
  or how to visualize the path to attaining compliance. Meanwhile, most compliance
  officers lack the engineering depth to keep pace with the rapid changes in the world
  of cloud technology—so are unsure how to successfully leverage the cloud in their
  programs.\n\nThe result are a lot of engineering teams who think they are compliant,
  but they aren't, and will find out to their detriment when they undergo risk assessments
  and audits. Or, we find compliance officers who are unsure of the cloud enough that
  they bar it from internal adoption. Both cases are not advancing the success of
  digital health.\n\nThe book is written to bridge that divide.\n\nEngineers will
  be taught the fundamentals of compliance so that they will be true experts by the
  end of the 112 pages. Compliance owners will be taught the basics of the cloud (and
  post-cloud world) so that they can feel confident enacting an internal compliance
  program that empowers the cloud.\n\nThank you for giving the book a chance, and
  for giving it a read!\n\n_[Complete Cloud Compliance](https://www.completecloudcompliance.com/)_
  is available now in softcover and hardcover."

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\n*
    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"
    markdown=\"1\">\n\n### PHI Resources\n\n* [Learn more about PHI](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)\n*

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
