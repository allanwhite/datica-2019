:summary: Nowadays in the healthcare industry everyone must be aware of their roles
  in regards to data privacy and security because accountability risk from consumers,

:post: "The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights is conducting
  these audits and, according to recent reports, business associates affected by a
  data breach face average fine costs of $1 million. You read that correctly but let
  me repeat to ensure clarity. Average of $1 million. With that said, no matter if
  your business is massive or minor or how far segmented you feel from direct patient
  care, responsibilities must be clarified on how to handle protected health information
  (PHI) so you do not face these fines.\n\nBusiness associates have governed regulations
  for the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules of HIPAA and the HITECH
  Act. A [Business Associate Agreement](/academy/business-associate-agreements) states
  and clarifies work with your covered entity, especially in regards to the Breach
  Notification Rule (timeframe, context, and financial liability responsibilities).
  And, as of last year, all covered entities are mandated to have these agreements
  between their business associates and those business associates with their subcontractors,
  and this will be one of the core criteria that auditors will be looking for in healthcare
  organizations over the coming years.\n\n### So what does Datica do well as a business
  associate and subcontractor?\nHIPAA requires three different safeguards for PHI
  to be enacted, in addition to the business associate agreements. We feel we have
  mastered these core safeguards as a business associate so our covered entities never
  have to fear a breach on our ends. \n\n#### 1. Administrative\nThese safeguards
  are inclusive of performing a risk analysis to understand what PHI you have, how
  it is utilized, where it is vulnerable, and what potential impacts could be if exposed.
  Policies and procedures should be founded from this risk analysis.\n\n#### 2. Technical\nThese
  are integrated into your internal IT procedures and systems. These are inclusive
  of ones that you have outsourced to vendors.\n\n#### 3. Physical\nThese will limit
  access to PHI and data storage areas to solely authorized workers on a necessity
  basis.\n\nIf you are a new or small organization, as many are, you most likely are
  not a HIPAA expert or have one on your staff. In our opinion, the best place to
  start is by performing a risk analysis and determine your weak points and concentrate
  your efforts to cover those critical areas.\n\n"
