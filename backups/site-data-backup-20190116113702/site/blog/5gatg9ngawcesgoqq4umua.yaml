  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou

    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Healthâ€”The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong

:summary: Healthcare is completely different from any other industry so is it possible
  to take everyday shortcuts to achieve the desired entrepreneurial results? If you
  ask one of the latest  Silicon Valley sweethearts, Zenefits, as of late, the answer
  is an astounding no. As Zenefits' COO David Sacks states, "Compliance is like oxygen.
  Without it, we die." With the immediate resignation of Parker Conrad, former Zenefits'
  CEO, we will see if Zenefits' will be given the kiss of life as compliance becomes
  a newly adopted core pillar to the organization.
:blog_lead: Healthcare is completely different from any other industry so is it possible
  to take everyday shortcuts to achieve the desired entrepreneurial results? If you
  ask one of the latest  Silicon Valley sweethearts, [Zenefits][1], as of late, the
  answer is an astounding no. As Zenefits' COO [David Sacks][2] states, "Compliance
  is like oxygen. Without it, we die." With the immediate resignation of [Parker Conrad][3],
  former Zenefits' CEO, we will see if Zenefits' will be given the kiss of life as
  compliance becomes a newly adopted core pillar to the organization.

  As of earlier this month, [BuzzFeed][4] released a [report][5] that discovered over eigthy percent of the Zenefits insurance deals in just Washington through at least August 2015 were sold by unlicensed brokers. Along with Washington, there is evidence of similar behaviors in at least seven other states, dating back all the way to summer of 2014. With this event just adding salt to the wound after a shaky financial year for Zenefits, further devaluation can be anticipated from the already 48% decrease the company faced in 2015.

  When all is said and done, the biggest risk shown is the relationship Zenefits has with the various state insurance companies. The multitude of policies that corresponded to unlicensed employees were backed by major insurance providers, including Blue Cross, United HealthCare and Aetna. The clients of Zenefits don't have to worry too much about these policies going away, as many legal professionals are currently stating. This issue is going to fall between these unlicensed agents and the insurance companies as to how these violations will be handled.

  One thing that can be taken away from Zenefits' misconduct is the ever-important need for compliance. Compliance is not just another checkbox to-do item. Compliance must be ingrained in an organization's culture even when not on top of mind. Thankfully, that's where Datica comes in. More than just ensuring out customer's complete compliance, we become a partner to every single one of them. We believe in an improved healthcare and will do whatever it takes to make that a reality.
