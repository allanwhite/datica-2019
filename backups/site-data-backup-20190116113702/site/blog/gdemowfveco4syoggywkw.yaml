  health landscape in our [Mapping the Digital Health Landscape blog series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/)
  where we interview other entrepreneurs who, like us, use technology to help healthcare
  organizations better serve their patients. \n\nThis week’s interview is with Drew
  Schiller, CEO & Co-Founder of [Validic](https://validic.com/), makers of a sophisticated
  health data platform whose mission is to “improve the quality of human life by building
  technology that makes personal data actionable.” Since 2010, Validic has connected
  millions of people around the world with their healthcare and wellness programs. "
:post: "\n> Our expectations over the last 10 to 15 years have completely changed
  in terms of how we actually interface with the digital world around us.”\n\n\n##
  Q & A with Drew Schiller\n\n### When you think of digital health, what comes to
  mind? \n\nThe definition can be pretty wide-ranging and all-encompassing. Personally,
  when I think of digital health, I see it through the lens of the consumerization
  of health. It speaks to the consumerization of how healthcare is accessed by patients,
  but it's also the consumerization of how healthcare providers and practitioners
  interface with technology. It’s important to remember that practitioners are also
  daily consumers of technology. And so, our expectations over the last 10 to 15 years
  have completely changed in terms of how we actually interface with the digital world
  around us. \n\nThink back to 20 years ago when the paradigm of listening to music
  was to go to the record store and buy a piece of plastic, then put that piece of
  plastic into a player that was designed specifically to play that thing. Even though
  it was digital music, it was very analog in terms of how that process actually worked.
  \n\nWhereas today, when you want to listen to music, all you have to do is Google
  it, listen on YouTube, or even ask your Amazon Echo to play the song. It's all at
  your fingertips. Any piece of music that you want to listen to in the world right
  now is readily accessible to you. I think that's the general expectation people
  have for how they interface with technology in general, right? When you want to
  speak with somebody — one of your friends, for example — you can text,  call, FaceTime,
  message them on Facebook, or tweet at them. You can use myriad different messaging
  tools in order to reach out to peers or friends. \n\nI think we're seeing a similar
  expectation — that consumer expectation of always being connected, always on, with
  multi-faceted domains for communication — being applied to healthcare, which is
  still today a very static industry focused on singular channels that are embedded
  in the system. And, that's why digital health is a concept that's so disruptive.
  I mean, we’re going from electronic health record systems that were designed to
  be digital filing cabinets, with improved billing and some improved data aggregation
  services, to a world where patients are expecting to not only be able to pay their
  hospital bills from their phone, but to schedule appointments, reach out to their
  doctors, and be educated on a condition. In addition, we also have new expectations
  around how our data is used in all aspects of our lives. \n\n### So how will we
  measure that digital health is improving people's lives and making people more healthy,
  or making people recover faster?\n\nWe're already starting to see measurable improvements.
  What we're missing is the integration of technical and operational components in
  such a way that clinicians and care managers can interface with the data the way
  they expect as digital consumers. For clinicians and care managers, this means the
  data are in their workflow in a way that's seamless and expected. Oftentimes in
  healthcare, we forget the care team members themselves are consumers of this data.
  It's not just the patients that are consumers. So, we need to develop technology
  and user experiences for both sides that enable patients and care managers to take
  the data, make meaning of it, and take action on it. \n\n### How do changing demographics
  impact digital health progress?\n\nAs digital natives enter high school and college,
  millennials begin to age, and baby boomers approach retirement, healthcare is shifting
  toward having a more technologically-savvy consumer base. That is universally true.
  I don't think it's specific to any one particular age profile. I mean, I just FaceTimed
  with my 87-year-old grandparents on my grandfather's iPhone the other day. My grandmother
  refuses to touch an iPhone. She says that she's kind of a little bit of a technophobe.
  She does do email pretty well, but she's a little bit of a technophobe. \n\nBut
  my grandfather, he's a technophile, right? I mean, they're both 87, and he's totally
  fine with  FaceTime; he loves it, he gets it, he texts. So, I think it's a little
  bit individualistic as well. One truth that is often lost in healthcare is that
  technology is not supposed to be a burden. Think about the internal combustion engine
  of a car. If it was more of a pain to drive a car than it was to ride a horse, we
  never would have shifted toward pretty much exclusively driving cars, right? If
  it was easier to continue using a typewriter than it was to use a computer, we would
  have never switched to using computers. And early on, it was easier to use a typewriter
  than a computer, right? \n \nWe need to make digital health technology so easy to
  use and so seamless in terms of how we interface with it in our daily lives, that
  it's easier than any alternative. We should be able to do this pretty easily by
  applying very simple, straight-forward design thinking to how we implement and integrate
  the technology. \n\n### What are the hurdles that we still have to navigate?\n\nCandidly,
  one of the biggest hurdles is the payment models inside healthcare.\n\nFundamentally
  speaking, the folks who are actually paying for healthcare are not directly the
  patients or the providers. It's generally the employers who are paying on behalf
  of the patients, or it's the payers who are operating as the third-party benefit
  administrators.\n\nWith some of the new payment mechanisms, like alternative payment
  models (APMs), we're starting to see providers take on more risk. Because they have
  financial incentives and are actually seeing improved outcomes, we're going to see
  providers put in place streamlined, efficient, easy to use, and well-communicative
  technology.\n\n### What is digital health going to look like five or ten years from
  now? \n\nSome of the core principles will remain the same; we will still have a
  largely decentralized healthcare system that is slightly more consolidated but still
  varied across the country. In other words, we'll still have thousands of health
  systems, dozens of payers, dozens of pharmaceutical companies, and a siloed electronic
  health record system. I think all those things will still probably be true in ten
  years, but I think the big difference will be the data. There will be incentives
  for each of those stakeholders to make the patient experience such that data will
  flow much more efficiently within those systems.  \n\nIn other words, a patient
  within a particular provider network will have a more holistic and cohesive experience
  with their provider. Communication will be easier. Data, whether it's their wearable
  or sensors on their phone or from devices that they're using in the home, will be
  able to flow freely between disparate systems. And, there won't be a marked difference
  between data that I'm collecting on my blood pressure monitor at home or my wearable
  on my wrist, versus data that is collected from the blood pressure cuff when I'm
  in the doctor for my annual physical.  \n\nThe sharing of data is going to be vastly
  improved. Any data that I collect pertaining to my health, whether it's psychological
  data, phenotypic data, potentially environmental data, as well as medical data,
  lab data, etc., will all go into a centralized repository where my clinicians and
  physicians can access it at the ready. This is the future of healthcare. \n\n"

    width=\"150\" class=\"float-right\" alt=\"OhMD\">\n\nMy company is OhMD. My brother
    Nate and I co-founded it a few years back to try to address communication problems
    in healthcare that hadn’t been solved. It’s a secure texting solution that addresses
    two major pain points. We started with patient communication. How do we replace
    the voicemails and phone tag and general lack of access that patients have to
    their doctors and care teams? The other pain point is around physician to physician
    or provider to provider communications. We set out to build a consumer-grade,
    HIPAA compliant texting app that improves efficiency for providers. We really
    took a very consumer tech approach to solving this problem and really focus on
    user experience and eliminating friction. We’re building a big user base of providers
    and staff that need OhMD to efficiently get through the day. As far as patients
    go, we believe access and communication is a critical component of healthcare.
    With a simple mechanism to communicate with patients between visits, we are measurably
    improving outcomes.\n\n## Where is digital health at on its own industry maturity
    curve? \n\nI have my own unique perspective on where we're at based on where I've
    been in my career. I've spent the last 13 years of my life doing electronic health
    record implementation consulting, interface writing, integrations, and building
    custom solutions for some of the biggest health systems in the country. Everyone
    involved in implementing EHRs was doing it with the understanding that we would
    of being able to use this data to really improve outcomes, and ultimately make
    doctors more efficient at the same time. We are just on the cusp of starting to
    actually do that, so I would say that to me, we're really just beginning of the
    second phase of health IT in that we can actually use the data that help us improve
    patient outcomes. Up until now, it's really just been about implementing software,
    digitizing the data, and the really exciting stuff is where we go from here. How
    do we automate processes? How do we improve outcomes? And how do we do all that
    while making providers more efficient? That's the good stuff.\n\n## What are the
    biggest hurdles, do you think, to real transformation? \n\nIt seems like the biggest
    hurdle we need to overcome is interoperability of patient health data. Health
    data is very siloed which makes innovation more challenging than it has to be.
    The good news is that we're starting to see the big consumer tech companies focus
    on the interoperability problem. Apple is already showing how they can put the
    patient in charge of their own data by delivering it to their iPhone. We're just
    starting to address the real crux of the interoperability problem, trying to put
    together solutions that allow data to move more seamlessly. I really think that's
    the biggest barrier to making really impactful change in health care is figuring
    out how to move data efficiently. \n\n## What are the innovations you're most
    excited about, other than what your company does?\n\nI think there's a huge opportunity
    to use technology to help doctors address the things that they spend a lot of
    time doing that aren't seeing patients. Something like two-thirds of a doctor's
    time are spent doing administrative tasks or documenting patient visits. Google
    is even starting to use machine learning to try to predict when you’re going to
    get sick. Leveraging artificial intelligent, automation, and machine learning
    to address administrative work and simple clinical cases so that doctors can focus
    on complicated cases and really spend more time with patients is the stuff that
    really excites me. \n\nSubscribe to the Datica blog on the right to get the continued

    Find out in the 3rd issue of “Mapping Digital Health” with Dr. John Moore of Twine
    Health.
  :blog_lead: What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about healthcare today?
    As the third in our [Mapping Digital Health](/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/)
    series of interviews, we asked [Dr. John Moore](https://www.twinehealth.com/john-moore),
    CEO and Founder of Twine Health, about the status of patient engagement in healthcare.
    Moore’s entrepreneurial career had an unusual start when, as an undergrad at Boston
    University, he founded a breakdancing club. As he completed medical school and
    trained to become a specialized eye surgeon, he recognized a major break in communication
    between patients and their doctors once they left their doctor’s offices. Moore
    founded [Twine Health](https://www.twinehealth.com) in order to create technology
    that really reaches patients.
  :post: |-
    > Not surprisingly, when people are put into the driver's seat in their care, supported by doctors, nurses, health coaches, and others, their outcomes dramatically improve and the satisfaction of all parties soars.”

    ## Q&A with Dr. John Moore

    ### What kind of impact is patient engagement making in healthcare?

    The term patient engagement has become quite diluted over the past decade such that, lately, it typically refers simply to sending out e-mail appointment reminders and surveys and getting patients to sign up for patient portals to get them to do what their clinicians say. In this respect, the impact is relatively slim. At the same time, there is a transformative approach growing that we prefer to call "health activation," which is incredibly exciting and is proving to have a larger impact every day. The likes of Omada Health, [Propeller Health](/customer/propeller/), [HealthLoop](/customer/healthloop/), Twine Health, and others are working on solutions to help people truly collaborate with their care teams and to become activated in their own health behavior change. Not surprisingly, when people are put into the driver's seat in their care, supported by doctors, nurses, health coaches, and others, their outcomes dramatically improve and the satisfaction of all parties soars. There is still a long way to go to scale this phenomenon, but this progress makes it an exciting time to be in healthcare.

    <figcaption>Dr. Moore attended Boston University, where he studied biomedical engineering and also founded the BU breakdancing club.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    ### Is the "consumerization of patient care" making patient engagement easier? better?

    There is no doubt that freeing care from the shackles of our current fee-for-service insurance payment system makes empowering people to participate more deeply in their care easier and better. When doctors only get paid to see people in the office and hurry them through, there isn't much space for collaboration. A great example of the consumerization of care is the direct primary care movement in this county. Clinicians, especially in primary and preventative care, are fed up with the broken payment model and its unbearable administrative burden. And people are fed up with co-pays, deductibles, and terrible customer service. They are turning to direct primary care, a subscription-based model of primary care that brings the consumer directly to the clinician without insurance processes and other barriers. These practices get back to the basics of healthy therapeutic relationships and, by being unfettered from archaic payment models, they are free to adopt new workflows and technologies to further enhance the experience and to optimize health activation.

    In parallel with this consumerization effort, it is incredibly important to consider the world of workplace health that is paving the path ahead of consumerization and is about to boom. Self-insured employers, which make up more than 70% of those companies with greater than 500 employees, are tired of seeing rising healthcare cost by relying on the mainstream healthcare system. They are contracting with a new breed of healthcare providers that are building on-site primary care clinics and bringing health coaches to the office and to employee smart phones. While it might take consumers a while to start paying out of pocket for healthcare services, their employers are ready to pay the bill for them because this new breed of healthcare providers is proving that people love the convenience of their services and that they can dramatically decrease employer overall healthcare costs by improving prevention and chronic disease care.

    ### How important are the roles of advisors in building a digital health company?

    One of the biggest challenges in building a digital health company lies in finding the right product-market fit. Healthcare is incredibly complex, risk-averse, and sometimes perverse in its incentives in that healthcare pays providers for services, whether or not they help a patient’s outcomes. Having advisors that understand these complexities is incredibly valuable. They can help you to minimize missteps on your way to finding a product-market fit that makes your company successful while allowing you to maintain dedication to the patient experience and outcomes.

  :blog_lead: This second interview of our “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape”
    series, highlights the digital health innovation of Strata Health within the United
    States, and beyond. Operational in North America, the UK, France, and Australia,
    Strata Health is a privately held Canadian corporation of professionals with empathy
    for those who need care and intense respect for those who devote themselves to
    caring for others.
  :post: "_[Peter Smith](https://stratahealth.com/about-us/executive-team/), Executive
    Vice President Canada for Strata Health, shares his insights into digital health
    innovation across the globe. Working with healthcare practitioners, clinicians,
    IT specialists and administrators, [Strata Health](https://stratahealth.com/)
    pioneered the development of powerful software tools that have revolutionized
    patient flow, benefiting patients, caregivers and system efficiencies alike. Their
    proprietary intelligent referral technology has positive effects right through
    the care system from better matching of patients to specialists all the way to
    reducing paperwork._ \n\n## Q & A with Peter Smith\n\n### You operate in multiple
    countries with the U.S. being the most recent, whereas the typical digital health
    product is U.S.-centric. Do you see a big difference between the application or
    the success of digital health in the U.S. versus the rest of the world?\n\nBroadly
    speaking the application of digital health in the U.S. is more advanced than the
    rest of the world. This is due to the level of investment, the size of the population,
    and the amount of profit in the U.S. health market. There are also many other
    countries and innovation hotspots in the world but the U.S. generally attracts
    the most investment into digital health. But when you look at specific areas of
    digital health you can find examples where the U.S. lags behind the rest of the
    modern world. For example, using digital health tools and technology to improve
    the overall efficiency and cost of the health system is not that prevalent yet
    in the U.S. market. This is, at least in part, due to the fact that the U.S. market
    is for-profit private healthcare, which can create different incentives than you
    see in countries where the healthcare system is public. In countries with government
    paid (public) healthcare, those government bodies are driven to make the entire
    healthcare system as efficient as possible.\n\n### What's the biggest challenge
    holding back digital health innovation within the U.S. market?\n\nThere are many
    silos within the U.S. health market, and these silos most often operate as for-profit
    enterprises. This means each of these silos is looking to innovate when it makes
    economic sense for that silo, but not necessarily economic sense for the system,
    and not necessarily better care for the patient.\n\nThe U.S. is learning from
    the public health systems in the world. Examples are the creation of Accountable
    Care Organizations (which make providers jointly accountable for the health of
    their patients), and the concept of episode-based bundled payments (where providers
    are paid a fixed fee for a particular diagnosis or procedure, but no more if complications
    arise). The U.S. needs to review the interactions a patient makes with the various
    parts of the U.S. health system during a episodic journey, and then evaluate if
    the system is creating the right incentives for providers to perform in the best
    interest of the system and the patient, while still being a private enterprise.\n\n###
    Do you find the interest in digital health from C-suites to be the same in all
    the countries you operate in? Or different?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes there is
    equal interest in digital health from C-suites in Canada, U.S., U.K., Scotland,
    France, and Australia.\n\n### What’s Strata's greatest success story?\n\nThe health
    and social care teams across Cumbria are set to further roll out their Strata
    Health air traffic control system to manage patient transitions across the whole
    of the region. NHS Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust, University Hospitals
    of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, and Cumbria County Council have to date
    automated the process of health and social care referrals across the region, enabling
    transparent and consistent patient transitions supporting the patient journey
    while eradicating paper in the process. \n\n\n"

    We know there are many other entrepreneurs who, like us, use technology to help
    healthcare organizations better serve their patients. That is why we created an
    ongoing series called “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape,” highlighting the
    great work pursued by fellow digital health innovators.

  :post: "_Our first interview is with Seattle-based [C-SATS](https://www.csats.com),
    Inc., a venture-backed healthcare technology company on a mission to empower the
    nation’s 16 million healthcare workers and institutions to assess and improve
    their performance continuously, accurately and objectively._\n\n_Based on technology
    developed at the University of Washington by a team of surgeons, engineers and
    biostatisticians, C-SATS’ performance management system utilizes a unique combination
    of distributed experts and other reviewers available 24/7 from the Internet to
    assess healthcare professionals’ technical performance with accuracy equivalent
    to current gold standards…but at 80+% savings in cost and time to results._\n\n\n_We
    spoke with Derek Streat, C-SATS Co-founder and CEO._\n\n### When you think about
    digital health innovation for the healthcare industry and its institutions, what
    stage or part of the cycle are we in? \n\n<div class=\"person-card--vertical float-right-on-medium\">\n
    \   <img class=\"avatar circle\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2BF7cmdlRYYuOeguewIwUE/d88c8e111b8e4efedd7cee80666807a6/ZT4A0459-LinkedIn_72_dpi.jpg?f=face&fit=thumb&w=250&q=45\"
    alt=\"Derek Streat, Co-founder and CEO, C-SATS\">\n    <div class=\"person-card--caption\">\n
    \       <div class=\"person-name\">Derek Streat</div>\n        <div class=\"person-title\">Co-founder
    and CEO, C-SATS</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nWe’re still very early. Only within
    the last five years has the healthcare industry gotten around to thinking purposefully
    about patient experience. In most other industries, it’s standard operating procedure
    to surprise and delight your customers. We’re early with respect to technology
    enablement and platforms as well. The [electronic health records](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    and other systems that house the immense data generated about patients are still
    largely proprietary and closed. [Interoperability](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/#integration-understand-technology-landscape)
    is still a significant barrier to things like well-coordinated care, even within
    a single institution, because the systems are fundamentally built to stay closed
    and preserve legacy monopolies.  \n\n### Why doesn’t digital health innovation
    take hold faster in the healthcare industry?\n\nOne reason is the entrenched,
    closed-technology systems and infrastructure, making switching costs very high.
    A heightened sensitivity to privacy, security, compliance, and regulation erects
    barriers and costs as well. Health systems don’t just throw a new application
    in front of patients, and for good reason: the stakes are incredibly high. And
    if you're more risk averse, you’ll move slower. Finally, the economic models in
    healthcare are sufficiently broken that startups, often the source of scrappy
    innovation in other industries, have a harder time. That’s because those receiving
    value (patients) are disconnected from those who pay for it (think insurance).
    If it’s difficult to get paid for your product or service, and you’re a small
    startup, it’s tough to find the runway necessary to nurture true innovation.\n\n###
    Aside from the work of C-SATS, is there a digital health innovation you are most
    excited about?\n\nI’m most excited about the promise to bring [trust](http://www.csats.com/data-security/)
    to healthcare. I believe trust is the key because it leads to respect, understanding,
    and action among all stakeholders, from providers to health systems to patients.
    Trust will come through highly actionable insights derived from three areas: growing
    data sets, such as precision medicine; open systems to keep all parties informed
    of patient needs and care, for example, interoperable, cloud-based EMRs; and continuous
    monitoring and feedback loops to ensure excellent work, which is our business
    at C-SATS."
