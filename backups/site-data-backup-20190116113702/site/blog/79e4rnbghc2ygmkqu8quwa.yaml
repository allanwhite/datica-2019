:summary: There's much a digital health company needs to know about EHR integrations.
  Here are 4 essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers.
:blog_lead: 'During the past three years, we''ve done [a lot of integration work](https://datica.com/platform/success/).
  We''ve worked on more than 150 integration projects with almost 30 EHR vendors.
  We''ve done this work with big organizations and vendors to small FQHCs and niche
  EHR vendors. As a result of all this integration experience, we now have a pretty
  good grasp on the intricacies of how integration works. We can reasonably estimate
  how long it takes us to do a project and how that varies with different types of
  vendors. '
:post: "> What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of a
  computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" -- Morpheus,
  The Matrix\n\nHowever, despite our progress, there are still hundreds of systems
  that we have not integrated with. In the ambulatory setting alone, there are more
  than 650 technologies certified for Meaningful Use Stage 2. While working with the
  top 30 already gives us a leg up and covers a majority of the industry, it's not
  uncommon for us to hear about a new piece of HIT technology that our customers and
  prospects are looking to integrate with. \n\nDespite your perceptions of us as an
  integration services team, we don't have any secret super powers to solve problems
  with interoperability. Our solution, as simple as it may sound, is just being the
  best at our specialized skill set as we can be. This means:\n\n- Writing interfaces
  and transforming data to programmer-friendly formats using Mirth, an open-source
  interface engine. \n- Setting up VPNs when needed on open-source Strongswan appliances.\n-
  Having a team of experts in health data and project management on hand to analyze
  project needs. \n- Everything hosted on the HITRUST-certified Datica Platform, staffed
  by a team of ops, security, and compliance experts. \n\nWhile we may know about
  obscure technologies that power integrations at a given EHR vendor, our process
  is likely similar to anyone else's when kicking off a project. As such, it's worth
  noting that **some projects may be impossible to complete** due to external constraints.
  Turns out that data blocking in healthcare is really a thing. So, if Datica is not
  helping you in your pre-sales process with customers, it's up to you to ask all
  the necessary questions to ensure that you will be able to successfully integrate
  your application with the EHR and site in question. \n\n## Four essential questions
  digital health teams should ask their customers\n\n### 1) Can your EHR support my
  digital health product's scope?\n\n<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"
  alt=\"XKCD comic on complexity\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\">\n\nThe most common
  data integration formats we use to exchange health data are [HL7v2](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)
  and CDA-formatted documents like CCDs and CCDAs. Even though these data formats
  are standards, this doesn't mean all EHRs support exchanging data through these
  formats. In fact, some EHRs have no integration capabilities at all. Make sure the
  EHR supports the data standards that you need. Particularly, make sure the EHR supports
  the data standards in the method you need them. For example, if you need CCDs *pushed*
  to you at the end of a visit vs. *pulling* them proactively, you will want to ensure
  the EHR has the capability to manage that process. There is a very real possibility
  here that the EHR may have no suitable integration technology, which may limit your
  data integration possibilities to flat-file style extracts or may require manual
  data entry to power your application.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some integrations
  [that seem simple but are really complex](https://xkcd.com/1425/). For example,
  while it would seem obvious that any EHR could expose provider availability to schedule
  appointments, this is actually rare functionality. It's *easy* to know what appointments
  are scheduled/canceled but it's *hard* to know when you can schedule an appointment.
  Just because there are no appointments from 12:00-2:00 doesn't mean the provider
  isn't doing hospital rounds or research. As such, what may have been an easy API
  query on Allscripts, Epic, and Athena turns into a nightmare of stored procedure
  R&D and database access requirements with smaller EHRs. This is why it's good to
  have experts on hand to help you understand the rules of the road and to match integration
  expectations to reality. \n\n\n### 2) Do you have the internal or external resources
  to perform the integration work?\n\nSmaller organizations may have an EHR with HL7,
  CDA, or API integration capabilities, however, they might not have the personnel
  to configure their instance to do that integration. It's not uncommon to find a
  nurse or clinic administrator who is also the EHR administrator. While they may
  be able to manage their provider's schedules or handle some claims, setting up an
  interface or API may be foreign to them. This can be a blocker for a project. \n\nDatica
  cannot directly assist with a backend EHR build. This is usually for one of these
  reasons:\n\n- The EHR vendor would require us to sign an agreement that had some
  kind of non-compete clause to it. \n- The EHR vendor will not grant us access to
  their systems. \n- We simply lack the expertise in 650 EHRs. \n\nAs such, if the
  organization needs assistance with an internal EHR build, it's out of the scope
  of our standard integration services. While we may be able to refer the organization
  to other consultants or vendors who can assist with this EHR build, additional scope
  and cost considerations would be included.\n\n### 3) Can you commit to getting work
  done within reasonable timelines?\n\nThe top KPI for a fast, successful installation
  is an agreed upon project plan with assigned task owners and due dates. At larger
  orgs, the only task owners are typically the EHR integrators (Datica) and organizational
  IT. However, in some integrations, there may be dependencies on vendors to perform
  some pieces of setup. This is particularly true if the org is not licensed for a
  given interface yet or if the EHR vendor hosts the organization's EHR instance.
  \n\nNot to sell you a horror story but, sometimes, these timelines can be brutal.
  While many projects go live within a month of kickoff, we've also seen projects
  span a year due to EHR vendors dragging their feet on either contracting or infrastructure
  deployments. Other than badgering effectively, unless your customer's organization
  can push their EHR vendor to move faster, it's hard to make the process any faster
  than it is. If your integrated product must be live by a certain point to reach
  contractual obligations to your customer, make sure your customer has the means
  to get that system live by that point. \n\n### 4) Who will validate clinical content
  and logic facilitated through integrations?\n\nYour application may want to segment
  patients based on certain clinical attributes sent in the payload of the HL7 or
  CDA message. For example, you may want your application to send an alert when a
  patient with diabetes is admitted to the hospital. The question, of course, is how
  do you define patients with diabetes? Will they be manually defined by clinicians
  or will you be trying to define them by diagnoses from the admission, in their problem
  list, or by other clinical attributes like High A1C or being prescribed insulin?\n\nWhile
  we can apply some logic to segment patients in our interface engine, we do not have
  clinical informaticists on hand to dictate or validate logic that we would create
  at your behest. The integration engine may not be the best place to have that application
  logic and you may consider those mappings and analysis to be IP of your company.
  You may decide that an organization purchasing your digital health product can validate
  your clinical content (Epic did this) or we are happy to refer you to informatics
  consultants who are qualified to assist you.\n\n## Evaluate the Integration's TCO\n\nWith
  these additional parameters, you may want to re-evaluate the [cost to integrate](https://datica.com/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-integrations/)
  your digital health product. If you need to hire a niche EHR consultant to build
  an interface on the EHR itself and it costs $5k, can you pass that along to your
  customer or extract that value within your product? If not, you may debate the merits
  of deploying your product in a standalone fashion or adjusting the terms of your
  deal for your customer. If you're new to this, we can help. All [Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/)
  customers can engage with Datica for pre-sales support to define implementation
  strategies and to determine feasibility and ease of integration at a given site.

  :summary: 'For the first time in twenty years, hospitals, vendors, and even payers
    and life sciences providers agree on something: FHIR is the way forward.'
  :blog_lead: The hype about [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)
    has spread like, well, wildfire. The healthcare industry is often targeted by
    new, sexy technologies that sound great on the surface but often have few practical
    implementations. FHIR is NOT one of those technologies. In fact, FHIR has many
    practical use cases and benefits. More importantly, for the first time in twenty
    years, healthcare organizations, vendors, and even payers and life sciences providers
    agree this is the path forward for modern integration. This prevalent support
    is speeding FHIR’s adoption and feedback loop on improvement. Datica’s newest
    guide, [What Health Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    takes a candid look at the factors fueling open-data transformation at hospitals
    and health systems. Here are a few highlights from the guide.
  :post: "\n## EHR’s aren’t cutting it. \n\nHospitals, in particular, are looking
    for technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have
    accomplished what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order
    to improve accessibility of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally
    stored and can be viewed across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR
    implementations laid the information technology groundwork that would become the
    fabric of a healthcare transformation movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis
    Good wrote in a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
    the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
    \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
    with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
    And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
    solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do
    not, reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new
    solutions than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking
    this organizational transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The
    industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason that being able to
    access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation tools to
    innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single
    implementation of the standard [in a centralized data hub](https://datica.com/managed-integration/)
    is the most efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients
    expect transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once
    were. They expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience
    because of their experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that
    patients are consumers in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
    of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare –
    has changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
    did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a
    mortgage. Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes,
    and clear, transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is
    what people have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n##
    Government mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are
    going to be required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.
    \ We’ve seen references to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica.com/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
    [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica.com/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
    Century Cures legislation](https://datica.com/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
    The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
    in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
    providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
    and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
    for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
    on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
    and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health
    Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables
    in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\n"

  :blog_lead: |-
    Doctors need HIPAA-secure communication if they are to share [critical patient information][1] and collaborate with medical colleagues. That's what rural primary care doctor [Tracey Haas, MD][2] discovered as she practiced in an area that didn't even have a cardiologist or orthopedic surgeon. HIPAA regulations tied her hands whenever she looked at a patient EKG or X-ray and needed a real-time expert opinion from another doctor, like her husband, orthopedic surgeon [Dr. Tim Gueramy][3]. Prior to the start of [DocbookMD®][4], a secure way to communicate physician-to-physician didn't exist, so doctors, including Haas and Gueramy struggled to provide immediate and efficient care to patients.

    **When the first [iPhone®][5] came out in 2007, [_sans_][6][ camera][6], apps or app store, Haas and Gueramy began talking to other doctors to build the first use cases for DocbookMD, which went from directory app upon its launch in 2009 to communication app and finally to today's iteration -- a critical collaboration platform.**

    Healthcare has a cornocopia of information in a multitude of forms: patient records, medical images, prescriptions, patient bills, insurance claims and data research. Healthcare organizations not only must securely store data but they are mandated to process and cater to this data using a variety of data management and process solutions. If that isn't enough, healthcare providers are also required to have this data available on demand and through boundaries, whilst simultaenously focusing on the core principles of patient care delivery. DocbookMD needed a partner in order to comply with these industry necessities.

    In dealing with an early-stage company, companies often get a mixed bag with performance. However, Haas said that Datica exceeded expectations with zero problems, which has created a positive experience for everyone, especially engineering. Gueramy states that four factors played into the company's decision to go with the [Datica cohesive approach to integration][7] versus building a solution themselves:

    1. **The Datica business model** — "It's cloud-based and exactly like our business model."
    2. **Enabled DocbookMD to scale **—"That was a big one!"
    3. **Allowed the company a way to capture what future costs were going to be** \-- "That provided a way to charge our customers more appropriately and keep our costs down."
    4. **Datica being physician-based** — "That was huge."

    researcher, entrepreneur and Professor of Medicine at the University of California,
    San Francisco, shared her thoughts on technology implementation as it relates
    to patient outcomes. \"The place to start is not to have a great app or sensor,
    [nor] how to get as many people to use it for as long as possible,\" says Sim.
    Instead, she explains, \"Outcomes are generated jointly by the healthcare system
    and the patients themselves, so that's the place to start.\" This approach transcends
    wearables and applications; it can also be applied to larger technologies, such
    as electronic medical records (EMRs). \n\nIn some ways, starting with the technology
    is counterintuitive. Few organizations effectively manage patients outside of
    traditional episodes. Datica CEO and Chief Privacy Officer, [Travis Good, MD](https://datica.com/about/travis/)
    gave his perspective on the subject recently. \"The healthcare providers, focused
    most on patient outcomes, like Denver Health, have had the management of patients
    in their DNA long before applying any technology to achieve efficiencies.\" \n\n##
    Effective Technology is Outcome-Based\n\nFor healthcare innovators, starting with
    patient outcomes first promises to provide technical solutions that dramatically
    impact patients and the industry as a whole. Some development organizations are
    already taking this approach and that's exciting to watch.\n\nWorking at Datica
    gives us an in-the-trenches view of impactful industry technologies that address
    patient outcomes first. Madison-based [healthfinch][3], for example, needed EMR
    integrations for implementing its automated prescription refill solutions within
    a hospital system. Healthfinch started with the specific population need, then
    crafted a technology solution with patient outcomes at the heart of that solution.
    This story, and others from health vendors working on patient outcome-first technologies,
    can be found in the [Datica customer][4] stories. \n\nAre you developing technologies
    focused first on patient outcomes? Datica can help you scrutinize that process,
    which will ultimately provide the most value for clinicians and the hospitals
    for whom they work. That technology approach leads to long-term success and product
    viability for customers.\n\n\n[2]: /innovation/ida-sim-md/\n[3]: http://healthfinch.com\n[4]:

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
