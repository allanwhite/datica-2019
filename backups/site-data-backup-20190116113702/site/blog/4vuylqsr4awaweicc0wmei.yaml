:summary: Considering EHRs eat up clinician time, clinicians are a mobile workforce,
  and nearly 100% have smartphones, lets reimagine clinical documentation to be mobile-first.
:blog_lead: As my daughter shoved my iPhone into my face this morning to try to unlock
  it, seems fitting to be writing about mobile today. When I think of mobile, I now
  think only of smartphones and not tablets. I used to consider tablets but increasingly
  they feel closer to the desktop experience as I can’t really use them on the go
  the same way I can use my phone. A mobile strategy should be synonymous with a smartphone
  strategy.
:post: "As an aside, before I started this post I was going over my personal task
  list. I was attempting to add symbols for the various ways in which I can complete
  tasks (phone, email, etc). This goes back to my days of following [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).
  Anyway, what I quickly discovered as I sat at the airport was that none of the tasks
  I needed to complete could really be done on my smartphone. Well, I could probably
  complete several of them but it would be incredibly inefficient compared to doing
  them on my computer. It quickly occurred to me that anything I could do on mobile
  was already done, and the only tasks left were on hold until I got time on my computer.
  Most of the on-hold tasks were longer content pieces.\n\nThe title of this post
  refers to a post by [Fred Wilson from 8 years ago](https://avc.com/2010/09/mobile-first-web-second/)
  about building products first for mobile, then for larger form factors. There are
  lots of success stories of products that launched and only supported mobile (Waze
  and Instagram to name a couple). For consumer health products, the paradigm of mobile-first
  development holds true today. Look no further than then the myriad of health and
  wellness apps in the [iOS App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/). To
  gain adoption and engaged users, mobile is essential. This post isn’t about mobile
  consumer healthcare apps.\n\nOn the enterprise side of healthcare, the dominant
  software in use today is the EHR. It’s used by all different types of users across
  clinical, financial, and even operations. Specifically for clinical users, EHRs
  eat up significant amounts of time each day. By and large, the major EHR vendors
  (Epic, Cerner, and Athena) are not mobile-first. This means that clinical users
  are forced to find and spend much of their time each day on a desktop screen. For
  a very mobile workforce, this is an incredibly inefficient use of time.\n\nThere
  are examples of newer, iPad-first or iPad-only EHRs. My wife and several of her
  colleagues use a specialty-specific [iPad-only EHR from Modernizing Medicine](https://www.modmed.com).
  A scribe charts her encounters and then my wife is left, usually at the end of the
  week, with 100-150 notes to close out. She does this at home on her iPad but could
  just as easily close them out on a computer. The reason her EHR is mobile-first,
  for her at least, is because she has a scribe that charts her encounter while she
  sees the patient. The caveat to this is she still uses a laptop at home in the evenings
  to quickly close out notes and do referrals.\n\n## Unbundling the EHR\n\nConsidering
  [EHRs are inefficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060331) when it comes
  to eating up clinician time (a very valuable resource), clinicians are a mobile
  workforce, and [nearly 100% of clinicians have smartphones](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416951/smartphone-use-for-professional-purposes-among-us-physicians/),
  it’s worth thinking about how to reimagine clinical documentation to be mobile-first.
  This isn’t to say EHRs don’t help with organizational efficiency but I’m thinking
  about clinician efficiency. The major EHR vendors listed above are not going to
  be replaced anytime soon and, if I was an investor, I wouldn’t invest in a new enterprise
  EHR. That leaves the option of chipping away at specific sets of functionality currently
  in the EHR. I have come to refer to this as [unbundling the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\nEHRs
  in a mobile-first world are only possible by unpacking the functionality of the
  EHR into discrete workflows/functions that can be completed efficiently on a smartphone.
  This isn’t replacing the EHR but is a way to make using an EHR more efficient. It’s
  mobile-enabling the EHR, or more accurately clinical workflow, in a stepwise fashion
  with a goal to leverage mobile to minimize desktop time and use. The data remains
  within the EHR (at least for the immediate term) but the ways in which clinicians
  interface with EHR data are broken up into discrete, mobile-enabled functions. Proving
  ROI with this approach is not hard if solutions either improve throughput/capacity
  for clinicians or show benefits like closing out notes in a more timely way and
  being able to bill faster or more accurately. And marketing these solutions as helping
  healthcare organizations better leverage the massive investment they have made in
  EHRs will resonate. Essentially, the goal is to leverage mobile to more efficiently
  use an EHR and only leave certain functions to non-mobile devices.\n\nIn order to
  succeed the specific functionality enabled on mobile needs to be able to pull the
  relevant context, usually based on the patient. By definition, these types of solutions
  are dependent on EHR data and must be able to integrate with the EHR. This is becoming
  easier as EHRs [open up data via FHIR](https://datica.com/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
  but data integration remains the biggest hurdle to unpacking the EHR and starting
  to break up the EHR user experience. This is another example of EHR customers needing
  to push their EHR vendors harder to accelerate initiatives to ease access to EHR
  data.\n\n## Mobile-first EHR Tools \n\nThere are already successful examples of
  unbundling the EHR to leverage mobile. Many of these, even ones that have scaled
  to hundreds of hospitals, are still only scratching the surface of unbundling the
  EHR.\n\n- __Clinical Communications__. Communication is a major part of delivering
  care to patients. It also happens to be something that EHRs don’t do very well.
  Companies like [Voalte](https://www.voalte.com/) and [TigerConnect](https://www.tigerconnect.com/)
  have built products to connect clinicians. And now these companies are expanding
  the value to users with new workflows and data integration. I’ve never seen this
  statistic but I wonder how much time nurses and doctors spend in clinical communication
  apps vs EHRs.\n\n- __Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI)__. This is a new mobile-enabled
  functionality to be unbundled from the EHR. [Artifact Health](https://www.artifacthealth.com/)
  is a good example. Artifact built a mobile application that brings relevant patient
  context related to CDI into a mobile interface where clinicians can answer simple
  questions. The answers to those questions are then returned back to the EHR and/or
  billing. Instead of having a stack of CDI requests linger in an inbox in the EHR
  or a physical desk, clinicians can now complete CDI requests quickly and easily
  on the go.\n\n- __Real-time Device Data__. This is an area where [Airstrip](https://www.airstrip.com/)
  still dominates. Airstrip started with maternal heart rate monitors and have since
  extended to other medical devices as well as EHR data. The goal for Airstrip is
  to be the mobile interface for clinical workflow and mobile-relevant clinical data.
  They offer desktop tools but the real success of Airstrip is in focusing on the
  mobile experience of clinicians. \n\n- __Data Entry__. Data entry into EHRs is a
  massive time suck for clinicians. There are a few different approaches to unbundle
  this functionality from the EHR. The most widely used today is scribing, with companies
  like [Augmedix](https://www.augmedix.com/) and [iScribes](https://iscribes.co/)
  as examples of technology-enabled virtual scribing. Scribing is essentially a Mechanical
  Turk operation with audio, and sometimes video, recordings of patient encounters
  documented in the EHR by people other than the providers conducting the encounters.
  Newer voice-based tools intelligently automate the creation of cards of documentation
  based on physician speech recording during encounters.\n\n- __Virtual Visits__.
  Despite what the EHR vendors may say, telemedicine is not exactly a core EHR function.
  Increasingly, virtual care is being delivered by clinical staff via mobile apps
  and services like [Spruce Health](https://sprucehealth.com) and [Zipnosis](https://zipnosis.com).\n\nThese
  are just a few examples. There are lots more opportunities to unbundle specific
  functionality of the EHR. While not replacing the EHR or even obviously threatening
  its dominant place in clinical and health IT, the approach of unbundling the EHR
  chips away at one of the two primary pillars of the EHR moat — the EHR as the primary
  clinical user interface and the EHR as the primary clinical data repository.\n\nBy
  leveraging mobile, new mobile-first EHR tools have the potential to engage very
  valuable users — clinicians. Once engaged, there are opportunities to extend functionality
  with interconnected apps and data (iOS shortcuts would be very interesting ways
  to link clinical apps into workflows). And, the hardest part of the process, [integration
  with EHR data](https://datica.com/compliant-managed-integration/), is only done
  once at each site so an extension to new offerings is considerably easier after
  the first one.\n\nUnbundling the EHR is where we are going to see the most successful
  disruption of the EHR in enterprise health IT. It’s a matter of timing and the market
  is now ripe as we shift towards a post-EHR world.\n\n"

  :summary: 'The January, 2018 draft of the Trusted Exchange Framework is the first
    real step toward interoperability since the Cures Act was passed. '
  :blog_lead: 'One of the biggest obstacles to using electronic health data to the
    fullest potential is the lack of interoperability. At every level of healthcare,
    the lack of interoperability causes problems: patients cannot easily access their
    own health data, providers have problems accessing the health information of new
    patients, researchers cannot access the data necessary to identify trends that
    would improve population health, and technology companies struggle to compete
    in a closed marketplace. '
  :post: "The [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text),
    sometimes referred to as the Cures Act, which was passed in December 2016, identifies
    the need for interoperability. Interoperability would make the exchange of personal
    health information (PHI) possible while still maintaining security. Currently,
    information is siloed within EHR systems, and [data integration with those EHRs](https://datica.com/platform/integration/)
    is frequently cited issue for healthcare providers. \n\nAlongside the need for
    various stakeholders to be able to access information, there is the requirement
    to follow the dictates of the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA)](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/). Information needs
    to be accessible, but must also remain secure. Through the Cures Act, Congress
    instructed the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to create or support the
    creation of a framework for health information networks (HINs) to exchange health
    information through a common agreement. \n\n## What is The Trusted Exchange Framework?\n\nThe
    draft Trusted Exchange Framework is the first step toward interoperability. The
    ONC has published a [User’s Guide to Understanding the Draft Trusted Exchange
    Framework](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-guide.pdf). The
    document was released on January 5, 2018, and consists of two parts:\n\nPart A
    - Principles for Trusted Exchange\nPart B - Minimum Required Terms and Conditions
    for Trusted Exchange\n\nStakeholders are [encouraged to submit comments](https://beta.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement)
    through February 20, 2018. Once comments have been submitted and a final version
    agreed upon, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) will
    be published in the Federal Register. The ONC expects the final version to be
    published by late 2018. \n\nThe stakeholders include: \n\n* Health information
    networks\n* Federal agencies\n* Public health organizations\n* Individuals\n*
    Payers\n* Providers\n* Technology developers\n\nOne of the most important goals
    of the Trusted Exchange Framework is to create what the ONC describes as “a single
    on-ramp” to interoperability. Currently, healthcare organizations use different
    point-to-point interfaces to exchange PHI with each other. This system requires
    the creation and maintenance of all those individual interfaces, which is expensive
    and inefficient. \n\nCreating one framework for various stakeholders to exchange
    information will simplify the process, make accessing their own PHI easier for
    patients, and create a more competitive market for technology companies. \n\n##
    Two Parts of the Trusted Exchange Framework\n\n### Trusted Exchange Framework
    Part A\n\nThe first part of the Framework is Principles for Trusted Exchange.
    The ONC has defined six principles: \n1. Standardization\n2. Transparency\n3.
    Cooperation and Non-Discrimination\n4. Security and Patient Safety\n5. Access\n6.
    Data-Driven Accountability \n\nThese general principles are described as “guardrails,”
    and the goal of Part A is to build trust among the various HINs. \n\n### Trusted
    Exchange Framework Part B\n\nThe second part of the framework is Minimum Required
    Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. This section creates common practices
    for the exchange of health information, including a common authentication process,
    rules for exchange, and organizational and operational practices. \n\nSpeaking
    to [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/onc-genevieve-morris-trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-interoperability),
    Genevieve Morris, the principal deputy national coordinator for health information
    technology at the ONC said, \n\n> This is just the floor of what those required
    terms and conditions are. We all just have to agree to the same terms in order
    for that exchange to happen.” \n\n## Building on the 3 Goals of Interoperability\n\nThe
    Trusted Exchange Framework builds on the work that the industry has already done
    to advance interoperability. [A press release](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/01/05/draft-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-released-hhs.html)
    from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the draft stresses
    that there are three important goals of interoperability: \n\n1. Patient access
    - patients should be able to easily access their own health information.\n2. Population-level
    data exchange - both providers and payers need access to population-level health
    data in order to analyze trends, outcomes, and costs.\n3. Open and accessible
    APIs - giving the health IT community access to health information will improve
    the entrepreneurial climate, leading to innovation and improved usability. \n\nThe
    ONC will outsource the actual implementation of the framework. The ONC will hold
    an “open and competitive selection of a single Recognized Exchange Framework Entity
    (RCE) from the industry,” wrote Morris in a [blog post on HealthIT Buzz](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-common-sense-approach-achieving-health-information-interoperability/).
    \ \n\nThe RCE will work with the ONC to develop the final version of the TEFCA
    that is published in the Federal Register. \n"

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

  :summary: 'In this 3rd part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series, Travis Good MD,
    CEO of Datica, offers a deep look at what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. '
  :blog_lead: "Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH
    and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health
    record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who
    support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have
    delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the
    outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are
    here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and,
    by extension, patients.\n\nIn this third part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. "
  :post: "\nToday, EHRs are in use by [95+% of eligible providers](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Hospital-Progress-to-Meaningful-Use-by-size-practice-setting-area-type.php).
    With that massive adoption, EHRs, at least the meaningful use certified EHRs deemed
    by the government worthy of carrot and stick adoption incentives, play two foundational
    roles in healthcare today.\n\n1. **EHRs are the hub of patient data.** They collect
    and store both subjective information and objective data from devices. They store
    reports and other kinds of file attachments. They store discrete data.\n2. **EHRs
    are the hub of clinical workflow.** Though EHRs are designed for general workflows,
    they don’t provide the tailored fit clinicians actually need forcing them to have
    to adapt their workflows to EHRs and not the other way around as it should be.
    Orders, messages, referrals, you name it. If providers are not entering or looking
    for data in the EHR, they are using the EHR to accomplish a task.\n\nThese two
    roles are foundational to building solutions, technology, or technology-enabled
    processes on top of the EHR; there are exceptions to this rule but, increasingly,
    even these exceptions are being forced to integrate. This changes everything,
    especially for those innovators in healthcare that are trying to develop solutions
    for providers and patients. But, almost as importantly, it forces EHRs to now
    either a) build new solutions themselves, b) support new 3rd party solutions,
    or c) risk replacement by newer EHRs that do either a or b. This process isn’t
    happening overnight, but it is happening.\n\nHealthcare technology tends to cycle
    every 15 years or so between best-of-breed solutions and all-in-one platforms.
    Today’s EHRs are at the tail end of a 15-year cycle that has seen their adoption
    grow massively as healthcare providers have implemented one of a few EHR options
    as platforms. Now, we are starting to cycle back to best-of-breed solutions as
    it has become abundantly clear that monolithic EHRs cannot develop solutions fast
    enough to meet the demands of the market. One platform cannot do everything. And
    EHRs, at least the major ones, are trying a mix of the a and b strategy above
    to hold their place as the central healthcare IT software.\n\n## EHRs still control
    access to patient data\n\nEHRs still control access to data and clinician workflows
    and have used that control to slow down adoption of new digital health solutions.
    EHRs have developed proprietary programs, or app stores/orchards/ programs, in
    attempts to support, whether that support is real or perceived, 3rd party solutions
    — Epic has App Orchard, Cerner has Cerner Cares, Allscripts has the Allscripts
    Developer Program, and Athena has More Disruption Please (there are more examples,
    but these are the big four). While programs from Athena and Allscripts are mature
    at this point, the emerging programs from Epic and Cerner have been slow to take
    off at best or failing at achieving any meaningful adoption at worst. The reasons
    for their slow take off or failure are partially technology-related (the app stores
    are proprietary) and partially business-model related (Apple can take 30% of app
    store partner revenue because Apple is the primary driver of revenue whereas EHRs
    are trying to collect 30% of revenue as a tax merely to integrate with them.)
    The $15-20K EHR integration price tag we grew to loathe is now a 30% tax on partner
    revenue.\n\nAt the same time EHRs try to support 3rd party applications, they
    are trying to build their own solutions to shut out digital health products. Every
    EHR now has a data warehousing solution, most have a population health tool, and
    many have telemedicine offerings. Similarly to Microsoft’s strategy of using its
    Windows and Office customer base to sell Azure cloud services, EHRs are trying
    to sell their own new products. The problem is none of the major EHRs are as savvy,
    either technically or business-wise, as Microsoft.\n\n## The Slow Burn of FHIR\n\nConcurrently,
    many major EHRs are supporting FHIR as a standard way to access EHR data. Some
    of that support may be vaporware, but most EHRs are at least announcing [FHIR
    capabilities](https://datica.com/guide/fhir/). FHIR has been in discussions for
    several years and, despite a lot of broad-based support, is moving painfully slowly
    towards adoption and actual implementation. Yes, the big four may support reading
    data from their EHRs via FHIR, but there is very little a real application can
    do by only reading data from the EHR. At times, the slow pace of FHIR adoption
    seems intentional by the many incumbents supporting it. Despite that, a recent
    survey found that health system CIOs consider FHIR to be the technology with the
    [most promise in 2018](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/interoperability/cios-see-fhir-potential-game-changer-and-blockchain-overhyped-survey),
    meaning FHIR is here to stay.\n\n## Is Replacing EHRs the Path Forward?\n\nIf
    EHRs are failing to support 3rd-party solutions and failing to develop and sell
    their own digital health products fast enough, does that leave option C — replacing
    EHRs — as the only path forward? \n\nNot exactly. \n\nAs both the hub of data
    and hub of clinical workflow, EHRs are extremely entrenched today. The vast majority
    of health system IT department resources are dedicated to supporting EHRs, so
    there are strange incentive conflicts. And, FHIR has been highly effective at
    buying EHRs more time.\n\nAs I said before, this process is not happening overnight,
    but it is happening. More industry leaders are [speaking out against EHRs](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180122/NEWS/180129979)
    and the rampant blocking of innovation so needed in healthcare. EHRs can only
    buy so much time. What I think we are going to see over the next 3-5 years, a
    time that also coincides with when a lot of health systems will have written down
    the heavy upfront capital expense of EHRs, is EHRs becoming less and less a clinical
    workflow tool and more and more a clinical encounter documentation tool and one
    source, not the primary hub, of clinical data.\n\nThere are two parts to that
    prediction. The first just means that we’re going to see purpose-built tools for
    specific workflows. We already see that today with clinical communication tools
    like [Voalte](http://www.voalte.com/) that are making the lives of nurses easier
    by enabling them to use a fast, mobile, purpose-built platform for their workflows
    and communications. The second is piggybacking on the inevitable march toward
    continuous and complete patient data. EHR data today is episodic. Clinical data
    tomorrow will include episodic EHR data but also remote monitoring data, social
    data, genetic data, and always-on sensor data. The EHR data will be one part of
    a much larger puzzle. I think the EHRs of today, the large ones I mention in this
    post, have too much technical debt to move fast enough to serve as the hub of
    clinical data tomorrow. They are saddled with their history.\n\n## 6 Predictions
    about EHRs in 2018\n\nPredictions are easy when you don’t have specific timelines.
    So what do I think we’ll see with EHRs and clinical data in 2018?\n\n1. **More
    direct patient access to EHR data.** There was already a major announcement of
    [Apple enabling its customers to access Epic and Cerner data](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/apple-health-app-effort-to-engage-consumers-by-sharing-ehr-info).\n2.
    **More available production FHIR services.** Most of these will be couched as
    pilots or beta, but progress is progress. FHIR will also be used for direct patient
    access to data.\n3. **Social determinants of health matter…a lot.** Everybody
    always cites studies that show WHO data of high US healthcare spending with resultant
    lousy health outcomes. This is true. And sad. But it’s not the whole story. In
    the US, we spend far less on social programs and services than most countries
    that beat our health outcomes. The result is a health system that doubles as a
    social safety net, with all costs incurred by the health system. Social data and
    care based on that data will be a major shift in 2018, and I think most of that
    will happen outside the EHR, at least regarding data sources and storage.\n4.
    **Demand for data access by EHR customers.** One of the challenges when integrating
    with an EHR is that the default answer is usually “no”. There is invariably friction
    to overcome and it is up to the health system to overcome this friction. I think
    2018 we will see a lot less acceptance of “no” and more pushing for EHRs to open
    up access to data, whether that data is exposed via FHIR or HL7 v2.x or a proprietary
    API middle layer like that provided by Sansoro Health.\n5. **Mega-mergers require
    new strategies around data sharing from unwilling players.** Large-scale mergers
    like Dignity/CHI and Providence-St. Joseph’s/Ascension will show vendors willing
    to demonstrate a more willing ability to play nice so that they don’t lose market
    share as hundreds of hospital sites are brought under one IT umbrella for the
    sake of efficiency. Epic has already shown some cards around this with their [Come
    Together/Happy Together/Working Together](https://www.epic.com/epic/post/3222)
    trio, but it’s hard to say if it’ll stave off mega losses in the usual hospital
    merger shakeup where two EHR vendors enter and only [one leaves](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/advocate-health-care-aurora-healthcare-epic-ehr-merger-care-coordination).\n6.
    **More ambulatory EHR providers bite the dust.** Now that the dust of Meaningful
    Use has settled, more companies are beginning to evaluate if they want to stay
    at the EHR table. With Allscripts acquiring both McKesson’s EHR suite and Practice
    Fusion (at a loss), anticipating more contraction in the EHR space as disinterested
    players try to divest assets while they are still holding water (GE Centricity,
    Greenway) seems like a safe bet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might want

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
