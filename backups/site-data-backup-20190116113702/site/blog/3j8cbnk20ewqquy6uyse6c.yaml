:summary: Compared to others, healthcare information systems (HCIS) are industry specific.
  The distinctiveness to their development is attributed to six elements.
:blog_lead: In 2015, the Healthcare Information Systems (HCIS) market accounted for
  $40.39 billion and is forecasted to reach $70+ billion by 2022. Rising government
  initiatives, increasing healthcare costs and aging population are some of the factors
  driving the market growth. Compared to information systems in other industries,
  HCISs are specific to healthcare. The distinctiveness characterizing the development
  of HCISs in healthcare is attributed to six elements.
:post: "### Mismatched Information\n\nAt all stages related to care, information systems
  showcase errors since healthcare quality is vigilantly implemented and diligently
  pursued to minimize the impact associated with information mismatch.\n\n### Nature
  of Personal Information\n\nHealth information systems mostly manage information
  of personal nature. Most of the data transfer between different healthcare entities
  involves real and possible risk of information landing in the wrong hands. This
  perception of compromised privacy makes information exchange in health become extremely
  convoluted.\n\n### Regulators and Competition Influence\n\nAll patient data in healthcare
  is subject to regulatory policies. Providers of information and communications technology
  (ICT) based solutions experience additional complexities when organizations exploit
  the advantages of their offering. This makes it more complex to realize ICT-driven
  innovations within healthcare.\n\n### Professionalism and Hierarchy\n\nPowerful
  stakeholders such as the hierarchical nature and professionals driving the health
  care organizations often resist technology, creating barriers to fully exploit the
  potentials associated with health information systems.\n\n### Multidisciplinary\n\nAlthough
  ICT faces multiple barriers in healthcare, there is an overall unity in the usage
  of HCISs. This is because of most of the healthcare services are interdisciplinary
  in nature. This heterogeneity of disciplines in healthcare makes using ICT very
  complex – forcing an approach that makes the information system different from the
  simple classification system usually followed in other industries.\n\n### Implementation,
  Learning and Adaptation\n\nWithin the delivery of healthcare, there is an ongoing
  tension between the need for order on one hand and the need for sensitivity on the
  other. Because of this tension, the importance of effective learning and adaptation
  surrounding the implementation of HCISs increases. The acuteness of the situation
  can be estimated from the fact that solutions working well in one specific context
  in healthcare does not necessarily work in others.\n\nInformation systems in healthcare
  are processes that involve all key stakeholders in an organization's goals, including
  the project, business unit and the company's overall management. This mandates transparent
  decision-making in the governance process of the enterprise architecture ensuring
  that organizational changes move in the desired direction, while also implementing
  objectives and goals. Such ownership processes may include enforced or clearly spelled
  rules or may be broadly defined IT principles. Apart from allowing an organization
  to achieve IT objectives, Information systems help in creating and enforcing accountability.
  Given the complexity and specificity of the healthcare information systems market,
  we can only expect funding and interest to increase in the coming years.\n\nQuestions?
  Reach out to us [directly][1], [tweet us][2], or provide us your contact information
  to the right. We'll solve your problem so you can focus on your solution.\n\n[1]:
  mailto:hello@datica.com\n[2]: https://twitter.com/daticahealth\n\nThe most basic
  part of any HealthKit data point is a unit, which are essentially units of measure
  for the health data collected via HealthKit. You can collect numbers from your users
  to no end but they will have little meaning without a unit. In HealthKit, the class
  representing units is called `HKUnit`. Units are fairly straightforward and many
  units are already builtin to HealthKit and have helper methods to quickly create
  the unit you need. Or if there is no helper method to create your unit, the easiest
  way is to create the unit with what is called a unit string\n\n\tHKUnit *gram =
  [HKUnit gramUnit];\n\tHKUnit *mgPerdL = [HKUnit unitFromString:@\"mg/dL\"];\n\nYour
  units should be chosen appropriately for the type of data being collected. For example,
  you wouldn't choose grams when measuring temperature and its unlikely you would
  choose Kelvin when measuring temperature either. The two most appropriate choices
  for temperature would be either Fahrenheit or Celsius. This choice is up to personal
  preference as HealthKit does not prefer one or the other. There are a number of
  APIs within HealthKit that aid in converting units between US standard units and
  the metric system but those are beyond the scope of this blog post.\n"

  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn how governance impacts standards and collaboration in healthcare
    2. Understand the complexity of integrations and the role of APIs
    3. Develop greater awareness for crowdsourcing related to FHIR and healthcare technology advancements
    4. Discover the realities of who should own healthcare data
  :post: |-
    **On the road building of healthcare infrastructure:** "It's very similar economics is to road building. It's the creation of infrastructure that enables exchange to happen. Everybody's interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B. But not everybody's interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to get from A to B."

    **On how APIs impact the end user:** "[Clinicians] are trapped in systems that they don't feel bring value to them or their patients."

    "People have **widely variable workflows.** There is no single description of the workflow that worked for everybody."

    "With APIs it's pretty hard to explain to most end users why APIs makes a difference. But if you **focus on the outcome,** which is better integration, better system wide flows of data and more mobility to customize their experience, then that story becomes compelling for a user."

    **On how FHIR and crowdsourcing address mappings:** "FHIR actually includes specific primary artifacts for dealing with crosswalks and mappings, and we're investing as a community, in building the tools around them. But for the first time, part of the main specification of what we do is the ability to publish, share, review those crosswalks and mappings and to make the executable part of the overall frameworks."

    "We would like to set up a community that manages shared, public crosswalks between common coding systems. We have the infrastructure and the community is starting to think about doing that."

    "I'm a very strong believer in crowdsourcing when it comes to something like crosswalks and mappings. And the ability to use the crowd to refine the fine detail."

    **On the growth of free EHR solutions:** "There's certainly going to be a growth of free EHR solutions. Of course, free is a misnomer, somebody's going to pay someone for the implementation, perhaps with consulting fees."

    **On data ownership:** "There are people who argue that the patient should really own the data, but it's not really the patient's data. It's not easy to tell [patient vs provider data] apart and that will continue to be a challenge for us. From a market perspective, the patient can only own the data if the patient pays to own the data. I do not see anyone considering that fact realistically."

    **On security and privacy of patient data:** "[A black market for healthcare] exists because having healthcare data increases your ability to get access to financial accounts."

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
