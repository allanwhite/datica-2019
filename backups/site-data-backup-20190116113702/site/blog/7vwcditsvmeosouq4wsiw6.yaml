:summary: Most people probably do not realize that traditional data management and
  patient index tools only automatically match approximately 70 percent of records.
:blog_lead: 'If you haven’t been following along on our blog, we have been taking
  a dive into the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) recently released report,
  [Nonfederal Effort to Help Achieve Health Information Interoperability](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672585.pdf).
  Specifically, we have been exploring the five barriers this report found to achieving
  true nation-wide interoperability:

'
:post: "1. Insufficiencies in health data standards\r\n2. Variation in state privacy
  rules\r\n3. Accurately matching patients’ health records\r\n4. Costs associated
  with interoperability\r\n5. The need for governance and trust among entities\r\n\r\nFor
  the fourth entry, we would like to explore the difficulties in accurately matching
  patients’ health records. What most people probably do not realize is that traditional
  data management and patient index tools only automatically match approximately 70
  percent of records. The other 30 percent will fall into a queue of “potential matches”
  – records that are similar but not exact so they cannot be considered non-matches.\r\n\r\nAs
  is well known, the exchange of health data across care settings is a central and
  necessary constituent of a patient-centric model of care that can improve quality
  and reduce costs. So in order to do this, enablement of a clinician to view an encompassing
  picture of the patient is required for efficiency and accurate matching of patient
  health records across these care settings. On the flip side, incorrectly matching
  a patient to a health record may have privacy and security implications, such as
  wrongful disclosure, in addition to treatment based on another patient’s health
  information.\r\n\r\n### Data standardization must be the solution!\r\n\r\nYes, possibly.
  And no, probably.\r\n\r\nThe lack of standardization in the data attributes or fields
  used for matching, increases error rates, as well as significant burdens and costs
  within the health care systems. Standardization is one potential solution, as many
  of the interoperability initiative representatives reported that when trying to
  become interoperable with other entities, the process gets held up due to incongruence
  in data sets and matching variables.\r\n\r\n### So what’s the alternative?\r\n\r\nA
  few alternative solutions exist on the market. One of the more well-known comes
  from a company called [Verato](http://www.verato.com/). This solution surpasses
  traditional matching solutions. The company has created an innovative matching engine
  that can match up to 98% of patient records by associating each patient record to
  an identity in its proprietary reference database, trademarked as CARBON.\r\n\r\nKnow
  of any other solutions on the market that can accurately match patient records?
  We’d love to hear about them! [Tweet](https://twitter.com/catalyzeio) or [email](https://catalyze.io/blog/hello@catalyze.io)
