:summary: 'A roundup of this week''s news in healthcare: CVS, Hospital Hacks, VA,
  Obamacare, Interoperability'

:post: "### [CVS Stops Tobacco Sales Today, Changes Name To Reflect New Era](http://getprismatic.com/story/1409719091444)\nCVS,
  the giant drugstore chain that shocked the U.S. public health community and Wall
  Street with its decision earlier this year to remove tobacco products from its shelves
  by October, said cigarettes are officially no longer on store shelves a month ahead
  of schedule.\n\nThe move to remove tobacco products effective this morning coincides
  with a company decision to also change its corporate name to CVS Health (CVS), from
  CVS/Caremark Corp. to reflect “its broader health care commitment” and desire to
  change the future health of Americans. \n\n### [Hospital Hacks Are Skyrocketing
  Because Hospitals Are Super Easy to Hack](http://getprismatic.com/story/1409759321025)\nThe
  security research firm Websense says that cyberattacks on hospitals have increased
  600 percent in the last 10 months. Undoubtedly, much of that increase can be accounted
  for by the previously reported attack on Community Health Systems, which affected
  some 4.5 million patients in 206 hospitals across 29 states. Websense and other
  security research firms say that the now infamous Heartbleed vulnerability is to
  blame for many of the breaches, though patches have since been put into place. Those
  firms also say that hundreds of thousands of patients remain vulnerable. \n\n###
  [VA to reimburse for certain clinical activity trackers](http://mobihealthnews.com/36158/va-to-reimburse-for-certain-clinical-activity-trackers/)\nAt
  the beginning of this month, MobiHealthNews noted in an In-Depth report that a new
  class of wireless, wearable activity tracker is increasingly finding its way into
  the clinical space, especially to help people with movement disorders or lower body
  injuries. That trend just got a big boost from the US Department of Veteran Affairs,
  which thanks to a recent change in its contracting template will soon begin reimbursing
  its doctors for activity trackers in some circumstances. \n\n### [Some big Obamacare
  news: premiums will fall in seven big cities](http://getprismatic.com/story/1409912718517)\nIn
  major cities across the country, Obamacare premiums are falling.\n\nThat is not
  normal; health-insurance premiums nearly always go up and up and up. They rarely,
  if ever, decrease.\n\nBut analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation have scoured
  insurers rate filings and find that premiums for Obamacare's benchmark plan will
  decrease, on average, by 0.8 percent across 16 large cities. That could be early
  evidence that a key premise of Obamacare is working: insurers are competing on the
  marketplaces, and that could be driving health insurance prices down. \n\n### [Health
  IT Interoperability Requires Industry Collaboration](http://getprismatic.com/story/1410290371217)\nFor
  data and systems interoperability to become widespread, both government and private
  stakeholders must clear roadblocks.\nAs we approach National Health IT Week, it
  is a good time to take into consideration how we, as active members within our own
  healthcare organizations, can help forge a path that results in true healthcare
  interoperability.\n\nThe healthcare industry is at a critical point -- although
  interoperability is poised to radically transform the healthcare system, achieving
  it poses unique challenges and barriers to success that are problematic around the
  world. Will true healthcare interoperability ever happen? I think it will. But first,
  key industry players must collaborate -- not simply rely on our national agenda
  -- to achieve it. \n"
