:summary: The False Claims Act inflicts forfeitures on anyone and everyone who knowingly
  forges, alters, falsifies, or demolishes documents to protected payment.
:blog_lead: "First, what is the False Claims Act? \n\nThe False Claims Act inflicts
  forfeitures on anyone and everyone who knowingly forges, alters, falsifies, or demolishes
  documents to protected payment. \n"
:post: "The repercussions for each civil penalty if found in violation are:\n\n- Each
  claim of no fewer than $5,500 and no more than $11,000\n- Triple the amount of treble
  damages that the federal government sustains.\n\n### Meaningful Use\n\nSecond, what
  is Meaningful Use?\n\nThis is the terminology that the federal government uses as
  a way of describing the utilization and compliance of Electronic Health Record technology
  in a fashion to accomplish specific requirements:\n\n- Enhance quality, safety,
  and efficiency, while minimizing health disparities\n- Encourage patient and family
  engagement \n- Improve coordination of care and public/population health\n- Sustain
  security and privacy of PHI\n\n### What do False Claims Act and Meaningful Use have
  to do with HIPAA compliance?\n\nAmong the requirements mandated by Meaningful Use
  to receive incentive payments is to conduct a data security risk assessment. On
  a similar note, one of HIPAA’s core requirements is for entities to conduct the
  same assessment. In layman’ terms, compliance with one should satisfy the requirements
  by the other. Should be simple, right?\n\nFalse!\n\nPre-audit screenings have begun
  for the next round of audits to be conducted randomly. If an audit determines that
  there is a possibility that an entity has not performed a risk assessment, the findings
  could be shared with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This would
  trigger repayment of Meaningful Use and False Claims Act repercussions and possible
  jail time. And to add fuel to the fire, an investigation would be opened and conducted
  that could result in further fines and settlements.\n\n### So what do you do?\n\nThis
  part is simple. Conduct a risk assessment. Not performing one has the potential
  of costing millions, prison time, reputation loss, and exclusion from Medicaid and
  Medicare.\n\nLearn all you need to learn about HIPAA from our [free compliance guide](/guide/hipaa/)
  to become a compliance expert in a single coffee break.\n\n"
