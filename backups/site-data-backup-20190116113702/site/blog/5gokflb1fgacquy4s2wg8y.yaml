:post: "$125 billion is wasted every year on nearly one billion doctors’ visits that
  Americans take that could simply be solved with a bit of education. The efforts
  to solve this problem is rapidly becoming the fastest growing market in healthcare.
  It’s a race that's promoted by the massive shift in the healthcare industry’s economics,
  mandated by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Because of this shift,
  an immense opportunity rests in the hands of healthcare entrepreneurs. Among these
  aspiring go-getters slashing away at healthcare’s frivolous spending are [Health123](http://www.health123.com/)
  and SocialWellth. \n\n### SocialWellth\n\nLed by Founder & CEO, [David Vinson](http://socialwellth.com/company/leadership-team/),
  Las Vegas-based SocialWellth is a new health and wellness startup seeking to deliver
  value-based care by creating an insightful connection between healthcare consumers
  and sponsors. The acquisition of Happtique almost a year ago created a leading-edge
  connection to the provider community and the results have been plentiful. Just a
  few months ago, SocialWellth raised $7.5M to expand their mHealth app store offerings
  to healthcare providers and also to expand research and development endeavors. Not
  solely focused on provider relationships, SocialWellth is dialed in to the continuum
  of care, taking creative, and scientific-based approaches to deliver new experiences
  for all those involved in consumer care. With so many digital tools, services and
  applications (100,000+), SocialWellth is still able to ensure a HIPAA compliant
  environment to protect all patient data. Datica is proud to share SocialWellth’s
  vision into transforming the healthcare experience and progressing towards a value-based
  care model. \n\n### Health123\n\n[Rebecca Norlander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccanorlander)
  and [Rachel Lanham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanhamrachel), co-founders of [Health123](http://www.health123.com/),
  are leading a mission towards value-based care by empowering technologies and all
  those involved in patient care. Another facet of moving towards a value-based care
  model is recognizing preventive care, and that’s what [Health123](http://www.health123.com/)
  aims to achieve. Through a flexible, customizable cloud platform, Health123 fills
  the gaps between doctor visits by delivering care components and plans to patients
  that give the precise information at the exact time needed. By doing so, [Health123](http://www.health123.com/)
  promotes patient education and engagement through a platform that entices patients
  and physicians alike. All of us at Catalyze advocate and applaud Health123’s mission
  towards bettering our healthcare industry.\n\n> Good quality is less costly because
  of more accurate diagnoses, fewer treatment errors, lower complication rates, faster
  recovery, less invasive treatment, and the minimization of the need for treatment.
  More broadly, better health is less expensive than illness. - Michael E. Porter,
