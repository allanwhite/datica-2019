:blog_lead: 'Almost three years ago, I wrote a blog post about why [there was no up
  front pricing](https://datica.com/blog/why-there-is-no-up-front-pricing/) for the
  Datica Platform or our integration services. It was as earnest as I could get about
  how I felt about our sales model at the time: there was no shortage of people who
  came to our website not understanding why handling some aspects of HIPAA compliance
  or data integration wasn''t as cheap as a $5 Digital Ocean droplet.'
:post: "![Old office](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2eMSsIeNu8YcUuOW6qkEYS/6980a750bcb5cf100747466b6cb69a7e/Datica_old_office.001.png?fm=jpg)\n*That's
  me in 2015, in the background of a photo in Datica's original office.* \n \n*Editor's
  note: As we roll out updates and changes to our new Kubernetes-based compliance
  platform our pricing is fluxuating and we're temporarily back to providing custom
  quotes based on specific configurations. Learn more about our [public product roadmap](https://datica.com/blog/what-were-building-daticas-public-product-roadmap/)
  and the exciting things happening at Datica* \n\nWe've done a lot of work since
  then, and we've now changed our opinion on the topic. We now offer up front Datica
  pricing right on the website: [https://datica.com/pricing/](https://datica.com/pricing/).
  I'd like to go through my old article and discussed what changed and why we now
  offer upfront pricing.\n\n1) \"First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead
  to buyer confusion.\" & 2) \"Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges
  comparisons with companies who weren’t direct competitors.\"\n \nRealistically,
  our largest competitors in the compliant cloud space aren’t other PaaS vendors but
  rather DIY solutions on one of the major IaaS vendors like Amazon or Azure. At the
  time, it was hard to communicate exactly what the total cost of ownership for build
  vs. buy would be, since we didn’t fully understand our costs as we were building
  infra at scale and going through our initial sets of audits. We've since written
  massive amounts of documentation on the subject: our [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
  and [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) guides provide in depth details
  on effort and costs while our [open-sourced policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies)
  provide a detailed roadmap of what it takes to prove HITRUST certification if you
  were going to DIY.  If you work in a \"We build everything 100% here\" shop, you'll
  find the policies useful for your own build-outs. If you are looking to partner
  with a vendor, we now can provide you with the data to demonstrate that we provide
  the best value on the market.\n \n3) Third, we saw that often prospects weren’t
  entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose neither.\n
  \nDatica is the platform on which everything is built. Compliance is the top requirement
  for all digital health applications and it's where developers looking to build or
  move to the cloud need to begin. Something like integration is built on top of the
  platform, in a complementary fashion. We didn't know how to communicate this best
  in 2015 and we probably didn't help ourselves with mountain climbing analogies later
  that year with Redpoint and Stratum. We've figured out better ways to communicate
  that we want to be your one stop shop for all your tough challenges in building
  digital health products in the cloud — above hosting and interface engines.\n \n4)
  Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of the Lean Startup movement: We want
  to talk to people.\n \nDon't worry! We're still out talking to people. We just don't
  need to bake it into all pieces of the sales process if you aren't interested anymore.
  In fact, we used a lot of feedback and discussions from customers and prospects
  to build the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica.com/dhsf/).\n \nWhile
  we made it easier to see our pricing and features, we still want to talk. It might
  be our midwestern roots, but we want to learn more about what you're working on
  and the challenges you're going through on your projects. We want to help, even
  if it means we send you along to someone else. Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://datica.com/contact/)!\n\n"

  :summary: 'As Datica has evolved, so have our pricing structures. We''re happy to
    announce that our transparent pricing is now listed on our website. '
  :blog_lead: "**August 2017 update: new pricing page** For the first three years
    we sold the Datica platform we didn't put our pricing online. We thought it was
    essential for us to interact with our customers up front and to describe how we
    differentiated ourselves from other IaaS and PaaS providers. Notably, we had to
    do a lot of education with our first customers on what it actually meant to be
    HIPAA compliant. With hundreds of customers — from startups to Fortune 100 companies
    — on the Datica platform, we now have an easy-to-understand transparent pricing
    model. Take a look at [datica.com/pricing](https://datica.com/pricing/). You might
    also want to take a read through this newer [blog article](https://datica.com/blog/why-there-is-up-front-pricing-now/)
    that explains more about why we opened up about our pricing."
  :post: "Someone the other day told us that they didn't trust us because we didn't
    have up front pricing on our website. It's the only thing we heard from them before
    they walked out the virtual door of our website. I'm sorry we didn't get a good
    chance to engage, because I would have loved to talk about why we do this.\n\nThe
    [common startup zeitgeist](https://al3x.net/2012/02/29/how-not-to-sell-software-in-2012.html)
    suggests human interaction between prospect and customer is a failure. We strongly
    believe this isn't a global maxim, at least for early-stage companies. Datica's
    found greater success in being human-centric and sales-orientated, and would like
    to share our insight.\n\nFirst, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead to
    buyer confusion. The result is frustrated prospects who now dislike the brand.
    We actually used to have a few pricing calculators on our website throughout 2014.
    We've since removed them because the way our pricing is calculated is complex.
    Complexity for the user is the enemy, even when marketing a product.\n\nWe have
    a few basic guidelines, but we've removed pricing from the up front conversation
    to focus on benefits and features. This isn't because we're trying to be disingenuous
    or hit you with some slick-back sales guy stuff; lord knows, I learned how to
    ply my trade at a place that had [virtually no sales team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/zinamoukheiber/2012/04/18/epic-systems-tough-billionaire/).\n\nSecond,
    we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges comparisons with companies
    who weren't direct competitors. It's very difficult to make an apples-to-apples
    comparison between the Datica platform and an Infrastructure vendor like AWS.
    The feature sets are way different and, more importantly, the outcomes are different.
    A most important example: AWS doesn't make you fully HIPAA compliant. Plus, we've
    incurred many costs in R&D and through licensing with 3rd party vendors to provide
    things like firewalls and vulnerability scanning as part of our offering. So,
    while we may price packages by containers or VMs, as the customer you get so much
    more and benefit from Datica being able to distribute costs across all of our
    customers.\n\nThird, we saw that often prospects weren't entirely sure which one
    of our products to choose, so they would choose neither. [Datica's platform](https://datica.com/platform/)
    is our best-in-class product to store and protect your PHI, and we offer [integration
    services](https://datica.com/services/). We'd like to know more about your startup
    and product so that we can help you pick the right one. Our competitors, to my
    knowledge, only offer one or the other. You know the saying that when all you
    have is a hammer everything looks like a nail? We're more like Home Depot. It
    sure is easy to get lost in there sometimes. Let us help you find what you need.\n\nFourth,
    we believe strongly in a core message of the [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/)
    movement: We want to talk to people. After several months, we can safely report
    back that it makes a huge difference. Four key observations came out of forcing
    conversations with prospects.\n\n- We honed in on how to best help startups. For
    newer startups, we know you might need to promise some infrastructure or get something
    started as you wait for your first contract to come through. We're willing to
    work with you so that you can deliver what you need while not breaking the bank
    up front.\n- We learned the [Datica origin story](https://datica.com/about/) is
    inspiring. I'd like to tell you about our story and our team. Why did we do this?
    What have we learned in the last few years? What benefits have our partners reaped
    from our products? We have years of healthcare and infrastructure experience at
    Datica, forged in the trenches on projects around the world. We built Datica's
    products based on what we've learned.\n- We're programmers building tools for
    programmers. If we don't do something that you want us to do, we'd like to know
    why so we can fix it or explain why we made a decision a certain way. It's hard
    to do that on one static web page.\n- We discovered Datica has a lot more to offer
    beyond just the technology. We're digital health geeks and are excited you want
    to build something to make a difference. If there's any way else we can help you
    through either introductions or sales support, we'd love to be there.  \n\nSo
    give us a chance if you want to know more about [pricing.](https://datica.com/pricing/).
    We'd love to help you out.\n\n\n"

  :summary: How are HIT vendors pricing their technologies? Why does pricing seem
    so fluid in contrast to other industry models? Find out here.
  :blog_lead: HIT vendors develop and offer services for a variety of applications,
    such as health records and e-prescribing, among others. Rising cost pressures
    affiliated with managed-care environments have been driving hospitals' adoption
    of clinical and administrative IT systems since such adoption is expected to improve
    efficiency and lower costs. What is driving these costs though? How are HIT vendors
    pricing their technologies? Why does pricing seem so fluid in contrast to other
    industry models?
  :post: |
    The power struggle between digital health vendors and enterprise customers is vastly changing due to a convergence of market, economic, and technological influences. No longer can vendors solely control how they sell and price. Now they must account for a new generation of customer that will evaluate vendor technologies by their ability to contribute value to the customer – measuring where, when, how much, and how well the technology is used. HIT vendors must be thinking of their applications as fluid platforms that permit customers to select among various technological components and pricing models.

    This new [value-based](https://datica.com/blog/marketing-value-based-care-will-generate-desired-patient-engagement-results/) licensing model is being precipitated immensely by the CIO community, and in reply, HIT vendors have complied. The inclination to begin conversations on value-based pricing roots the central shift in power that is occurring, and is now moving towards the customer's favor. The value and price of HIT solutions can be directly addressed to the business value, market value, and enterprise development cost contributions.

    * Business value – How the solution adds benefit to the customer's direct cash production (through enabled products and services) must be taken into account. Can the customer easily quantify that value? Presently, most functions cannot be directly pinpointed to their business benefit, although upcoming process management tactics and supportive technologies will make a more tangible relation.
    * Market value – If the technology's function is too far disconnected from profit generation to quantify a value, what is the market perspective of its worth based on the price of other viable options? Does the market value serve as an adequate replacement for value approximation?
    * Enterprise development cost – The enterprise cost to develop and maintain the solution itself must be heavily considered by comparing the total cost of internal development with the cost of outsourcing it.

    In this new relationship where vendor and customer share mutual responsibility for the overall effective usage of solutions, vendors must account for new sovereignty on the customer side. Buyers are going to be very preoccupied assessing the value they think each vendor uniquely brings, what the market will have in store, and what the costs are to actually implement the technology. In an industry dominated by value-based pricing models, buyers can bargain with vendors to encourage more risk sharing that is directly involved with how extensively the technology is used; for example, a customer asking the vendor adjust their per-seat price  dependent on level of usage.

    Not only are prices influenced by these value-based models. These shifts also affect how and when customers pay for their solutions. Healthcare systems already see a significant move away from up-front license purchases and toward periodical payment installments. This trend meets demands for more constant, predictable expenses during periods of stricter limits on IT spend. Savvy vendors, such as [Datica](https://datica.com/), will adjust pricing models to create a win-win relationship, where buyers can clearly see the value of solutions more directly reflected in their business processes, and vendors can then reduce their internal costs and realize more revenue from a recurring payment model.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
