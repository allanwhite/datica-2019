:summary: Who is buying patient engagement and implementing it? Hospitals. Health
  system leaders are starting venture funds and are cashing out on recapitalization.
:blog_lead: 'Back in 2013, I wrote an [article](http://histalkmobile.com/whos-buying-engagement/)
  exploring what the key stimulate for what is going to drive patient engagement funding
  and implementation, especially in the world of startups. Successful patient engagement
  holds the key to improve community health, reduce costs, and make a more positive
  healthcare experience but effectively scaling this has been a challenge since startups
  are unable to stay lucrative when going direct to consumer markets. So many companies,
  like Jiff and Keas, start out with an engagement focus and end up molding into what
  drives profit, which typically is on the employer side of patient engagement as
  the ROI is more evident and incentives are easier to align.

'
:post: "Fast forward to present day and the answer to who exactly is buying patient
  engagement and implementing it may finally be here — Hospitals. Health system leaders
  are starting venture funds and are cashing out on recapitalization because they
  truly understand healthcare. This approach is becoming more and more common among
  non-profit healthcare systems as getting in on the ground floor of new healthcare
  engagement technologies could result in some big payoffs as these funds give low
  bank interest rates and significant returns from securities. The most recent findings
  say that these fund leaders are tripling their investments over seven years. These
  investments by healthcare systems result in shortened sales cycles for patient engagement
  products and technologies by creating immediate customers. \n\nGiven that recent
  legislation is mandating hospitals to push towards value and quality of patient
  care, a growing number of hospitals are aiming to select a vendor/approach this
  year, so don’t be surprised when many healthcare systems turn into venture capital
  healthcare systems. C-Level executives and management will reap the monetary benefits
  but so will healthcare overall. A more engaged patient populace has only positive
  results forecasted. It’s an exciting day in healthcare.\n\nStay tuned throughout
  August as we continue to celebrate patient engagement. Want to know how we were
  able to help the Department of Veterans Affairs engage their patients and reach
  their goals? Read our [case study](/customer/veterans-affairs/)."
