  Healthcare entities are struggling to keep up with the demand for a growing personnel to manage and support the technological advances to electronic medical records, electronic health records, data analytics, wearable technologies, and health-monitoring devices. While this technology is streamlining healthcare to deliver more effective results, it is also increasing the need for scrutinizing HIPAA privacy and security measures.

  As most know, technology changes industries rapidly, and in healthcare, the technology is changing faster than personnel can update their skill sets. Networks are much more complicated than they were even three years ago. Security and Privacy are momentous even with standard applications but when it comes to healthcare, patients presume their information will be taken seriously.

  In order to avoid breaches or leaks, healthcare entities need to implement preventative measures rather than waiting for an incident to occur and then responding. But with the shortage of IT security professionals in the industry, this is quite difficult to accomplish.

  If you want to be sure you know the essentials to HIPAA compliance and the beginnings to becoming an IT security professional, read our [compliance guide](/guide/hipaa/).
