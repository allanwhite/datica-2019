  We highly value open-source technology at Datica. We're not only contributors to the open source community, but [open source users](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/) and [producers](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/) as well.

  One such open source project that we're absolutely thrilled to be using is [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). *Let's Encrypt* is a completely free and open source certificate authority. Developers can use *Let's Encrypt* to obtain a free SSL/TLS certificate for their websites and applications. This allows them to enable a secure connection for their users via HTTPS.
:post: |
  This summer we [announced](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005338623-Datica-Platform-3-0-Release-Notes) that all new customers would receive free *Let's Encrypt* SSL certificates for their Datica Platform environments. Additionally, any customers wanting to renew or upgrade their existing certs can also receive a free *Let's Encrypt* certificate. This feature has been amazing for our customers. Not only are these certs provided to users completely free from *Let's Encrypt*, but they're also super easy to obtain via the [Datica CLI](https://resources.datica.com/compliant-cloud/cli-reference/#certs). In addition, these certificates also automatically renew each year.

  We're proud to [support Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/donate/) in their mission to make the internet more secure. If you're looking to support an open source project this Holiday season, we couldn't think of a more worthy candidate than *Let's Encrypt.*

  :summary: Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined
    with Open-Source Connectors for the Datica Platform.
  :blog_lead: Today we are launching one-click installations of [Mirth Connect](https://www.mirth.com/)
    combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help
    solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution
    is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration
    in the best way possible.
  :post: "> Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. We aim to empower the developer community to solve
    the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
    and secure.\n\nThe launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need
    more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing
    at scale, and future-proofing for things like [FHIR](/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.\n\nDatica has been doing healthcare
    integration since October 2014, going through a [few iterations in pricing and
    packaging](/blog/announcing-self-service-and-free-trials/). Regardless of the
    iteration, our pragmatic, partnership approach remained consistent and accomplished
    a lot. In three years we built a team of experts to deliver on integrations and
    delivered over 150 live integrations into healthcare organizations, with many
    more in process. Historically it was a SaaS-based pricing model where customers
    paid a fixed fee per month per interface, per site or even an annual license to
    purchase site-based delivery. We did integration work in every major vertical:
    vendors, life sciences, healthcare organizations, and payers.\n\nTimes have changed
    since 2014 in the integration world. The cloud has gone from a taboo term in digital
    health to the default place to build 99% of new healthcare applications. FHIR
    has gone from a glimmer in [Grahame Grieve's](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1/)
    eye into an API platform that will soon be made available from most of the big
    EHRs. A new wave of digital health developers believe in openness first, even
    at hospitals as they look to commercialize IP in a digital format. There was no
    way to predict this would happen so fast (at least in healthcare, three years
    seems fast) but we are here now.\n\nOver the last three years, we learned the
    best way to help our customers was to teach them this point: there is no silver
    bullet to integration **but it is a problem you can solve with the right tools**.
    \n\nThat's why we are releasing the ability to deploy Mirth Connect with \"one-click\"
    into your [Datica environment](/platform/). You gain the expertise we've built
    on running reliable and available integration capabilities in one-click, deployed
    directly into your compliant environment on the Datica platform. Mirth, which
    is an open-source platform itself, is a great tool for software developers to
    use for integration. This is why we've written up documentation based on the hundreds
    of integrations that we've done which can teach you quickly how to [get started
    on using Mirth](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001535023-Mirth-Getting-Started).\n\n##
    Open-Source Mirth Connectors\n\nWe also [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
    for transforming data from HL7 to JSON. This is a major evolution for digital
    health teams. We do not believe in locking customers into proprietary APIs, so
    we have published everything we've learned at the transformation layer, with many
    more scripts to come. It's all in an effort to help you gain more transparency
    and confidence with [EHR integration](/discover/ehr-integrations/).\n\nThese connectors
    are a series of libraries that can be plugged into your Mirth Connect environment
    which immediately enable HL7 feeds for consumption by a restful API. We will be
    continuing to open-source content as we create it, including transformers to other
    data types like those for [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Office
    365 Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors).
    The only major limitations behind what we aim to open-source will be transforms
    which are based on vendor-specific connections or data models which we can't expose
    due to legal reasons (e.g. Epic Interconnect XML data models).\n\n## Integration
    Environment Details\n\nTake note: the integration environment is much more than
    just Mirth. Each environment has a bundle of tools important to successful integration:\n\n*
    Highly Available (HA) configuration of Mirth instances. HA operations of Mirth
    are not trivial. We make it easy, instantly.\n* HA configuration of Postgres.
    A supplemental database is important for initial message ingestion, and must support
    a similar HA nature for continuous connection.\n* Load balancers.\n* Network monitoring
    and usage alerts. Understanding the traffic usage is important for audit purposes.
    Additional alerting is important for ongoing management of a connection.\n* VPN
    Management. Remember, you do not integrate with Epic, you integrate with a specific
    site's version of Epic. Therefore you'll need a VPN for every integration you
    plan to make. Our VPN tooling makes it easy, combined with our expertise in how
    to ensure they stay connected 24/7.\n\nThe integration environment is available
    in both the [Standard and Professional plans](/pricing). The environment is not
    available for free trials (yet), but will be soon. Along with this update, we
    have now made VPN management available in the Standard plan as well, so people
    can get started with EHR integration for as low as $1,150/mo.\n\nWe're often asked
    how much throughput a typical environment can handle. The answer is _a lot_. A
    single environment with no modifications can handle as many as fifty site integrations.
    If customers need to scale throughput, they simply scale RAM. If you have any
    additional questions, [please reach out](/services/#cta). We're happy to chat.\n\n##
    Pricing Updates\n\nOne thing you may notice is that we do not bundle the integration
    environment with professional services under the name of \"Managed Integration\"
    anymore.\n\nOur customers that have greater challenges or unique needs can now
    purchase both separately since services are now optional.\n\nThis means digital
    health teams can get all the integration tooling they need — along with HITRUST
    CSF Certified, HIPAA compliant, secure infrastructure housed under one [Business
    Associate Agreement](/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    — for as little as $1,150/mo.\n\nThe other exciting news about Datica's pricing
    is that this scales much better for you. It's pricing that is truly aligned with
    your success.\n\n## The Future of Integration Is Open\n\nThis is a shift in how
    we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health
    companies. You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance
    and security, but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. This
    new option gives that to you with a single click.\n\nHealthcare developers can
    get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.
    We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration
    themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure.\n\nFor moments
    where projects seem too difficult, [our integration services team](/services)
    will be ready to jump in and help you with that lift. We see a world in which
    all of our customers can eventually own their own integrations and we want to
    provide the easiest path for customers to be able to manage that themselves. [Reach
    out](/services/#cta) if you have any questions, we'd love to help you out.\n"

  :summary: This Q&A with Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, explores what
    it means that Datica just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies.
  :blog_lead: |-
    A week ago, Chief Data Officer [Mark Olschesky](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/mark/) used Slack to announce that Datica had just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies. Of course, the company wise-crackers quickly posted the obligatory Yogi Berra response:

    > When you come to a fork in the road, take it!
  :post: "As with many technical terms, the word “fork” obviously had more than one
    meaning. The mention of this particular company achievement, along with its oddly
    referenced name suddenly had my non-technical mind driving for answers. I needed
    to uncover not only what a “fork” was, but also why having 200 of them came with
    so many “thumbs up” and “clapping hand” emoticons. The discovery called for a
    quick Q&A with none other than torchbearer himself, [Mark Olschesky](/about/mark/).
    \n\n#### Q: Just what is a “fork” in technical terms?\n\n**Mark:**  A fork is
    a term for duplicating a code or document repository. It’s not required. Someone
    could simply download the source from the repository without us knowing at all.
    In the open-source world, “forks” and “stars” are a common way to track the success
    of a project. We use [GitHub to host our policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies/);
    there, you can track all changes made to the policies by reviewing forks made
    by our customers.\n\n#### Q: Participating in open-source projects has been strategic
    for Datica, can you tell me more about its importance to the company?\n\n**Mark:**
    When the company was founded in 2013, the industry had its share of duplicitous
    vendors peddling “HIPAA-compliant” solutions for hosting and application development.
    Turns out that many of those solutions were far from compliant. As a company that,
    1) wanted to do more to make compliance in the cloud easier and, 2) was not the
    first HIPAA-compliant vendor, the company needed to go the extra mile to prove
    our compliance and differentiate the company from the rest of the market beyond
    base market copy.\n\n#### Q: How did that differentiation begin?\n\n**Mark:**
    During Datica’s first HITRUST audit, CEO Travis Good, MD saw the potential for
    sharing what we’d learned with the entire industry via open-source policies. He
    then made the following strategic decisions:\n\n- Datica should publish our policies
    in a way that allows them to be easily tracked over time (GitHub).\n- We should
    open-source the policies to both engender goodwill with the developer community
    and to also demonstrate the lengths that Datica goes for its customers versus
    other “HIPAA-compliant” vendors. \n- Provide a way for other companies with existing
    infrastructure or that didn’t want to host with Datica to fork those policies
    and make them their own. As such, we would show different flavors of how to demonstrate
    compliance with different application stacks or organizational differences.\n\n####
    Q: How does forking of our open-source policies help healthcare in general?\n\n**Mark:**
    As a company, Datica does not manage all the parts of HIPAA. For example, we don’t
    employ clinicians or have software that performs medical decision-making or automated
    outreach to patients. As such, it’s hard for our policies to be the definitive
    guide for “what it means to be HIPAA compliant.”\n\n#### Q: That sounds counterintuitive
    to the ultimate goal of HIPAA compliance. Can you explain how forks play into
    that?\n\n**Mark:** By looking at forks, you can see what other customers have
    done. Most commonly, you can see companies with different Business Associate Agreements
    (BAAs). You’ll also see some major material differences through the forks. \n\n####
    Q: Can you give me a good example of a fork?\n\n**Mark:** One is Bind. As an insurer/broker
    (and therefore likely a [Covered Entity](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    their policies will differ from Datica’s as a cloud infrastructure/tooling provider.
    Bind’s willingness to share what they’ve done could help other insurers or brokers
    with their path to build and demonstrate compliance. That can save everyone time
    and money. That savings allows organizations to work on the real problems in healthcare.\n\n####
    Q: When the 200th fork came in from the Chief Technology Officer of a care coordination
    platform, you shared this good news with the entire company. Why was this an important
    achievement?\n\n**Mark:** Many open-source projects don’t receive much attention,
    so it’s great to see that Datica’s open-sourced policies are one of the more popular
    open source projects in healthcare compliance. The Linux Foundation took a similar
    approach a year later in [publishing their policies](https://github.com/lfit/itpol).
    Datica is proud to be one of the earlier innovators in a space that facilitates
    transparency in best practices by publishing those policies. As a company we strive
    to constantly do what’s best for our customers, but also the industry as a whole.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
