:summary: To understand how to best design health information technologies for utility,
  their true purpose must be understood as it relates to patient engagement.
:blog_lead: "The utility of healthcare technologies is exceedingly pertinent for lively
  and continual [patient engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement),
  but individual preferences and conjectures must be taken into consideration when
  design decisions are made. There have been no specific criterion released to offer
  support to the [patient engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement)
  process but there are emerging directions seen across the industry. But first, to
  thoroughly understand these disciplines, the purpose of health information technologies
  must be understood as it relates to [patient engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement).
  \n"
:post: "The roles of these technologies in promoting the inherent engagement process
  can be broken down into two objectives:\n\n1. Health technologies are intended to
  favor the structure of the health experience using goals, rules, and feedback.\n2.
  Health technologies are meant to supplement the recovery experience by allowing
  individuals a higher level of awareness of their behaviors and consequences. \n\nPositive
  psychology with a primary focus on individual experience is a quickly emerging theme
  being employed to guide engagement efforts. And from this perspective, [patient
  engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement) can be conceptualized
  as an intuitive experiential activity resulting from cognitive, conative, and emotional
  impositions from individuals in professional care. When done correctly, health information
  technologies will promote an effective synergy among these three dimensions. A focus
  on positive technology can improve the quality of the patient experience by advocating
  certain strategies to adjust each of the dimensions involved while simultaneously
  stimulating patient motivation and engagement in the process. \n\nThe first goal
  of these technologies is addressed by offering patients a sense of purpose, narrowing
  attention, and positioning engagement in the experience. By deposing obvious obstacles,
  subjects are pushed to see the experience from a different perspective. The feedback
  will tell individuals how near they are to achieving goals while providing motivation
  to continue. \n\nThe second goal, to supplement the recovery process, is done by
  offering external indications to allow patients an awareness of their behaviors
  and consequences. Because technology has multi-sensory capabilities, it is possible
  to create an augmented reality that triggers multiple senses in unison. \n\nOverall,
  healthcare information technology professionals need to consider the quality of
  experience and a “positive focus” when designing and implementing products in order
  to truly contribute to [patient engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement).\n\n"
