:summary: Our newest publication Rethinking Healthcare Technology includes expansive,
  useful, and original essays on digital transformation from insightful leaders.
:blog_lead: That's the most important question clinicians are asking themselves in
  a post-EHR world where patients have supercomputers in their pockets, and they expect
  the same high-quality, on-demand experiences the Apples, Googles, Amazons, and Facebooks
  give them.
:post: "\nA world where doctors are spending more time looking at a screen than engaging
  with the patient.\n\nA world where wearables are creating a glut of data, some useful
  but most of it useless, and none of it fits into the EHR seamlessly.\n\nBut especially
  a world where innovators and entrepreneurs have never been more equipped with ideas,
  access to funding, and technology doubling in power every few years. These innovators
  are poised to help transform healthcare, but something in the industry, something
  in the system is slowing them down or holding them back.\n\nDatica explored the
  question of \"how does technology actually make an impact?\" in a series of interviews
  with influential thinkers and doers. The result is a publication of essays called,
  [“Rethinking Healthcare Technology.”](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/leadership-gallery/)

  :summary: Dr. Naomi Fried shared her ideas on the differences in innovation between
    pharma and hospitals, and opportunities for digital health vendors in pharma.
  :blog_lead: "Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare
    innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most
    recently, as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External
    Partnerships, she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients
    and healthcare professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation
    beyond the molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients
    and providers. \n\nIn our [July, 2017 podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/naomi-fried-how-digital-health-companies-can-help-pharma-innovate/)
    Travis Good, MD interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences
    between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages
    digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways
    from the podcast. "
  :post: "\n> A whole world of opportunity exists for startups to bring new digital
    ideas into the market. Digital health vendors should be seeking out pharma for
    expertise and advice and working with providers to get to patient populations
    and to bring these new ideas forward to us. - Dr. Naomi Fried, Founder and CEO,
    [Health Innovation Strategies](http://www.healthinnovationstrategies.com/)\n\n##
    Pharma companies are slower to innovate than hospitals \n\nInnovation centers
    are prevalent throughout today’s healthcare ecosystem. But when innovation at
    Pharma companies is compared to innovation at hospitals and large health systems,
    hospitals cross the finish line first. “When it comes to testing and implementing
    patient-facing innovations, particularly new digital health tools, I think providers
    generally move more quickly,” says Fried. “They are closer to the patient, with
    fewer regulatory barriers to navigate around. So they tend to be more likely to
    jump in and try things. I’d say when it comes to [digital health innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/)
    for patients, hospitals are probably actually a bit ahead of pharma.”\n\n## Digital
    health vendors and pharma should partner\n\nInnovation in the pharmaceutical industry
    is fueled by both internal development and the external development taking place
    in digital health startups across the globe. The fastest path to innovation is
    in the partnerships being developed between the two. “Digital health companies
    usually have specialized domain knowledge,” Fried comments. “Tech-savvy, entrepreneurial
    startups tend to have a consumer bent and are better at developing user experiences
    and consumer-oriented solutions than large pharma companies.”\n\n> Digital health
    startups generally move more quickly and often develop products in months rather
    than years, and they can also make changes quickly and respond to feedback they
    get.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, pharma companies can help [digital health
    vendors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/) get past some of the healthcare-specific hurdles
    to get their products to market faster. Fried explains, “Digital health startups
    can leverage and learn from pharma's well-established processes around healthcare
    industry-specific details. Those include things like CPT coding and thinking about
    payer reimbursement. They don't have to reinvent the wheel or invest heavily in
    developing regulatory expertise but really can look to a pharma partner who can
    help them leapfrog to where they are going.”\n\n“Where startups lack the infrastructure
    needed to reach customers and have trouble scaling up, this is something that
    pharmaceutical companies have done well. So I think that teaming up with pharmaceutical
    companies and tapping their extensive marketing infrastructures and distribution
    channels can really help digital startups get traction, much faster than they
    could if they were on their own.”\n\n## The three biggest opportunities for digital
    health products\n\nDr. Fried describes three areas within digital health patient
    care that improve value and have the potential to reduce costs.\n\n### 1. Medication
    adherence\n\nMedication adherence has a big effect on outcomes and is supported
    and driven by digital tools. “When patients are more compliant in taking their
    medications, the stakeholders — doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and payers
    — all benefit. I think medication adherence is one of the Holy Grails in healthcare.
    Getting patients to take their medications at the right time, with the right dosage
    for a condition can really save costs and improve patient outcomes,” explains
    Fried.\n\n### 2. Digital diagnosis and prediction\n\nA cost savings to the system
    and better outcomes for the patients make diagnosis and prediction technology
    a winning opportunity for digital health vendors to explore.  Fried explains by
    example, “Prophylactically taking medication that will avoid an asthma attack
    may mean a patient takes more drugs at a certain time. But the net result is a
    lower cost for the overall episode or even no episode at all, avoiding expenses
    like a trip to the emergency department.”\n\n### 3. Digiceuticals\n\nThese are
    digital therapies that treat a patient for a condition in addition to, or instead
    of, a traditional pharmaceutical solution. Fried says, “They can either be complementary
    to medication or they may even have the potential to substitute for medication.
    An example of a complementary digiceutical would be a pain management app that
    goes along with pain medication that a patient might take after surgery. This
    could result in the patient needing less medication or healing more quickly. An
    example of a substitute digiceutical is a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD). Kids could use these apps rather than taking a medication.”\n\n>
    I think digiceuticals will clearly drive improved outcomes and lower the cost
    of healthcare with digital health solutions that bring value in addition to medication.
    I think that the complementary and synergistic effects of digital health with
    medications are a net-win for patients, for pharma, and also for the payers.\n\nTune

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
