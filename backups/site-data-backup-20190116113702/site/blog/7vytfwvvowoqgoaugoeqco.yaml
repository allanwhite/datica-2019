  :summary: We recap the second half of the AWS Re:Invent conference with a look at
    how some of the announcements could be applicable to the healthcare domain.
  :blog_lead: "## A recap of the AWS re:Invent keynotes\n    \nWe're returning from
    three and a half days at the re:invent conference. It was an extraordinary event
    both in terms of the number of people attending but also in terms of the calibre
    and diversity of the attendees. I had some conversations where people reminisced
    about how re:invent has come to be **the** IT conference and has taken over the
    mantle from VMWorld. It also helps that the brands making presentations and sharing
    their knowledge are acknowledged leaders in their industry _viz_ Netflix (entertainment),
    Merck (life sciences), FINRA (finance), Twilio (messaging), Mapbox (mapping),
    enterprise IT (VMWare and Workday), McDonald's (fast food) and more. Every presentation
    in the keynote has slides filled with logos of major brands in every industry
    you can imagine. Each of the keynotes—the first by CEO Andy Jassy and the second
    by CTO Werner Vogels—were about two and a half hours long. Each was filled with
    product announcements and interspersed with customer presentations, all of which
    were illuminating and funny at times as well. The Snowmobile announcement, for
    one, was sheer showmanship (it was driven onto stage) and remains memorable for
    every attendee. It was also parked right next to our booth in the exhibit hall
    and had a constant stream of people coming by to take selfies and pose with it."
  :post: "![IMG 4343](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1enTmTaXO0e66UYSaIOiCI/a92c59be15c6ba00f63e1dd7d9492fb7/IMG_4343.jpg)\n\nWhile
    both keynotes were interesting from a technology perspective, I felt that it would
    be worthwhile to condense it down and explore how some of these announcements
    could be applicable to the healthcare domain.\n\n## Possible healthcare impact
    from major product announcements made and \n\n### EC2 instance sizes\n\n[EC2 instances][3]
    that are bigger, smaller and programmable were announced, to satisfy the least
    and the most compute / memory / storage hungry software. Some of these were geared
    to keep AWS way ahead of it's competitors and others such as [LightSail][4] (the
    preconfigured virtual private server - VPS) seemed to be directly targeted at
    niches serviced by companies like Digital Ocean. \n\nThis is important for healthcare
    and life sciences. As I wrote about [before][5], one of the primary use cases
    that the healthcare industry is focused on is big data analytics, which necessarily
    implies large scale data analysis which in turn requires pretty large scale machines.
    Given that elasticity is also possible with these machines, things such as genomic
    analysis and outcomes analysis is likely to benefit substantially. At the other
    end of the spectrum, smaller instances will allow innovation and other groups
    to dip their toes into the cloud or try out ideas quickly and cheaply.\n\n###
    AI and ML as an API\n\n[Rekognition][6] (image analysis and detection), [Polly][7]
    (text to voice with intelligence) and [Lex][8] (voice based AI and interaction),
    all accessible via an API were announced. Machine Learning (ML) via an API and
    UI was announced earlier with these new products now being able to be used in
    concert. While some believe that Google has a lead in the AI space given it's
    history and access to vast troves of data, AWS seems to be focusing it's efforts
    on enabling specific use cases that customers might have in specific domains and
    offering up the technology it uses internally in products such as Alexa / Echo.
    All of this seems to be in response to Google's announcements earlier about the
    availability of its solutions, it does seem that in conjunction with the data
    movement and compute solutions, AWS might be in a position to catch up with Google
    in this regard. It does seem like this is an attempt to also make the technology
    more ubiquitous and thus the de-facto. I wouldn't be surprised to see ML and AI
    models developed by customers made available to others on the AWS marketplace
    in a little while. \n\nAI and ML is, of course, extremely applicable to healthcare.
    Reams of data is available within EHRs, PACS, PBM systems, pharmacies and claims
    management systems. However, analyzing all this data requires the right set of
    people. Both from a deployment and ongoing system management perspective but also,
    even more importantly, from the data science perspective. Other industries are
    also jumping into the data fray which makes it very challenging to staff up on
    both the devOps as well as the data science roles. The above mentioned solution
    is an attempt by AWS to try and simplify access to this somewhat esoteric of fields.
    I would predict academic hospitals with its set of medical informaticists, medical
    students and researchers, seeing immediate use for this capability. Specifically
    Rekognition and the ML API...\n\nOn the consumer side too, we can expect to see
    Lex (with voice based commands to summon the nurse, control the temperature, raise
    and lower the bed, capturing patient feedback and many more) being put to use
    in various ways in hospitals and Polly on the web or inside clinical applications.
    The possibilities are quite staggering.\n\n### Embedded IoT software aka Greengrass\n\nAs
    a preloaded piece of software onto IoT chips and with pre-built security, AWS
    Lambda links, local storage and orchestration amongst devices, [Greengrass][9]
    was a major announcement that is very timely. Especially given the recent DDoS
    attacks initiated via IoT devices and also that the IoT trend is not slowing down
    anytime soon. \n\nDevices already exist within health systems and have been [recognized][10]
    to be very insecure. The capabilities described can make Greengrass the foundation
    for another generation of more intelligent and secure healthcare IoT devices.\n\n###
    VMWare Cloud on AWS\n\nThis had to have been one of the most significant [announcements][11]
    re enterprise IT. VMWare cloud (vMotion), vSphere (compute), NSX (networking)
    and vSAN (storage) are all deployed on bare metal machines on AWS. Enterprise
    IT teams used to working in the VMWare world can now move seamlessly from one
    to the other. This is likely to speed up adoption of the AWS cloud significantly.
    There was no mention of exclusivity from VMWare so we can expect to see similar
    announcements coming soon from Azure and Google.\n\nHealthcare and life sciences
    are still in the early stages of the move to the cloud but this VMWare cloud on
    AWS could be just the thing that could act as the catalyst to accelerate that
    movement. However, the issues around compliance (HIPAA, HITRUST and GxP) remain
    open and need to be addressed. We do see this as an area of opportunity for us.\n\n###
    Cloud-first data management tools\n\n[Step Functions][12] (workflow management),
    [Glue][13] (ETL), [Athena][14] (S3 querying) were all geared towards enabling
    and simplifying data movement and massaging needed to enable analytics and machine
    learning capabilities. With expanding capabilities, it does seem that AWS could
    be considered competitive to companies such as Mulesoft. \n\nThis is pretty significant
    in that this is billed only a use basis, which implies that you no longer have
    to buy expensive upfront licenses but only as needed. This can have an immediate
    impact for healthcare startups as well as for the innovation groups in healthcare
    institutions.\n\n### Automatic DDoS protection\n\n[Shield][15] was a great announcement
    which essentially provides **all** AWS customers with core DDoS protection (volumetric
    and TCP) automatically and for no extra charge. Advanced versions are also available
    of course at a higher price. But this free offering is a great first step to address
    the concerns that some customers have raised with us as well. While it makes marketing
    sense, it also makes sound business sense to AWS because DDoS attacks on any of
    their customer accounts will have a cascading impact on other customer's workloads
    and secondly, there are bound to be issues with the final bill post attacks. \n\nThis
    further removes the security concerns felt by CIOs and CISOs in health systems
    and plans especially given that basic protection is automatically put into place
    and leverages the cumulative man-years of knowledge that AWS has in protecting
    it's own and it's customer's infrastructure.\n\n### Easier data transfer to the
    cloud\n\nI wrote about the challenge that a lot of the customer's continue to
    face in moving data to the cloud from their datacenters in the [previous post][5].
    This has been addressed by using much larger capacity [Snowballs][16] with some
    enhancements and compute ability and for very large data transfers measured in
    exabytes, a tractor trailer sized device, called the [Snowmobile][17].\n\n## Summary\n\nTwo
    key points.\n\n1. With a revenue run rate of $15 Billion—and a projected growth
    rate of 55% YoY that as a business size dwarfs the next 14 competitors put together—the
    AWS business is enormous.\n\n2. The move to the cloud, while not in it's infancy,
    is only just in it's pre-teen years.\n\nWe can expect to see AWS as the market
    leader and the de-facto choice of many of the CIOs in healthcare. Given Amazon's
    history of expanding into related spaces, it is not surprising to see it expand
    into domains led by companies by New Relic, Digital Ocean and Mulesoft. While
    AWS' offerings might not be as full featured as the established, we can safely
    predict that in a year or less, they are likely to be at feature parity which
    should be a source of concern for those companies.\n\nThe healthcare industry
    can leverage a lot of these new capabilities. We expect to see immediate uptake
    on the larger machine sizes for big data and analytics, short term uptake on the
    ML and AI toolsets especially in academic healthcare and medium to long term adoption
    of the Greengrass toolkit for innovative device development and use. \n\nIt will
    be interesting to see how Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM SoftLayer, and others do
    to counter next year.\n\n[3]: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\n[4]:

  :summary: 'Day 3 of re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing Fargate
    among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we''re excited about Fargate?

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
    dir=\"ltr\">No longer any need to manage servers and clusters for your containers
    - AWS Fargate - Run ECS and EKS without managing servers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reInvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reInvent</a>
    <a href=\"https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL\">https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lZnS558CXV\">pic.twitter.com/lZnS558CXV</a></p>&mdash;
    AWS re:Invent (@AWSreInvent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/935910336212844544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November
    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"

  :blog_lead: It's the second day of [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
    and sessions are in full swing. I was able to attend several healthcare track
    sessions yesterday ([including Datica's](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/
    "Datica's AWS presentation")) and the future looks bright. Healthcare is poised
    to fully embrace the cloud in 2018. The sentiment in the market has changed and
    it truly feels like we're on the edge of a major shift in the approach healthcare
    organizations are taking when building and hosting their software.
  :post: |-
    Transitioning to today, the sessions were a bit different — but just as exciting. I attended three talks that discussed cutting edge fields that will have a major impact on healthcare in the next 5 to 10 years. Unlike healthcare's adoption of the cloud in 2018, these new technologies will likely take a bit longer, but that's not stopping us from getting excited.

    ![AWS services and partners](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/58k6RGB8ZOCOYA0eCqguaG/ded251d67b941cfce7ab20b66b4bde43/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__4_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The first session I attended was the __Global Partner Summit Keynote__, which was packed with several thousand attendees. We learned about several new initiatives and programs for Amazon Partners ([Datica is an APN member, as well as a healthcare competency partner](https://aws.amazon.com/health/healthcare-partners/#Datica)). These new changes will have a profound impact on how we work with our customers — from VPC sharing to new ways to integrate with the AWS marketplace. We'll be announcing new ways to take advantage of both Datica and AWS in the future.

    ![AWS Hyperledger Sawtooth Blockchain](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4rNlSQgtjaIuQYkUAI8iGU/7c052bd02b0d178e924d441a07801759/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__3_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    Session number two was entirely focused on [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSP-taqLWPQ) and blockchain technologies on AWS. We saw Intel present on [Sawtooth/Hyperledger](https://hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) (a competitor to [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)) which is governed by the Linux foundation. Healthcare veterans like PokitDok use Sawtooth to enable their blockchain technology, [DokChain](https://dokchain.com/). We're excited to watch blockchain technology grow within healthcare.

    ![AWS Neural networking](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6cDub9PA3KwQciuekA80IU/083cf25a67e696875daa420db63ea44e/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__2_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The last session of the day was on Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. This was by far the most exciting talk of the day. There are several real world use cases that make sense for both Datica and Datica customers. From menial tasks like filling out 1500+ question security questionnaires, to providing smart analytics and predictive scoring for compliance, machine learning is a very real topic that we're exploring deeply at Datica.

    If you were in attendance for any of the these sessions and want to chat about AI, Blockchain or how Datica provides an unparalleled compliance experience on AWS, stop by booth #519.

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica.com/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    <figcaption>Datica Shared Responsibility Model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

    heaven. Developers can deploy application workloads to their Datica environment
    instead of directly to AWS to eliminate the burden of compliance. With the Datica
    Platform, you get all the great benefits of AWS as the foundation our platform,
    plus Datica automates all DevOps and DevSecOps requirements on the cloud. With
    AWS + Datica, developers can deploy AWS services & workloads in minutes that are

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica

    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
