:summary: Datica customers and innovators Cota, Clockwise.MD, and Arcadia Healthcare
  are making waves in healthcare and we're excited to share their stories.
:blog_lead: |
  We love sharing the amazing and diverse stories of Datica customers through both [spotlights and case studies](https://datica.com/proof/). Their origin stories, visions on how to change healthcare, and traction are all so compelling, and surprisingly diverse. It reminds us of the vastness of healthcare; the industry is full of things to be fixed, and there is no shortage of innovators ready to step up.

  These three innovators — Cota, Clockwise.MD, and Arcadia Healthcare — the subjects of our most recent customer spotlights, are making waves in healthcare and we're excited to share their stories.
:post: |
  ## Cota: Fundamentally changing how data informs every healthcare decision

  Three years ago, [Cota](https://www.cotahealthcare.com/), a New York-based digital health company had three employees. Now, the company is using the minds of nearly 100 employees to solve one of the most difficult problems in healthcare — finding a way to provide a universal data model for healthcare to help physicians improve the standards of care. Ultimately, the company seeks to make changes not just to fundamentally change how clinicians use data and make decisions in healthcare, but to accelerate the pace of research in academic networks, and provide real-world evidence to pharmaceutical companies developing cancer-fighting treatments. As the company works to solve this challenge, it is producing a significant amount of research in the field and has been published in 15 peer-reviewed journals and delivered presentations at multiple industry conferences.

  > [Read the rest](https://datica.com/customer/cota/#spotlight) of the Cota Spotlight to learn how Cota turned patient data into useable insights at scale, and their plans to expand beyond oncology.

  ## Clockwise.MD: Improving patient satisfaction with timing technology

  Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot, UPS — those are likely the business names that first come to mind when one mentions Atlanta. Yet, entrepreneurs and innovators are now the talk of the town with their kudzu-like startup growth. In 2013, startup Founder Michael Burke launched [Clockwise.MD](https://www.clockwisemd.com/) at the [Atlanta Tech Village (ATV)](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), with help from co-founders Phillip Han and Phong Si. ATV is a wonderful mix between incubator/accelerator and coworking space where roughly 225 other startups work to build their companies. At that time, Atlanta also had nine of the nation’s top health IT companies, which put it on track to become one of the top five US tech hub cities.

  Now relocated across the street from Georgia Tech, Clockwise.MD taps technology talent from the university to expand and improve its online scheduling and wait time transparency solutions for healthcare organizations. Recognized in 2016 as a Best Place to Work in Atlanta and a Healthcare Hero by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the co-founders at Clockwise.MD have nailed down a healthcare solution that hit at the right time and in the right place.

  > [Continue reading](https://datica.com/customer/clockwisemd/#spotlight) to learn what Michael Burke and his co-founders learned about patient experience, and about being in the right place at the right time.

  ## Arcadia Healthcare Solutions: Bringing value-based performance management to the healthcare organizations changing the industry

  Of healthcare’s structural problems, connecting data in the absence of sufficient standards looms large. By stepping in to fill the gap as a trusted connector, Boston-based [Arcadia Healthcare Solutions](http://www.arcadiasolutions.com/) is a leader at solving the massive data problems in healthcare that prevent both big and small organizations from having a meaningful impact.

  Arcadia was founded in 2002 as a consulting firm primarily focused on insurers. Their specialty was systems integration throughout their first five years of existence.

  Eventually in 2008 they started working on more tooling for a mix of health systems, independent provider groups and health plans, which lead to version 1.0 of the Arcadia Analytics platform. They built a deep expertise in [Electronic Health Record (EHR) and claims data integration](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/) and supporting technology. That led to a conscious pivot in 2012 to a technology-first, SaaS-based analytics company.

  And they haven’t looked back since. Arcadia augmented their analytics technology strengths with two acquisitions in 2011 and 2015 to build EHR infrastructure and managed care capabilities. Arcadia now connects 18 of the top 20 EHR platforms, have hundreds of live connections updated nightly, and work with premier health systems, health plans, and accountable care organizations across the country.

  > [Read on](https://datica.com/customer/arcadia-healthcare-solutions/#spotlight) to learn how Arcadia developed the right mix of experience and progressiveness.

    It got to the point where we knew these stories had to be shared. We would have feel-good moments each time we heard how a customer was truly making a dent in the universe, and wanted to pass those moments onto you.

    So what are these spotlights?

    Unlike traditional "case studies" focusing on jointly achieved outcomes, each spotlight strictly highlights the story of our customer; they have nothing to do with Datica. Instead, we catalog their founding origin stories, broadcast their vision of the future of healthcare, and share in their successes to date. Their efforts to better healthcare deserve their own platform.

    Today five spotlights are available, but more are on the way. The positive response by customers has been fantastic—everyone we've asked has said YES! to being profiled.

    * [Purple Binder][1]: Technology that bridges healthcare systems and social services to impact patient outcomes
    * [CareMessage][2]: Using technology to connect lower-income patients with caring providers
    * [Community Services for the Deaf][3]: Innovative Technologies Protect Personal Health Information and Expand Employment Opportunity
    * [DispatchHealth][4]: A company at the epicenter of the shift to value-based care as it redefines healthcare delivery
    * [Healthfinch][5]: Using technology to automate, delegate and simplify repeatable clinical tasks

    Take a look at our first five spotlights, and keep an eye on many more in the works.

    If you are an existing customer and want to share your story, send us an email at [hello@datica.com][6] to get the conversation started.

    > "Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives – choice, not chance, determines your destiny." — Aristotle

    Metabahn and HealthLoop are two vastly different companies that have the Datica common denominator. On one side, we have Metabahn, an Alabama-based agency of developers and designers determined to bring open source tools to healthcare. On the other, HealthLoop, a Mountain View, Calif. based health IT company that keeps doctors, patients and caregivers connected between visits with insightful, actionable and engaging information delivered via a cloud-based platform that automates follow-up care.

    **We are proud to establish partnerships with both of these companies and are even prouder that they chose us in opposition to many alternatives the marketplace has to offer. For them, it was a no-brainer. Don't take our word for it though. Read about their perspective in our recently released case studies on both companies.**

    Why now? Because there's no better time than now.

  :summary: Prior to DocbookMD® HIPAA-secure communication didn't exist. Datica was
    not only able to centralize integration for DocbookMD but also save them $360K.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Doctors need HIPAA-secure communication if they are to share [critical patient information][1] and collaborate with medical colleagues. That's what rural primary care doctor [Tracey Haas, MD][2] discovered as she practiced in an area that didn't even have a cardiologist or orthopedic surgeon. HIPAA regulations tied her hands whenever she looked at a patient EKG or X-ray and needed a real-time expert opinion from another doctor, like her husband, orthopedic surgeon [Dr. Tim Gueramy][3]. Prior to the start of [DocbookMD®][4], a secure way to communicate physician-to-physician didn't exist, so doctors, including Haas and Gueramy struggled to provide immediate and efficient care to patients.

    **When the first [iPhone®][5] came out in 2007, [_sans_][6][ camera][6], apps or app store, Haas and Gueramy began talking to other doctors to build the first use cases for DocbookMD, which went from directory app upon its launch in 2009 to communication app and finally to today's iteration -- a critical collaboration platform.**

    Healthcare has a cornocopia of information in a multitude of forms: patient records, medical images, prescriptions, patient bills, insurance claims and data research. Healthcare organizations not only must securely store data but they are mandated to process and cater to this data using a variety of data management and process solutions. If that isn't enough, healthcare providers are also required to have this data available on demand and through boundaries, whilst simultaenously focusing on the core principles of patient care delivery. DocbookMD needed a partner in order to comply with these industry necessities.

    In dealing with an early-stage company, companies often get a mixed bag with performance. However, Haas said that Datica exceeded expectations with zero problems, which has created a positive experience for everyone, especially engineering. Gueramy states that four factors played into the company's decision to go with the [Datica cohesive approach to integration][7] versus building a solution themselves:

    1. **The Datica business model** — "It's cloud-based and exactly like our business model."
    2. **Enabled DocbookMD to scale **—"That was a big one!"
    3. **Allowed the company a way to capture what future costs were going to be** \-- "That provided a way to charge our customers more appropriately and keep our costs down."
    4. **Datica being physician-based** — "That was huge."

    Want to know more about how Datica was not only able to centralize integration for DocbookMD but also save them $360K? Read how in our [Docbook MD Case Study][8], available now.

    Health Cloud can now cover the infrastructure obligations of HIPAA.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Healthcare data requires the utmost level of security and integrity. [Protected Health Information (PHI)][1] isn't just random data; it's a real person's medical history so dedication to compliance and security is critical. Unfortunately the commitment to security and privacy has lead to the data being difficult to fully utilize. With that industry hurdle, Datica automates much of the compliance burden put on technical teams. We are proud to announce that with a single [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)][2], healthcare customers of [Microsoft Azure][3] and [Salesforce Health Cloud][4] can now cover the infrastructure obligations of HIPAA, freeing them to focus on their core competencies.

    We were very excited to discover both Salesforce and Microsoft Azure, prominent cloud vendors normally outside of healthcare, are entering healthcare with their service offerings. If done correctly, both can be meaningful workflow softwares that can be leveraged by organizations across the industry. Existing Azure and Salesforce Health Cloud customers now have the option to utilize Datica's specialized and respected approach to HIPAA compliance.

    As we know, integration is not easy, as it requires not only understanding healthcare specific mappings and standards ([HL7][5], CCD, [FHIR][6]…) but also context and business process enablement. It's an undertaking very different from every other industry. Both cloud service providers must solve the integration puzzle in order to reach their full potential. Datica is the premier integration and compliance partner. We bring the domain expertise to the gate of these clouds so vendors and health systems can both maximize their utility and value.

    Our relationship is simple. Organizations looking to leverage Salesforce Health Cloud or Microsoft Azure need to integrate external datasets, likely from third party tools. Those integrations need to be done in a compliant, efficient and contextual manner. Trust is paramount and precision critical, and Datica Redpoint becomes the trusted integration partner to aggregate those datasets into the cloud.

    We are excited to continue to push innovation within healthcare. Our focal point on data security and integrity is essential to driving progress. Our partnership with Salesforce Health Cloud and Microsoft Azure is a shining example of a progressive path forward for healthcare.
