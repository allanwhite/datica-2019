:summary: Catalyze was made aware of a code execution exploit that affects bash, but
  no systems have been compromised, and a patch is released.
:blog_lead: '1. Catalyze was made aware of a code execution exploit that affects bash.

'
:post: "2. No catalyze systems have been compromised.\r\n3. A patch was released,
  but was found incomplete. A new revised issue was created.\r\n4. Catalyze is deploying
  the revised patch to all containers and systems.\r\n\r\n#### Overview:\r\n\r\nCatalyze
  was made aware of the critical code execution exploit \"Shellshock\" [CVE-2014-6271](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271)
  and [CVE-2014-7169](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169).
  In accordance with our [policies](https://catalyze.io/policy/#catalyze-breach-policy),
  we are notifying you of the situation and this correspondence details the steps
  that Catalyze will be taking. At this time, no systems have been compromised, but
  we feel that its important to detail the situation.\r\n\r\n#### What is CVE-2014-6271
  \"ShellShock\":\r\n\r\nFrom [National Vulnerability Database](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271):\r\n\r\n>
  GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the
  values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand
  feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server,
  scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting
  the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka \"ShellShock.\"
  NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned
  to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.\r\n\r\n####
  What is Bash?\r\n\r\nFrom [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\\(Unix_shell\\)):\r\n\r\n>
  Bash is a Unix shell written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software
  replacement for the Bourne shell (sh). Released in 1989, it has been distributed
  widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on Linux
  and Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n#### How does this affect you?\r\n\r\nCustomer containers that
  do not run customer application code are not impacted by this exploit.  By design,
  the Catalyze Platform does not expose direct access to containers, including ssh
  or bash.  CGI execution is not allowed.\r\n\r\nIf application code deployed on the
  platform relies on invoking shell commands or bash scripts please contact us immediately
  at [support@catalyze.io](mailto:support@catalyze.io) so we can investigate if this
  further.\r\n\r\n#### How is Catalyze addressing this exploit?\r\n\r\nCanonical has
  released updates [usn-2363](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2351-1/) and [usn-2363-2](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2363-2/)
  for Ubuntu 14.04, 12.04 and 10.04.   These patches upgrade bash to version 4.3-7ubuntu1.3
  which includes fixes for both [CVE-2014-6271](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271)
  and [CVE-2014-7169](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169).\r\n\r\nCatalyze
  engineers are in the process of testing the patch and will deploy the fix to all
  platform containers and platform hosts.\r\n\r\n#### Further reading on CVE-2014-6271
