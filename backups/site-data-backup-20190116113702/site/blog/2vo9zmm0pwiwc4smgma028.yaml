  it evolve through this process, from company branding and product name changes to
  updates to the Academy, Blog, and other resources. Today, I’m pleased to share the
  latest and greatest version. \n\nHere are a few of the highlights of what’s new
  at Datica.com:\n\n## Compliant Kubernetes Service\n\n<img class=\"float-right thumbnail
  lozad\" data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5WYWIEoNNKEMi08AwCIYM8/72eb1ec13bfe2c79f2c329781505565a/cks-thumb.jpg?w=300\"
  width=\"150\" alt=\"CKS\" />\n\n[Compliant Kubernetes Service](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-kubernetes-service/)
  (CKS) product page. We recently relaunched our compliant cloud product, moving it
  from the legacy PaaS platform to the much more scalable, open, and flexible Kubernetes
  service. We’ve written about the differences between a [PaaS and Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/)
  in case you’re wondering why we made the move to Kubernetes. The new CKS page will
  hopefully answer all your questions about the key features and benefits of the Datica
  CKS. When you’re ready for more details, you can easily schedule a demo right from
  that page.\n\n## Compliant Managed Integration\n\n<img class=\"float-right thumbnail
  lozad\" data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/13fTTGMl9YWcCCoOgicaII/8c6de55e6cfde58ad27824938ee57b74/integration-thumb.jpg?w=300\"
  width=\"150\" alt=\"Integration\" />\n\n[Compliant Managed Integration](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-managed-integration/)
  (CMI) product page. With millions of monthly messages passed through Datica’s platform
  from more than 200 sites, we have the track record to understand the intricacies
  of integrating with an EMR system. This new CMI product page details the full suite
  of integration tooling you need to successfully complete an integration product
  with a clinical site. You can schedule a call with a Datica expert right from that
  page to get your integration project started.\n\n## Datica Webinars\n\n<img class=\"float-right
  thumbnail lozad\" data-src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4fOHWZhIggmsICuggKm8m0/cad2048e8f83456f67881149b2cf3d82/webinars-thumb.jpg?w=300\"
  width=\"150\" alt=\"Webinars\" />\n\n[Webinars](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/webinars/) are
  now recorded and available for you to watch anytime. If you’re trying to understand
  how Kubernetes fits into the big picture of compliance, you might be interested
  in watching two recent webinars by our CTO & CSO, Christopher Gerg. Start with [Kubernetes
  and Healthcare Compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/webinars/kubernetes-and-healthcare-compliance/)
  for a general overview of how Datica makes Kubernetes clusters compliant to HIPAA,
  HITRUST, GxP, GDPR, and SOC 2 requirements, then watch [Kubernetes and HITRUST compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/webinars/kubernetes-and-hitrust-compliance/)
  to get more specifics about deploying a Datica CKS cluster how we make HITRUST CSF
  certification possible on Kubernetes. You’ll also find other webinars of interest
  from multiple Datica compliance and integration experts on the new webinar page.\n\n##
  Discover Compliance Topics\n\nThe [Discover Pages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/)
  aren’t as new as some of the other pages but are worth pointing out in case you’ve
  missed them. Here, you’ll find resource hubs devoted to specific topics, such as
  [HIPAA Compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/), [GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/),
  [HIPAA Compliance on AWS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), and more. These
  hubs serve as central informational repositories, compiled by topic,  for the educational
  content from the [Datica Academy](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/), [Innovation Hub](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/),

  :summary: If you're new to container orchestration and more familiar with a fully
    managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS), Kubernetes can seem complex. Learn the differences
    and tradeoffs.
  :blog_lead: Kubernetes® is dominating in 2018. If you're not already thinking about
    Kubernetes or at least containerization, then you're behind. Fortunately, containers
    and cloud native architectures have never been more accessible or easier to get
    started with. From infrastructure providers like AWS and Azure offering their
    own [versions of managed Kubernetes](https://sysdig.com/blog/ecs-fargate-eks-kubernetes-aws-compared/),
    to organizations like Cloud Foundry offering [Kubernetes services](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/),
    the world is shifting toward containers.
  :post: "\nIf you're working inside of a regulated industry, like healthcare or finance,
    these tools may seem out of reach. The compliance requirements and security restrictions
    of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP, NIST, PCI, and more can seem like impossible hurdles
    to jump when it comes to adopting a platform like Kubernetes.\nThis is exactly
    why [Datica is shifting toward Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    Our customers are asking for it, it’s the future of managing workloads born in
    the cloud, and Datica is already the most robust solution for compliance management
    on the planet. \n\nIf you're new to container orchestration and more familiar
    with a fully managed platform, like Heroku or Datica's legacy product, Kubernetes
    can seem complex. The goal of this article is to compare Kubernetes with a traditional
    PaaS, discuss the differences, and examine the tradeoffs.\n\n> Now that the world
    has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools have become ever
    larger and more complex.\n\n## What is a PaaS?\n\nA Platform as a Service, or
    a PaaS is intended to create a layer of abstraction on top of cloud service providers
    (or in some cases data centers and bare metal) so the end user can focus on deploying,
    managing, and scaling their applications and data. Without going into the [history
    of the PaaS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/) concept,
    it's easy to think about it as a way of automating many of the repetitive, lower-level
    tasks of managing workloads on a server.\n\n## How a PaaS works\n\nThe most well
    known PaaS providers are [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
    and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). These systems work when
    developers make minimal configuration changes to their application's code and
    then simply \"push\" their code to the cloud. The PaaS will then make an attempt
    to understand the code, install the required dependencies, containerize the application,
    and then serve it up. These providers then have a UI layer for managing resources,
    networking, access, and more.\n\n## The benefits of a PaaS\n\nBeing able to directly
    push your code to the cloud and have it running is a tremendous benefit over the
    old days of standing up a server, installing an operating system (and then patching
    it each time there's a vulnerability), getting nginx configured properly, and
    much more. With a PaaS, developers can focus on delivering value via their product,
    not building IT infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being able to simply push your
    code and have it running, many of these PaaS providers also couple database managed
    services as part of their Platform.\n\n## The pitfalls of a PaaS\n\nThe ease of
    use for a PaaS comes at the cost of flexibility. Want to install custom software
    on an instance? Nope. Want to ssh into an instance to investigate an issue that
    isn't appearing in the logs? Nope. Want to do anything beyond a simple Ruby, Python,
    or Node app? Good luck.\n\nA PaaS serves a very specific purpose — to help small
    teams with simple applications run those in the cloud without the DevOps overhead
    of managing a fleet of instances on AWS or Azure.\n\nThe primary reason why so
    many PaaS providers have failed to make substantial headway in the enterprise
    space is because the model is so restrictive. For an organization managing hundreds
    of applications with petabytes of data, it makes more sense to build out a team
    that can manage all of it instead of making substantial changes to your business
    in order to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\n## Enter Kubernetes and containers\n\nNow
    that the world has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools
    have become ever larger and more complex. A small organization that just three
    years ago could have survived on Heroku is now growing at a pace that prohibits
    them from continuing to use a restrictive PaaS. Maybe they're exploring machine
    learning or want a data warehouse. Whatever the case, they've outgrown the PaaS
    model. Now they need to move to something more flexible: Kubernetes.\n\nSince
    the invention of containers, and specifically with the popularity of Docker, organizations
    have been figuring out easier ways to orchestrate containers — that is, how to
    get them running, connected and served up in the cloud. In a way, orchestration
    is the primary function of a PaaS. Because containers are relatively trivial to
    build (and in most cases the build process can be automated, ex: [Gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/))
    the focus in the container space has been on orchestration.\n\n## The benefits
    of containers\n\nThe benefits of containers over virtual machines has been discussed
    to no end on the internet. I won't go into detail here, but simply put — with
    containers, developers can port their applications from machine to machine whether
    that's running it locally on a Mac, on a server in AWS or on a droplet on Digital
    Ocean. A container is a container and it can run anywhere. Compare this to the
    complexity of managing an entire fleet  VM, each with its own OS. With containers
    there’s only one operating system to manage, even with hundreds of containers.\n\n##
    Why Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes and containers have many of the same benefits. They
    can both run anywhere and they both function the same whether they're running
    on AWS, Azure, GCP, or in the locked closet down the hall. Kubernetes is open
    source, financially backed by hundreds of organizations, and is managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). In addition to being
    cross-cloud compatible and open source, Kubernetes has also shown tremendous growth
    in the last year.\n\nIf you’re coming from a PaaS you’ll no doubt have concerns
    around the ease of use and lack of automated DevOps support in Kubernetes. When
    I first explored Kubernetes in late 2014 I walked away feeling like it was too
    complicated and didn’t fit Datica’s customer use case. In 2018 it’s a different
    story.\n\nSince Kubernetes officially hit 1.0 in 2015, the community and project
    have grown at a tremendous pace. What really makes Kubernetes a viable option
    is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround
    it. Kubernetes isn’t a PaaS, it’s a foundation on which to build a PaaS.\n\nThink
    of Kubernetes and the cloud native community as a set of building blocks. With
    these building blocks you can construct any number of different solutions. No
    longer are you held back or restricted by PaaS providers. \n\n## Which to choose\n\nThe
    decision to choose Kubernetes over a PaaS (or vice versa) is going to depend on
    your business, technology, market, team, and several other factors. Having said
    that, even if you currently have a simple application with a relatively smaller
    user base, you’re likely going to scale and change rapidly. Preparing for the
    future by moving to containers now is going to save you time and money when it
    becomes critical later on.\n"

    by becoming a silver member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
  :blog_lead: As any of the 200+ people who have already forked Datica’s open source
    compliance policies can attest, we’ve always been a big believer in the value
    and spirit of open source. Last year our open source commitment evolved to include
    [Open Source Connectors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)
    to help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. Most recently, the open
    source project [Kubernetes&reg;](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/)
    became the fundamental technical management layer for Datica. To take this commitment
    even further, we’re thrilled to announce we’ve become one of the newest silver
    members of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF),
    home of Kubernetes.
  :post: "  \nSince 2015, Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container
    management, lending the best tools for workload deployment on public clouds. In

  :summary: 'Transparency is the heart of Datica. With that said, we announced Datica’s
    public product strategy & roadmap. This document will serve as the window into
    Platform product development. '
  :blog_lead: "Working with any organization requires a certain level of trust. Even
    something as mundane as purchasing groceries requires trust — trust in that what
    you are promising to give me is in fact aligned with my expectations.\n\n"
  :post: "\nWe believe trust is earned with transparency. Since the founding of the
    company in 2013, transparency has been a central cultural tenant. It’s why we
    [open sourced our internal company policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/),
    which have been adopted by hundreds of organizations to accelerate their path
    to compliance on the cloud — it's been 3 years and includes hundreds of HL7 integrations
    as [Mirth transforms](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms) — and
    why we draft as much content as we do around complicated topics like [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/),
    [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/), [GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/),
    and so on. Transparency is how we, as a technology community, can better understand
    the complexity of security and compliance.\n\nThe trust that Datica's customers
    instill in us goes far beyond a simple exchange of goods. We are not only securing
    the world's most sensitive data, but providing a service to users that proves,
    beyond a reasonable doubt, that we maintain the highest level of compliance in
    doing so. In order to continue building on that trust, and delivering products
    and services that support that mission, there is a necessity for more transparency.
    In this first effort to provide increased transparency around what we are doing
    and why, we are publishing our first public product strategy and roadmap.\n\n##
    Why?\n\nIf you’re a Datica customer, or you’re considering becoming one, you will
    rely on us to provide a product that is critical in running your business. Here
    is what you can expect.\n\n### Developer operations\n\nThe Platform is a fully
    automated continuous compliance management tool for the cloud. The cloud, and
    the shared responsibility inherit within, fundamentally change the compliance
    and data liability landscape. Regardless of the support, management, or compliance
    structure your organization chooses to use, at various levels, you will rely on
    Datica to provide cloud security and compliance services. Our goal is to get compliance
    out of the way so you can focus on using the cloud tools you want to use.\n\n###
    Visibility into liability and privacy agreements\n\nThe cloud is opaque when it
    comes to liability and data privacy. At Datica, we strive to bring transparency
    to your cloud operations and your data liability radius. This is especially important
    in the case of a data breach, security incident, or audit.\n\n### Compliance and
    security\n\nAbove all the rest is compliance and security. Our customers rely
    on us to provide the highest level of compliance with our HITRUST CSF certification,
    SOC2 Type 1 and 2, and full GDPR audit (more coming soon). Additionally, they’re
    trusting us to secure their cloud environments and ensure data protection at all
    costs.\n\nGiven how much our customers rely on us to do, they need to be a part
    of the conversation. They need to have full transparency of what we are building.
    That is not to say we’ve been developing the Platform in a vacuum. We work one-on-one
    with users on a daily basis. We’re constantly taking feedback and building that
    back into the product. However, we’ve not always been as transparent as we could
    have been when it comes to the current set of product initiatives. We’re hoping
    to change that with the public product strategy and roadmap (ex: “Hey, I see you're
    working on an update to your vulnerability scanning component, feature X would
    be really nice...”, etc.). Our goal is to give the market a full view of what
    we’re doing and why we’re doing it. \n\nCloud technology and the companies running
    the underlying infrastructure are moving at an incredible speed. By making our
    roadmap and strategy transparent, our hope is to gauge ourselves against this
    speed and adapt accordingly. Datica is a compliance and security company. The
    mechanisms by which we deliver those two value propositions will and should change
    with time.\n\n> Datica’s mission is to empower organizations around the world
    to take their preferred tools, use them in a cloud setting, and then provide and
    maintain the highest standards of security and compliance around those tools.
    \n\n## The Risk\n\nOften when companies are first starting out they view their
    value as a secret. What they’re doing and how they’re doing it is seen as magic
    sauce. They want to harbor that magic. As companies grow and mature, they tend
    to learn that the magic is in execution, not the intellectual property or ideas.
    At Datica, we’ve assembled the best team of security, cloud, and compliance experts
    to execute on designing and delivering the most secure and compliant Platform
    for the cloud. We have no secrets to keep.\n\nWith that said, I’m proud to announce
    [Datica’s public product strategy & roadmap](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-kubernetes-service/roadmap/).
    This document will serve as the window into Platform product development. To get
    the most out of this effort, we need to hear from you. Please send us your feedback,
    feature requests, and ideas to [product@datica.com](mailto:product@datica.com)."

  :blog_lead: 'Datica''s compliance roots start in healthcare with HIPAA, a regulatory

    ## Best practices are best practices

    Compliance is global, however, with highly regulated industries spanning many geographies. The requirements to meet [GDPR regulations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/) by May 25th pushed us to examine a compliance posture that was international instead of HIPAA specific.

    The nearly year-long exercise was a catalyst for our compliance team to innovate on how we could be bigger than just GDPR. We took a look at compliance holistically, and globally, to come up with a strategy that will allow us to better serve customers across industries and geographies.

    The result is simplified with a phrase we use internally: _Best Practices are Best Practices_.

    ## The Datica global compliance roadmap

    Datica's ability to serve international compliance regimes stems from a philosophy exemplified by [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/): one framework, many regimes. We decided to take a single compliance framework, make it our root attestation, and then plan to use it as a repeatable mapping process towards other regimes. HITRUST and its Common Security Framework was clearly the answer.

    HITRUST has done a great job of aiming for big goals. With version 9.1 of the CSF, we believe there are few better options for the most stringent and comprehensive compliance auditing framework on the cloud. The HITRUST CSF is our DNA framework.

    By using HITRUST, we will crosswalk the CSF to other geographies and compliance regimes, thus accelerating our ability to support compliance attestations in those areas. Certainly unique considerations will exist in respective geographies before we can officially support compliant deployments of the Datica Platform in a country, but the CSF will get us almost all the way there in all cases.

    As has been the drumbeat since [Datica's founding in 2013](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/), transparency is the key to distilling the complexity of compliance. Transparency is how we best help healthcare — and other regulated industries — move forward. To communicate our global compliance posture to both present and future customers, we built a handy table that documents our compliance roadmap.

    <img class="lozad group" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=600" data-srcset="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=800 1000w, //images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png 1200w" alt="global compliance stance table" />

    The table is simple:

    * We list geographies and certain regimes that matter in those geographies.
    * One column states if that regime is currently supported by the platform.
    * Another column states if we have plans to support it someday.
    * And lastly, for those we plan to support, we give a broad estimation to when the HITRUST crosswalk will be done along with any additional specific requirements for the respective regime.

    This table will be updated a lot throughout 2018 as we test our compliance posture against new regimes.

    We invite you to take a look at public global compliance roadmap by visiting the [Global Compliance Posture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/cloud-compliance/global/) page of our website.

    In short, we plan to take HITRUST global to both geographies and regimes that we haven't previously supported. We want to be the best compliance management option for cloud native applications across the world.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
