  Crossover is a fantastic company with a smart idea. Patient care is critical to the nation's health, but is evolving at ever-accelerating rates due to technology innovations. Crossover has found a smart way to bring premium patient care to prominent companies, thus not only seeking to make lives healthier, but to play a role in helping those companies grow. No doubt their services are helping those companies achieve even greater success by exposing their employees to on-site clinics, thus saving time.

  We're big fans of Crossover. Great job!
