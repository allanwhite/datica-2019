  At Health 2.0 2017, a panel of leaders who have worked in the trenches discussed the most important
  factors for the success of digital health products.
:blog_lead: 'Recent news tells us that digital health startups drew record investments
  in the first half of 2017. Sadly, according to research by Accenture, more than
  half of those digital health startups are likely to fail within two years following
  launch. How do digital health teams launch products that succeed?

'
:post: "At Health 2.0 2017, a panel of leaders who have worked in the trenches discussed
  the most important\nobservations relating to the success of digital health products.
  The panel was led by Datica CEO Travis Good, who recently published the first [Digital
  Health Success Framework (DHSF)](https://datica.com/dhsf/) — a road map that lays
  out the key considerations along a linear timeline, like compliance and interoperability
  strategies, for teams at startups or large enterprises who want to go from an idea
  to market adoption without making missteps along the way. Good was joined by:\n\n<div

  Panel Recap Highlights \n\n### Q1. Does the business model of a digital health product
  factor as the biggest reason of later failure or success?\n\n**Carolyn Jasik:**
  \"You actually have to be selling something that people want to buy. This seems
  so obvious but so many companies miss this. Digital health vendors need to understand
  how health systems get paid.\"\n\n**Kristi Ebong:** \"It’s also all about the team.
  Can they engage across the health system to identify the complexities to really
  understand the business model? Team is the most opportunity.\"\n\n### Q2. How can
  health systems or payers help digital health succeed? Follow up: which stakeholders
  need early engagement and for what needs?\n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:** \"Having
  someone on the inside of the health system to help navigate the complexity is very
  important to success.\"\n\n**Kristi Ebong:** \"In general, the cosponsors are legal
  and technology. Having that combined insight is critical to knowing which stakeholders
  need to come to the engagement. You must have legal buy-in to help drive commercialization
  focus, plus technology buy-in to know how it will integrate.\"\n\n**Christiana DellaRusso:**
  \"You’ve seen one health system, you’ve seen one health system. There may be patterns,
  but legal, infrastructure, culture are all different for every organization.\" \n\n**Carolyn
  Jasik:** \"A lot of digital health companies don’t recruit people with hospital
  experience. Each health system will tell you that they need a product to be customized
  to them. You need a smart team on the digital health side of things to really know
  what’s scalable. Digital health vendors need the maturity to push back and say 'no,
  we’re going to do it this way.'\"\n\n### Q3. How important are pilots to the success
  of a digital health product? Follow up: What are the common misunderstandings about
  pilots?\n \n**Carolyn Jasik:** \"You first have to know what the goal of the pilot
  is; is it a feasibility pilot or a business opportunity pilot? There are different
  sets of people to work with for each kind, so first know what you’re doing.\"\n\n**Christiana
  DelloRusso:** \"Understand what’s going to be required for scale. Where are the
  resources and budget going to come from and who are the stakeholders and owners
  of the budget? Get as much of that figured out upfront—before the pilot—to get a
  good assessment of success.\"\n\n\n### Q4. Which digital health success stories
  can you share that might provide insight into the differentiators that enable that
  success? \n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:** \"The companies that are doing well are
  the ones that are solving a basic need for health systems. [InDemand Interpreting](https://www.indemandinterpreting.com/)
  is a great example. Their on demand, remote video a-la-cart service is solving a
  solid need that won’t change over time and they are growing solidly.\" \n\n**Kristi
  Ebong:** \"[Well's messaging application](https://wellapp.com/) was in our first
  accelerator program. They have now scaled to 80+ clinics. They solved the pain point
  of physicians not wanting to talk to or message patients directly — it’s not that
  they don’t care, but that they are busy.\"\n\n**Carolyn Jasik:** \"[Voalte](https://www.voalte.com/).
  Their team communication system solves an important problem within a hospital. What’s
  innovative about it is that it puts a device in the hand of every caregiver and
  gives them the ability to message on the spot.\"\n\n**Christiana DelloRusso:** \"In
  thinking about disrupting healthcare, one thing that helps people get perspective
  is to understand that change is relentlessly iterative. You need to understand where
  they need to go, but look at where health systems are right now. The latest and
  greatest disruption is not likely to be feasible for most hospitals... It all comes
  down to understanding that healthcare doesn’t get paid to do the right thing.\""

  :summary: Where do the many predictions and technologies from Health 2.0, 2012 stand
    today? Which products were a hit? What predictions came to be true—or didn't?
  :blog_lead: "As we get our booth shipped and bags packed for Health 2.0 this year,
    I started thinking about when I first attended Health 2.0 five years ago. It was
    held at the Hilton in Union Square in San Francisco. I was in town for my startup's
    interview at Rock Health, which at the time was just a stroll down Geary and a
    left on Grant through the [Dragon Gate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Dragon_Gate_to_Chinatown.jpg)
    to the Rock Health offices in Chinatown. It was my first day ever in San Francisco;
    a place I would soon call home as I spent a chunk of 2012-2013 in the city for
    Rock Health. \n"
  :post: "I was a digital health neophyte at the time, which is to say I worked for
    companies that were much more Health 1.0 before that: Epic, Medseek, (stylized
    very Health 1.0ish as MEDSEEK) and Nordic. I was amazed to enter a room where
    digital health could be the future and where any innovation was possible. Crowdfunding,
    changes to incentives through the ACA, and the ubiquity of cell phones dominated
    conversations about the possibilities of wireless healthcare. Predictions abounded
    about who — told in Bay Area lingo — was going to be the Uber for healthcare.
    For someone who started his career in an era when doctors believed paper was the
    past, present, and future, it was invigorating to meet non-Epic employees who
    actually believed in a digital future for healthcare. \n\nTimes have changed.
    So has Health 2.0. Five years in startup time might as well feel like fifty. As
    a point of reference, you were likely a hipster making fun of Facebook's acquisition
    of Instagram in 2012 when I first attended the conference. While I was prepping
    for this year's Health 2.0 I stumbled across the [legacy website for Health 2.0
    in 2012](http://legacy.health2con.com/events/conferences/san-francisco-fall-2012/#venue).
    I wondered where the many topics, predictions, and technologies from 2012 stood
    today. Which ideas were a hit? What predictions came to be true and what technologies
    faded into the [\"Our Incredible Journey\"](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/)
    tumblr. Here's an overview of the future as seen from 2012, now delivered in 2017.
    \n\n## Wearables and the Quantified Self\n\n**Then:** Wearables couldn't have
    been any bigger in 2012. Even though the Fitbit was, at the time, a [clip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fitbit_products#Fitbit_Zip),
    the possibilities of what could be done by tracking health information using now
    ubiquitous technologies like Bluetooth and Smartphones were endless. There were
    many sessions showing the potential of remote monitoring and smartphones, like
    \"Demos in Context: A Live Environment Exploring Personal Trackers\" (featuring
    now Propeller Health COO Chris Hogg) and \"Off the Couch and Into Shape: Tools
    for Physical Fitness\" (featuring Under Armour before buying MyFitnessPal and
    MapMyFitness).\n\n**Now:** The good news is that every modern iPhone has a pedometer
    in it and that Apple Watch sales are up 50% in 2017. The bad news is that everyone
    else didn't do so hot. Pebble is gone. Jawbone is gone. Fitbit is at 1/50th of
    its value from when it IPO'd in 2015. Did we get some good clinical research from
    the wearables? Actually, [yes](https://www.wired.com/story/bored-with-your-fitbit-these-cancer-researchers-arent/).
    Are we healthier as a whole? Hard to say. The good news is you're probably tracked
    everywhere now; the bad news is the wearables movement didn't necessarily materialize
    into one great set of outcomes or businesses. While startups that focused on deliver
    programs alongside wearables, like Omada Health and Propeller, have kept growing,
    other startups didn't necessarily make the leap. There's still hope for some of
    the 2012 darlings, as exemplified by Jawbone who fail-pivoted into building a
    \"Health Hub\" to compete in the more regulated health tech space.\n\n## Non-invasive
    Diagnosis and Diagnostics\n\n**Then:** There was a session on non-invasive diagnoses
    techniques, which had panelists from CellScope, Glooko (fresh off of a Series-A
    round of funding), Tawkon (tracking radiation exposure via cell phones), Transfuse
    Solutions, and First Derm. Ideas based on painful lab draws and general confusion
    around biometrics and results were beginning to gain traction at this time. \n\n**Now:**
    How did Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos not get an invite to this session? Not
    kidding. It feels like they should have been rubbing shoulders with the Bay Area
    darlings and \"innovators\" in the non-invasive blood draw space before Holmes
    began her Icarian rise into fame. Turns out there is an answer to the question,
    per the man himself. Health 2.0 founder Matthew Holt—Theranos [either ignored
    or eventually declined attendance at all events](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/10/16/five-takeaways-about-the-theranos-broo-ha-ha/).\n\n##
    Value-Based Care\n\n**Then:** While there were a few talks involving population
    health, the agenda for Health 2.0 mentions value-based care exactly zero times.
    There was one main stage session around ACOs and innovations in payment models.
    Conversation centered more around general cost reduction and consumer empowerment.
    Even the Twitter Health Team was getting in on the action, presenting how Twitter
    conceptualized its product being used to empower consumers in the post-ACA era.
    \n\n**Now:** Everyone's favorite digital health buzzword next to \"Big Data\"
    gets a variety of sessions and focus, though less so than [maybe last year](https://datica.com/blog/health-2.0-recap-day-3/)
    due to uncertainty driven by the government vis-a-vis the potential repeal of
    the ACA. \n\n## Blockchain\n\n**Then:** Bitcoin was hovering around $11.00-$12.00
    a bitcoin. \n\n**Now:** The blockchain is the solution to all of our problems
    in health tech, not withstanding:\n\n1. Difficulties in patient matching \n2.
    The patient stigma/business cases of sharing data \n3. Challenges in semantic
    interoperability \n4. Any clinician's willingness to take liability for receiving
    more data before treating a patient\n\n## Startups\n\n**Then:** *Launch!* was
    the premier event at which to launch a digital health startup. The startups, their
    fields, and whether or not they are still seemingly in business were:\n\n- **TicTrac:**
    Personalizable health and wellness platform.\n- **LifeVest Health *(now Life.io)*:**
    Insurance company technology platform.\n- **meQuilibrium:** Digital resilience
    coaching platform\n- **Unfrazzled:** Seemingly shut down. App for unpaid caregivers.\n-
    **First Stop Health:** Telemedicine for employers.\n- **EveryMove:** Wellness
    Platform\n- **Share the Visit:** Seemingly shut down. Telemedicine, but for family
    members and caregivers for other patient visits.\n- **ShareMD:** Pivoted to Datica
    :). [\"Pinterest for Doctors\"](http://legacy.health2con.com/tv/speaker/travis-good/)\n\n**Now:**
    \ There are now 12 startups pitching this year. Kind of amazing to see how many
    of the startups from *Launch!* 2012 survived and thrived given the vast changes
    in health tech and healthcare over the last five years. As for ShareMD, [Travis
    Good and Mohan Balachandran](https://datica.com/leadership/) realized how hard
    it was to get their platform for residents into the hands of clinicians due to
    the arduous and varying requirements imposed on their cloud platforms by academic
    medical centers. Realizing they weren't the only vendors with this problem, Datica’s
    founders saw the real product wasn't the social network but, rather, the platform
    that would make it easier for vendors and organizations to prove and ascertain
    application compliance. And, as such, Datica (née Catalyze) was born. \n\nI hope
    you enjoyed this walk down memory lane. If you enjoyed this blog post, come see
    us at any or all the events we'll be participating in at Health 2.0: \n\n- Come
    learn about the lessons Datica has learned over the last five years and compare
    them to other experiences veterans are seeing in the field at our [Lunch and Learn

  :summary: The challenge for today's hospital CIOs is choosing vendors and technologies
    that integrate with the EMR as well as numerous other hospital systems. That's
    why integration is such a hot topic in healthcare, and is something we take very
    seriously at Voalte.
  :blog_lead: 'Healthcare technology has always been a complex business, and it''s
    not getting any simpler. In the 1960s, mainframes were the behemoth systems that
    stored data, mostly related to a hospital''s accounting functions. In the ''80s
    and ''90s, health IT turned to desktop computers and networking solutions for
    clinical and operational data. In recent years, federal mandates under the American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act caused the focus to shift to electronic medical
    records (EMRs), bringing numerous advantages for patients, medical practices and
    health systems, such as:'
  :post: "* Fewer errors in personal health records\n* Efficient transfer of patient
    data\n* Enhanced workflows that allow for increased productivity\n* Reduction
    of labor and operational costs\n* Superior e-Prescribing and clinical documentation\n\nWhile
    EMRs are powerful systems that have gone a long way in bringing healthcare organizations
    into the digital age, they cannot do everything. Hospitals need numerous systems
    to take full advantage of their EMRs in ways that benefit caregivers, patients,
    and the hospitals that have invested so many resources.\n\nThe challenge for today's
    hospital CIOs is choosing vendors and technologies that integrate with the EMR
    as well as numerous other hospital systems. That's why integration is such a hot
    topic in healthcare, and is something we take very seriously at Voalte.\n\nThe
    first Voalte integrations were with [Philips Intellispace Event Management][1]
    (previously Emergin) and Connexall, which enabled us to give hospital caregivers
    a single end-point device for communication as well as alarm and alert notifications.
    We have since integrated with technologies from many other companies with the
    goal of giving our customers a complete communication platform that ties together
    multiple solutions seamlessly. \n\nIn other industries, integrations are more
    commonplace than in healthcare. Salesforce, for example, started as an application
    platform but has grown into a platform other companies can build on. (See last
    year's news about the [Box-Salesforce][3] integration, which helps their joint
    customers access files more efficiently and lets developers easily embed Box's
    content-management functions into Salesforce.) Facebook and Twitter are examples
    of consumer solutions that allow others to build on their platforms, using APIs
    in ways not originally intended. (If you followed the [Politiwoops][4] story,
    you know that Twitter pulled the plug on this archive of deleted tweets by politicians,
    before reversing that decision as part of its pledge to foster better relationships).\n\nIn
    the future, we believe the Voalte Platform APIs and SDKs will allow partners and
    customers to create innovative solutions that we cannot even begin to imagine.
    Our partnership with Datica is a cornerstone of our strategy of allowing innovators
    who use Voalte Platform to have easy access to EHR data so they can build amazing
    patient-centric solutions. We are able to do this because Datica lets us focus
    on our job rather than on the administrative, compliance burdens.\n\n----\n\n_Alex
    Brown is Director of Strategy at Voalte, where he leads the Product and Partnership
    teams. Over the past five years, he has managed partnerships with leading EMR,
    device and integration vendors._\n\n\n[1]: http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/product/HC866030/intellispace-event-management-information-system\n[3]:

  :blog_lead: This second interview of our “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape”
    series, highlights the digital health innovation of Strata Health within the United
    States, and beyond. Operational in North America, the UK, France, and Australia,
    Strata Health is a privately held Canadian corporation of professionals with empathy
    for those who need care and intense respect for those who devote themselves to
    caring for others.
  :post: "_[Peter Smith](https://stratahealth.com/about-us/executive-team/), Executive
    Vice President Canada for Strata Health, shares his insights into digital health
    innovation across the globe. Working with healthcare practitioners, clinicians,
    IT specialists and administrators, [Strata Health](https://stratahealth.com/)
    pioneered the development of powerful software tools that have revolutionized
    patient flow, benefiting patients, caregivers and system efficiencies alike. Their
    proprietary intelligent referral technology has positive effects right through
    the care system from better matching of patients to specialists all the way to
    reducing paperwork._ \n\n## Q & A with Peter Smith\n\n### You operate in multiple
    countries with the U.S. being the most recent, whereas the typical digital health
    product is U.S.-centric. Do you see a big difference between the application or
    the success of digital health in the U.S. versus the rest of the world?\n\nBroadly
    speaking the application of digital health in the U.S. is more advanced than the
    rest of the world. This is due to the level of investment, the size of the population,
    and the amount of profit in the U.S. health market. There are also many other
    countries and innovation hotspots in the world but the U.S. generally attracts
    the most investment into digital health. But when you look at specific areas of
    digital health you can find examples where the U.S. lags behind the rest of the
    modern world. For example, using digital health tools and technology to improve
    the overall efficiency and cost of the health system is not that prevalent yet
    in the U.S. market. This is, at least in part, due to the fact that the U.S. market
    is for-profit private healthcare, which can create different incentives than you
    see in countries where the healthcare system is public. In countries with government
    paid (public) healthcare, those government bodies are driven to make the entire
    healthcare system as efficient as possible.\n\n### What's the biggest challenge
    holding back digital health innovation within the U.S. market?\n\nThere are many
    silos within the U.S. health market, and these silos most often operate as for-profit
    enterprises. This means each of these silos is looking to innovate when it makes
    economic sense for that silo, but not necessarily economic sense for the system,
    and not necessarily better care for the patient.\n\nThe U.S. is learning from
    the public health systems in the world. Examples are the creation of Accountable
    Care Organizations (which make providers jointly accountable for the health of
    their patients), and the concept of episode-based bundled payments (where providers
    are paid a fixed fee for a particular diagnosis or procedure, but no more if complications
    arise). The U.S. needs to review the interactions a patient makes with the various
    parts of the U.S. health system during a episodic journey, and then evaluate if
    the system is creating the right incentives for providers to perform in the best
    interest of the system and the patient, while still being a private enterprise.\n\n###
    Do you find the interest in digital health from C-suites to be the same in all
    the countries you operate in? Or different?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes there is
    equal interest in digital health from C-suites in Canada, U.S., U.K., Scotland,
    France, and Australia.\n\n### What’s Strata's greatest success story?\n\nThe health
    and social care teams across Cumbria are set to further roll out their Strata
    Health air traffic control system to manage patient transitions across the whole
    of the region. NHS Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust, University Hospitals
    of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, and Cumbria County Council have to date
    automated the process of health and social care referrals across the region, enabling
    transparent and consistent patient transitions supporting the patient journey
    while eradicating paper in the process. \n\n\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.
  :body: "\n## What is the Healthcare Cloud?\nA healthcare cloud is a HIPAA cloud

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
