  ## Datica Cofounder on HITRUST BA Council

  Very excitingly, Travis Good, MD, CEO and chief privacy officer has been selected as a founding member to the [Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) Business Associate Council (BA Council). The BA Council is composed of members who will serve as an advocacy group for the healthcare industry's business associates, specifically focused on the [value of HITRUST][1] in third-party information security assurance. There were only 17 selected to be members of the BA Council from a wide pool of industry leaders and experts in technology, security, risk compliance and audits. The HITRUST Alliance will lean on this council to help shape HITRUST's approach for business associates at a pivotal time in the industry where a growing number of HIPAA-covered entities have announced a requirement that their business associates become HITRUST CSF certified within 24 months.

  Datica has taken a lead in understanding not just HITRUST, but the value of HITRUST for [business associates](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/) in the marketplace. "This appointment validates our leadership and expertise in compliance, and particularly HITRUST, which is such a big trend in the industry," said Dr. Good. "I think that experience and knowledge, as well as the things Datica has done in the industry can contribute significantly to translating the value of HITRUST and its rigorous approach to information security for business associates."

  ## HealthXL Global Gathering Recap

  As was announced in last week's blog post, Casey Bryson, Datica Chief Strategy Officer, attended the exclusive HealthXL Global Gathering in San Francisco where 60 handpicked senior executives from leading, innovative digital health companies gathered to discuss three main topics: sleep, Big Data analytics, and patient/consumer engagement.

  ### Sleep

  The discussion had a primary focus on monitoring sleep patterns through devices and using data to be a driving force for patient behavioral changes, but it is very difficult to convince payers to buy into the value since there is no short term ROI on the immediate investment. [David White][2] from [Philips Healthcare][3] simply, yet insightfully, stated that we just need more data to prove that sleep therapy and monitoring is worth the investment before we can change the behaviors of patients and the way we deliver medicine.

  ### Big Data Analytics

  One of our favorite innovators, [Molly Coye][4], discussed India's emergency response systems and how they use predictive analytics to determine where crashes are going to occur and station responders nearby, not at a home base like in the United States. That ideology has to transition into our healthcare system. Also discussed was, Big Data's role in providing behavioral medicine care. Statistically speaking, for 80% of patients data can drive a care plan and automated care management tools can reach them and insert a provider for validation since patients prefer to be validated by a physician. For the remaining 20%, Big Data can be used to determine how to best treat their conditions to drives better decisions.

  ### Consumer & Patient Engagement

  How do we best engage patients in their care? The question on everyone's minds. It was stated that "the personal touch of healthcare has been lost in fee for service" but Bryson personally believes it's due to the combination of the reimbursement model and the lack of time for a physician to focus on personalized medicine. Stop saying "should" and just do it.

  [Sean Duffy][5], Co-Founder & CEO of [Omada Health][6], gave a great story of making a personalized platform that has been able to scale with extreme success, while [Bruce Ettinger][7], CEO at [Frame Health][8], introduced us to the concept of prescriptive medicine to tailor messaging to the way a patient's needs can be addressed. We look forward to taking all of these learnings and applying them to our own engagement efforts.****

  ## HOSTING Customer Summit in Denver, CO

  Casey Bryson also announced this week a partnership with[ HOSTING][9], the leading provider of managed cloud services at the HOSTING Customer Summit in Denver, Colorado. This partnership will offer 24x7 managed hosting services to the growing and maturing clients of Datica. Datica and HOSTING share a similar customer demographic in the healthcare IT landscape. Consequently, this trusted partnership allows each company to focus on its core competency, leveraging the other for its specific expertise. Check back next week for Bryson's recap at HOSTING.

  > "We are proud to partner with HOSTING and leverage its Unified Cloud approach. Both firms specialize in delivering an amazing user experience, regardless of which clouds a customer chooses to run its application on," said Bryson. "The relationship gives us the ability to work with a single support partner across multiple cloud service providers."

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
