:summary: Integrating with Epic, Cerner, Allscripts and every other EHR is a process
  — from security to management — that's tricky, time consuming, and expensive.
:blog_lead: 'We are often asked about integrating with Epic, Cerner, Allscripts and
  every other EHR big or small. The people asking us for help range from digital health
  rookies to industry leaders. The process of setting up an integration, from security
  to management, can be tricky, time consuming and expensive.

:post: |
  Since we launched our EHR Integrations product we learned plenty of lessons about running an integration project on-time and on-budget. Even with years of guiding hospitals through Epic installs and being a former digital health startup founder myself, there were nuances to connecting the intersection of those two worlds that took some time to learn. Out goal is to make those nuances less foreign and more approachable so that _anyone_ can set up an integration without being afraid of the consequences.

  We recently added a new entry to our [Academy](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/) library where we discuss the process of integrating with Epic or any other EHR. It's more of a process and less of a technical exercise than you may think. [Read our overview on how to integrate with Epic.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/how-to-integrate-with-epic-or-any-ehr/)

  Included in the new entry is a link to our 30-day project plan for HL7 installs. Full disclosure: working within the constraints of a healthcare organization might have an impact on your go-live date. Despite this, we've managed to run through this plan even faster in the past. Part of the reason we can move so quickly is that we've automated most of the deployment and have the talent in house to execute on it. I'm proud of the EHR Integrations team we've built so far and I'm looking forward to expanding our team and our platform in 2015.

  :blog_lead: "> Interoperability may not have gotten enough attention in the early
    days of Meaningful Use’s electronic health records (EHR) gold rush, but it’s now
    taking center stage as healthcare providers, government agencies, vendors, and
    committees consider how to support the exchange of data easily and securely. People
    underestimate how challenging this work is. Vendors are being cautious before
    spending lots of research and development money before a standard is more clearly
    defined. - [Alison Diana](http://www.informationweek.com/author-bio.asp?author_id=495),

  :post: "Last month on October 02, 2015 at the KLAS Keystone Summit in Midway, Utah,
    the top EHR vendor and provider executives and stakeholders gathered by consensus
    in an attempt to bring objectivity to the metrics of interoperability. Along with
    collaboration efforts from informatics specialists and provider organizations,
    the following twelve corporations were involved:\n\n1. Allscripts (Assaf Halevy,
    VP of business development, solutions management)\n2. athenahealth (Jonathan Bush,
    CEO)\n3. Cerner (Zane Burke, president)\n4. eClinicalWorks (Girish Kumar, CEO)\n5.

    VP of product)\n12. NextGen Healthcare (Rusty Frantz, president and CEO)\n\nRegardless
    of the $31.5 billion investment from federal funds, it is clear that there are
    still critical gaps in the interoperability endeavors of EHRs. It is because of
    this that these leaders gathered to propose new reports with a basis from their
    own internal IT systems and interoperability efforts. The data that will be included
    has been classified as either “hard” or “soft” data. Hard data may be how these
    systems have achieved interoperability with vendors, whereas soft data could be
    measuring the responsiveness of the vendor. \n\nOnce these reports become finalized,
    they will be presented to the policymakers to show the market’s continued progress
    and further attempts to standardize how healthcare systems communicate. With the
    vision of true interoperability in healthcare on the horizon, the rest of us are
    on the edge of our seats with anticipation to see these finalized metrics as this
    standard becomes more clearly defined. \n\nWhat do you think goes into measuring

  :summary: Value-based care finally provides the incentives for enhanced interoperability,
    but who is going to pay the up front bill to get started? Vendors? Doctors? Healthcare
    organizations? Payers?
  :blog_lead: 'Coming to the end of our analysis of the five major barriers to interoperability
    is a look at the costs involved with this initiative. The [GAO report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672585.pdf)
    took such a comprehensive view into EHR interoperability that one has to wonder
    where the funds are coming from. Seventeen of the eighteen representatives in
    the study were actually from non-profit efforts or part of non-profit organizations
    – so, again, where did the money come from? Well the eighteen initiatives cited
    a variety of sources, including grants, a cornucopia of fees, charitable donations
    and funding from private organizations. If you’re wondering why so many origin
    points, the answer is quite simple – EHRs are expensive. Or, rather, HIT has always
    been expensive and an EHR is simply a bigger target for cost vs. the 30 legacy
    systems which handled what the EHR does now.

'
  :post: |+
    Have doubts? Take a look at this (incomplete) list of cost area considerations:

    - Data center or hosted costs
    - EHR licenses
    - Hardware
    - Internet bandwidth
    - EHR staff facilities
    - EHR maintenance
    - Support fees
    - Supplies, reimbursement
    - Third party software
    - Interfaces
    - Data migration and system conversions
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Policies and procedures
    - New modules or technologies
    - Specialty requirements
    - EHR customizations
    - And the list goes on...

    What has been reported by the [Michigan Center for Effective IT Adoption](https://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/web-site-disclaimers) is that EHR adoption has upfront costs and yearly costs ranging from $15, 000 to $70, 000 per provider. Costs will vary depending on whether on-site or web-based EHR deployment is selected with SaaS typically requiring providers to pay fixed subscription pricing models. The PTSO of Washington says that “every dollar spent on development = $1 spent to maintain over a three year period.” And those dollars really add up, especially when you’re trying to take on the feat of national interoperability.

    For such a feat to be achieved, one necessary cost is EHR customization. Initiative representatives reported that many EHR systems require many customized interfaces, which are specially designed connections to other health IT systems, in order to facilitate interoperability with other providers and organizations. That sentence has a lot of buzzwords in it, so allow me to simplify: it takes a lot of work to make the data gleaned from interoperability useful. These fees are ones the buyers of the EHR systems (i.e., providers) are responsible for. The overall cost to getting this type of work done is not always transparent.

    ### So what does this mean?

    We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Value-based care finally provides the incentives for enhanced interoperability, but who is going to pay the up front bill to get started? Vendors? Doctors? Healthcare organizations? Payers? It's hard to say. We'll find our more on how this will shake out in 2016.

  :summary: 'Mark Olschesky shares what he learned, saw, and enjoyed at the 2nd annual
    HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. Hint: FHIR is fast becoming a reality.'
  :blog_lead: I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at
    the 2nd [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable](http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/roundtable/2017/03/).
    This topped my must-attend 2017 events after I attended the first event last fall
    in Boston. Here's what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.
  :post: "## A Recap of the HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable\n\n### Datica's presentation\nI
    presented a demonstration of Datica, highlighting how vendors and innovation groups
    can use [Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) to build applications
    that aggregate hospital registration and scheduling feeds along with vitals and
    results from multiple organizations. They can then build the longitudinal patient
    records in an easy to query method. Of course, the underlying data storage format
    and query mechanisms are those provided by FHIR. It's an effective catalyst for
    companies building a new product that relies on data integration, especially from
    disparate sources. If you need to facilitate faster application development for
    you or your team, let us know and we’ll schedule a demo.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/MpnXJGu24MqkQo88WOWMu/f737b76a63cf82ad05e296baaa631752/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo.jpg)\n
    \n### More live demos\nWhile the last FHIR Applications Roundtable featured many
    \"conceptual\" demonstrations of applications, during this second roundtable we
    saw more applications directly embedded into EHRs; presenters demonstrated their
    apps within the Cerner and Epic EHRs. After this year’s presentations, I can say
    with even more certainty that FHIR is for real.\n \n### Real-life use cases for
    PHRs and patient-initiated interoperability\nPersonal Health Records (PHRs) have
    existed for years, but often lacked true utility due to their inability to integrate
    directly with EHRs and their associated patient portals. As such, most PHRs operated
    via manual patient entry of their data into the PHR software. This had changed.
    Multiple demos showed how PHRs could use SMART on FHIR to access data from multiple
    EHRs and patient portals, all with permissions and scope set by the patient. Live
    demos highlighted this functionality, including one given by Michele Mottini from
    CareEvolution showing access of data from Cedars-Sinai My CS-Link (powered by
    Epic's MyChart). As someone who operates primarily on the B2B side of interoperability
    but yearned for real solutions around patient-initiated interoperability, seeing
    that patients will have the ability to aggregate data from multiple portals and
    hospitals soon is exciting. A hat tip to Epic and Cerner for making this happen.\n
    \n### Need for API management\nA few vendors provided presentations on how access
    controls could be layered on top of FHIR for more pragmatic management of FHIR
    resources. It seems like [EMR vendors are remaining hands-off](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    in this space, leading other vendors to rush in to fill the gap in API management
    (including Datica!).\n \n### People from all sides of the healthcare technology
    spectrum\nThe ability to talk to employees from startups, publicly-traded companies,
    hospitals and payers, life sciences and pharma all in the same place is amazing
    at the Apps Roundtable. Once again, [people are investing time and resources in
    FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/). A data standard is only
    as good as its utility and more and more companies are pledging to utilize it.
    As someone who wants to see interoperability improved through pragmatic standards-based
    integration, this provides hope that we'll get there.\n\n### Duke is lovely\nAfter
    things wrapped up on Wednesday, I meandered around the Medical School. Taking
    a short walk from the hospital towards the Duke Chapel and Gardens on a nice sunny
    day provided a peaceful environment only steps from the hospital.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/32c1t5oUPSUSScGW0UM2gi/175e508b0ac48fb5a8492063b591199b/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior.jpg)\n\nDatica
    is a proud member of the [HL7 organization](http://www.hl7.org/). Basing our integration
    and data management approaches around standards like FHIR gives our customers
    the best chance at being future-proof vs. proprietary data formats built by other
    vendors. These HL7 events gives us a first-hand look at what others are working
    on and how we can help make that happen with Datica Compliant Cloud.\n\n*Get the

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
