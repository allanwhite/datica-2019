    The Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) is a simple guide for the makers of digital healthcare products.

    The Internet is full of resources to help turn ideas into lean startups or businesses, but things are a little different in the wild wild west of digital health technology. There are considerations in healthcare not found in any other industry, and no one has time to learn them all.

    We’ve simplified the unique complexities to help you get your digital health products from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises. You will leave with a better understanding of how to manage the challenges ahead.

:summary: The latest addition to the DHSF is meant to help you gain a better understanding
  of the evidence needed for your digital health strategy.
:blog_lead: "There’s so much for makers of digital health products to plan for as
  part of their digital health strategy. At Datica, one of the main things we do is
  to strive to simplify the complex world of digital health, making it easier for
  developers of new products to succeed. It is this goal that drove us to produce
  the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/) — a living document
  that provides a guide through the journey of developing a HIPAA compliant application
  for healthcare. \n\nBy saying this is a live document, what I mean is that we are
  continually adding to it and improving it to increase its relevancy. Our latest
  addition to the DHSF is a new section meant to help you gain a better understanding
  of the evidence needed as part of your digital health strategy."
:post: |-
  This new chapter of the Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) will take you through the steps needed to prove your application works — from your first month in business all the way to the twenty-second. Here's what you'll learn, month-by-month in the [Evidence](/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea) section.

  <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea" title="DSHF Evidence: Validating the idea" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 1</a></div>

  ### Validating the idea

  There are a lot of things broken in healthcare and few areas where you can say that care is optimized for patients, let alone providers. The challenge is that there are some strong industry debts, or ingrained impediments, that make some improvements in care unrealistic, especially on aggressive timelines.

  Because of this, the first step in a digital health evidence strategy is to engage with an expert, typically a care provider, champion, or administrator. The outcome of this engagement should be either 1) feedback to adjust the idea and assumptions underlying the digital health product or 2) an expert opinion, ideally in the form of a quote that can be used publicly, in support of the digital health product.

  <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-develop-evidence-roadmap" title="DSHF Evidence: Develop an evidence roadmap" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 3</a></div>

  ### Develop an evidence roadmap

  Not all digital health product categories are created equal when it comes to evidence. The important thing to understand at this stage is how the different kinds of evidence apply to your product. If your product is integrated into care, like a digital therapeutic or a care management platform, then moving towards peer-reviewed evidence in support of the way your product improves outcomes, is necessary. If your product helps to fill empty slots in schedules, you likely won’t ever need to worry about peer-reviewed evidence but you will need to build a body of evidence from real customer data to support your claims of spots filled or recovering of lost revenue.

  It’s at this point that you want to roughly map out your evidence roadmap, which is simply a timeline of when you expect, or hope, to have different levels of evidence. Like a product roadmap, it’s going to be goal-oriented in that you need to back into timelines based on your goal delivery dates for different kinds of evidence.

  <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-create-evidence-collateral" title="DSHF Evidence: Create collateral on evidence for  your product" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 6</a></div>

  ### Create collateral on evidence for  your product

  It would be nice to have a NEJM or JAMA article in support of your product but that’s highly unlikely at this stage of your journey. The goal at this stage is to empower your customer-facing teams with clear and concise collateral containing data about the benefits of your product from real-world applications.

  One additional thing to consider at this stage is customizing evidence collateral for your intended audiences. Maybe you only have one buyer but it’s likely there are other people involved in the buying process, especially if you’re selling to enterprises. Think about ways you can tailor the data, maybe even just the data you highlight, for different audiences.

  <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-applying-healthcare-economics" title="DSHF Evidence: Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 12</a></div>

  ### Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution

  Healthcare economics is focused, at a high level, on the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare — everything from prevention and delivery to collections. [Wikipedia has a good primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics), though you could get a Ph.D. in healthcare economics because it’s that big of a subject.

  The thing that’s hard about healthcare economics is that what seems like a perfectly logical reason to implement a digital health solution, namely because it would result in better care, less expensive overall costs, and clear ROI, doesn’t always make sense.

  You’ll need to understand where and how economic benefits are realized. Many digital health solutions, especially those that target improving outcomes, benefit payors and not health care delivery organizations. This is changing with models that pay for value and not volume, things like readmission penalties and ACOs, but healthcare today largely still operates on volume and not value.

  <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-add-credibility-to-evidence" title="DSHF Evidence: Add credibility and weight to your evidence" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 22</a></div>

  ### Add credibility and weight to your evidence

  By this time, you should have traction and will be looking to add new customers and implementations for your digital health product. At this stage, you should be thinking about how to expand the collateral you have already created by adding credibility.

  The best way is getting something published on your evidence. This doesn’t have to be in a peer-reviewed clinical journal but could be an online publication. Think of health management publications like Health Affairs. Or, it could simply be joint collateral with one of your customers.

  :blog_lead: |-
    When we launched the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf) (DHSF) this summer, the immediate reaction from the health IT community, and from digital health teams specifically, was immensely positive. It was like getting a high 5 from a stranger every day.

    Since launch, we learned its greatest strength is also its greatest current weakness. Let me explain.

    <p class="text-center text--small">Travis Good, MD on the Digital Health Success Framework</p>

    The ultimate value of the DHSF is that it is not made up. It's genuine in its attempt to distill thousands of past conversations. The data behind the framework is significant.

    Condensing over 3,000 conversations down to a single piece of digestible content has been a challenge. The first stab at presenting the DHSF went over well, as one of the most positive feedback points has been the linear sequential display of insights.

    Still, for those who don't have the time to consider the complete scope of the written content packaged in the framework, getting started wrapping their head around it—and what it means for them—is daunting.

    This is why we are holding our first [webinar](http://content.datica.com/digital-health-success-framework-overview-webinar-sept-25th-2017) in an attempt to explain the DHSF even more simply than we can via a web experience.

    In our upcoming webinar, scheduled for Monday, September 25th, at 12pm CST, Mark Olschesky, Datica Chief Data Officer, will conduct a lunch-time session that summarizes the origins, key insights, and benefits of the Digital Health Success Framework.

    [Register for the event here](http://content.datica.com/digital-health-success-framework-overview-webinar-sept-25th-2017). We look forward to sharing the DHSF with you on September 25th!

  :summary: Where do the many predictions and technologies from Health 2.0, 2012 stand
    today? Which products were a hit? What predictions came to be true—or didn't?
  :blog_lead: "As we get our booth shipped and bags packed for Health 2.0 this year,
    I started thinking about when I first attended Health 2.0 five years ago. It was
    held at the Hilton in Union Square in San Francisco. I was in town for my startup's
    interview at Rock Health, which at the time was just a stroll down Geary and a
    left on Grant through the [Dragon Gate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Dragon_Gate_to_Chinatown.jpg)
    to the Rock Health offices in Chinatown. It was my first day ever in San Francisco;
    a place I would soon call home as I spent a chunk of 2012-2013 in the city for
    Rock Health. \n"
  :post: "I was a digital health neophyte at the time, which is to say I worked for
    companies that were much more Health 1.0 before that: Epic, Medseek, (stylized
    very Health 1.0ish as MEDSEEK) and Nordic. I was amazed to enter a room where
    digital health could be the future and where any innovation was possible. Crowdfunding,
    changes to incentives through the ACA, and the ubiquity of cell phones dominated
    conversations about the possibilities of wireless healthcare. Predictions abounded
    about who — told in Bay Area lingo — was going to be the Uber for healthcare.
    For someone who started his career in an era when doctors believed paper was the
    past, present, and future, it was invigorating to meet non-Epic employees who
    actually believed in a digital future for healthcare. \n\nTimes have changed.
    So has Health 2.0. Five years in startup time might as well feel like fifty. As
    a point of reference, you were likely a hipster making fun of Facebook's acquisition
    of Instagram in 2012 when I first attended the conference. While I was prepping
    for this year's Health 2.0 I stumbled across the [legacy website for Health 2.0
    in 2012](http://legacy.health2con.com/events/conferences/san-francisco-fall-2012/#venue).
    I wondered where the many topics, predictions, and technologies from 2012 stood
    today. Which ideas were a hit? What predictions came to be true and what technologies
    faded into the [\"Our Incredible Journey\"](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/)
    tumblr. Here's an overview of the future as seen from 2012, now delivered in 2017.
    \n\n## Wearables and the Quantified Self\n\n**Then:** Wearables couldn't have
    been any bigger in 2012. Even though the Fitbit was, at the time, a [clip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fitbit_products#Fitbit_Zip),
    the possibilities of what could be done by tracking health information using now
    ubiquitous technologies like Bluetooth and Smartphones were endless. There were
    many sessions showing the potential of remote monitoring and smartphones, like
    \"Demos in Context: A Live Environment Exploring Personal Trackers\" (featuring
    now Propeller Health COO Chris Hogg) and \"Off the Couch and Into Shape: Tools
    for Physical Fitness\" (featuring Under Armour before buying MyFitnessPal and
    MapMyFitness).\n\n**Now:** The good news is that every modern iPhone has a pedometer
    in it and that Apple Watch sales are up 50% in 2017. The bad news is that everyone
    else didn't do so hot. Pebble is gone. Jawbone is gone. Fitbit is at 1/50th of
    its value from when it IPO'd in 2015. Did we get some good clinical research from
    the wearables? Actually, [yes](https://www.wired.com/story/bored-with-your-fitbit-these-cancer-researchers-arent/).
    Are we healthier as a whole? Hard to say. The good news is you're probably tracked
    everywhere now; the bad news is the wearables movement didn't necessarily materialize
    into one great set of outcomes or businesses. While startups that focused on deliver
    programs alongside wearables, like Omada Health and Propeller, have kept growing,
    other startups didn't necessarily make the leap. There's still hope for some of
    the 2012 darlings, as exemplified by Jawbone who fail-pivoted into building a
    \"Health Hub\" to compete in the more regulated health tech space.\n\n## Non-invasive
    Diagnosis and Diagnostics\n\n**Then:** There was a session on non-invasive diagnoses
    techniques, which had panelists from CellScope, Glooko (fresh off of a Series-A
    round of funding), Tawkon (tracking radiation exposure via cell phones), Transfuse
    Solutions, and First Derm. Ideas based on painful lab draws and general confusion
    around biometrics and results were beginning to gain traction at this time. \n\n**Now:**
    How did Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos not get an invite to this session? Not
    kidding. It feels like they should have been rubbing shoulders with the Bay Area
    darlings and \"innovators\" in the non-invasive blood draw space before Holmes
    began her Icarian rise into fame. Turns out there is an answer to the question,
    per the man himself. Health 2.0 founder Matthew Holt—Theranos [either ignored
    or eventually declined attendance at all events](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/10/16/five-takeaways-about-the-theranos-broo-ha-ha/).\n\n##
    Value-Based Care\n\n**Then:** While there were a few talks involving population
    health, the agenda for Health 2.0 mentions value-based care exactly zero times.
    There was one main stage session around ACOs and innovations in payment models.
    Conversation centered more around general cost reduction and consumer empowerment.
    Even the Twitter Health Team was getting in on the action, presenting how Twitter
    conceptualized its product being used to empower consumers in the post-ACA era.
    \n\n**Now:** Everyone's favorite digital health buzzword next to \"Big Data\"
    gets a variety of sessions and focus, though less so than [maybe last year](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/health-2.0-recap-day-3/)
    due to uncertainty driven by the government vis-a-vis the potential repeal of
    the ACA. \n\n## Blockchain\n\n**Then:** Bitcoin was hovering around $11.00-$12.00
    a bitcoin. \n\n**Now:** The blockchain is the solution to all of our problems
    in health tech, not withstanding:\n\n1. Difficulties in patient matching \n2.
    The patient stigma/business cases of sharing data \n3. Challenges in semantic
    interoperability \n4. Any clinician's willingness to take liability for receiving
    more data before treating a patient\n\n## Startups\n\n**Then:** *Launch!* was
    the premier event at which to launch a digital health startup. The startups, their
    fields, and whether or not they are still seemingly in business were:\n\n- **TicTrac:**
    Personalizable health and wellness platform.\n- **LifeVest Health *(now Life.io)*:**
    Insurance company technology platform.\n- **meQuilibrium:** Digital resilience
    coaching platform\n- **Unfrazzled:** Seemingly shut down. App for unpaid caregivers.\n-
    **First Stop Health:** Telemedicine for employers.\n- **EveryMove:** Wellness
    Platform\n- **Share the Visit:** Seemingly shut down. Telemedicine, but for family
    members and caregivers for other patient visits.\n- **ShareMD:** Pivoted to Datica
    :). [\"Pinterest for Doctors\"](http://legacy.health2con.com/tv/speaker/travis-good/)\n\n**Now:**
    \ There are now 12 startups pitching this year. Kind of amazing to see how many
    of the startups from *Launch!* 2012 survived and thrived given the vast changes
    in health tech and healthcare over the last five years. As for ShareMD, [Travis
    Good and Mohan Balachandran](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/) realized how hard
    it was to get their platform for residents into the hands of clinicians due to
    the arduous and varying requirements imposed on their cloud platforms by academic
    medical centers. Realizing they weren't the only vendors with this problem, Datica’s
    founders saw the real product wasn't the social network but, rather, the platform
    that would make it easier for vendors and organizations to prove and ascertain
    application compliance. And, as such, Datica (née Catalyze) was born. \n\nI hope
    you enjoyed this walk down memory lane. If you enjoyed this blog post, come see
    us at any or all the events we'll be participating in at Health 2.0: \n\n- Come
    learn about the lessons Datica has learned over the last five years and compare
    them to other experiences veterans are seeing in the field at our [Lunch and Learn
    panel at 12:30 on Monday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/194628).
    Christiana DelloRusso from Providence Ventures, Carolyn Jasik from Omada Health,
    and Kristi Ebong from Cedars-Sinai Accelerator will be joining Travis for a panel
    discussion about what success in digital health really looks like. \n- Our VP
    of Product Ryan Rich will be demoing on stage how easy it can be to deploy code
    in a compliant environment at [11:20 on Tuesday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/204332).
    \n- And, finally, we'll be at Booth #204 to talk about how we can help you be
    successful in digital health through compliance, security and healthcare data
    integration. Stop by and take our 3-minute assessment based on the [Digital Health
    Success Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/) to find out how far you’ve come in
    your own digital health journey and how far you still have to go.\n"

  :summary: Esther Dyson, whose career includes journalist, author, businesswoman,
    commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and even backup cosmonaut, sat down
    for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD.
  :blog_lead: "This November, the [Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/podcast/)
    interviewed a very special industry guest. Due to audio difficulties, we chose
    to run a transcript of our fascinating conversation. \n\nEsther Dyson has worn
    many different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author,
    businesswoman, commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup
    cosmonaut. Esther sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In
    this interview, she shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital
    health success, the importance of security and privacy for digital health firms,
    and gave us an update on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American
    communities to use different measures to cultivate health and invest in the value
    wellness returns. "
  :post: "> Don't be afraid to try. Work under the assumption that it will work and
    if it doesn't work, figure out why. In a startup you are doing things people have
    never done before.\" - Esther Dyson \n\n## Q & A with Travis Good and Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis
    Good, MD:** _Esther, you’ve said in the past that as an angel investor you like
    to focus your investments on disease prevention versus technology around disease
    treatment. Can you tell us a bit more about that philosophy?_\n\n**Esther Dyson:**
    In general, you get a better return on keeping things working and investing in
    capacity than you do in trying to repair things that are broken. To some extent,
    people sometimes take that for granted. They do general maintenance to their cars
    and they conduct home maintenance, but often forget when it comes to their own
    bodies. People generally don't go to the doctor until they are sick and by that
    time, it is extremely expensive to try and fix the problem. It's expensive not
    just for you, but also for the healthcare system. It’s also expensive for your
    employer and you are probably less productive there. For individual investors
    and for society in general, it makes more sense to keep us healthy. Obviously,
    a big market exists for fixing people who are broken, but given that I have limited
    resources, I'd rather try to put the people who are trying to “fix what is broken”
    out of business by keeping everybody healthy.\n\n> Let’s start with the simple
    proposition that health is an asset. It might be our most important asset. And
    like any asset, if we cultivate it we increase the value it returns. We’re not
    talking about fixes when health is broken; those are important but they happen
    too late.\n— [Way To WellVille](http://www.wellville.net/about-wellville/)\n\n**Travis:**
    _I would agree that obviously prevention is the ideal path so that makes sense
    from an investment standpoint, as well. I want to shift gears to something you
    founded in 2013. You rebranded the Health Initiative Coordinating Council (HICCup)._\n\n<img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"Dyson - WaytoWellville-logo\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/KIxLr1iDGmiyYAi6cS4mG/d2080c6197ba94f2841c853c77015aac/Dyson_-_WaytoWellville-logo.png?w=400\"
    width=\"200\">\n\n**Esther:** In 2013, I founded Way to Wellville, which is a
    nonprofit and it does exactly what we are talking about. The investment pays off
    but the business model doesn't necessarily pay back to the investor, so that's
    why [Way to Wellville](http://hitconsultant.net/2015/02/12/esther-dysons-way-to-wellville-challenge/)
    is a nonprofit. We are trying to show the value of investing in health. Ultimately,
    governments, communities, and employers will realize there's a huge ROI. In 2014,
    we selected five communities from among 42 that applied. Now, the Wellville team
    of five are working with actual communities to help make them healthy. By the
    end of ten years, we hope to have enough success and visibility that we actually
    persuade other people to follow our path.\n\n> These are all real places with
    real people. They are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just
    places that have decided they would like a better future for their residents.
    [Wellville is] helping them build that for themselves.\n\n**Travis:** _My understanding
    is that the goal with these communities is to see which one could most improve
    five measures of health and economic vitality over a five year period. That was
    2014; we are almost in 2018 now. Could you update us on how that's going?_\n\n**Esther:**
    As I mentioned, we pivoted. It did start out as a contest, but it turned out the
    communities were not interested in beating one another, they really wanted to
    collaborate and learn from one another. It also became clear that ten years is
    a more realistic timeframe. Like any startup, we've morphed. It turns out that
    getting communities and community leader groups coordinated and organized has
    a long gestation period. It's very much like a startup; it takes a few years to
    build your team, try out an NVP, then discover that you need to change everything.
    We are now much more focused on children and parents and prevention of diabetes.
    If you can help the parents be better parents, or you change the children's experience
    positively, that's what's going to pay off best in the long run. \n\nDiscussions
    now center on [the opioid crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/truth-us-opioid-crisis-too-easy-blame-doctors-not-prescriptions);
    they keep talking about the drugs, but they should also be talking about why people
    are so vulnerable to these drugs. What makes them unable to resist? Not everybody
    who takes an opioid suddenly gets addicted, yet a number of people do and that's
    partly because their childhood was so insecure. It’s very hard if you've grown
    up not being able to trust the people around you. There's a lot of data on so-called
    adverse childhood experience that show direct correlation between that and addiction,
    unemployment, crime and all kinds of social ills. So we are trying to go upstream
    and address it from the start. \n\n**Travis:** _Are you working with the communities
    to define those measures and strategies, or are they coming to you?_\n\n**Esther:**
    We put out a call for applications in 2014. Forty-two communities applied; we
    picked five. Our role is like a personal trainer, or perhaps a startup coach.
    It's still the community that has to do the work; it’s their people; it's ultimately
    their achievement. We might eventually make ourselves unnecessary, but in the
    meantime, we can give them advice, introduce them to what the other communities
    are doing, introduce them to vendors and to potential funding sources. Way to
    Wellness was funded by me and I'd certainly love others to join, but the community
    projects are funded directly by funders, whether it is Medicaid, or philanthropy
    or a government grant; it's between those funders and the communities. It's theirs,
    not ours and we are not looking to be visible or recognized. We are looking for
    them to take on the responsibility, do the work, make a difference, train their
    own people and have something to be really proud of.\n\n**Travis:** _It's exciting
    to hear when people are working with communities, especially some small communities.
    What happens after that initial 10-year period?_\n\n**Esther:** The goal is to
    build something sustainable. Instead of, “Oh we have a class for 60 overweight
    women.” We want to hear, “We have now trained 30 dieticians and nutritional counselors,
    exercise coaches and they are community members, and they now have jobs and they
    are keeping those people healthy.”  This is the problem: Just as people get addicted
    to drugs, ironically, communities and nonprofits often get addicted to pilots.
    The pilots are great. We often hear, \"This pilot’s going to be really wonderful
    and we'll have a trial with 30 people.” The pilot works then we often hear \"We've
    run out of funding and the funders want to do something more innovative.\" We
    are not trying to do something innovative; we are trying to do something that
    works and then scale it. \n\nWhen Walmart opens a store, they are not running
    a pilot to see if the store works. If the store somehow isn't working, they find
    a new manager, they do more training, but they don't say, \"Oh, the concept of
    this really doesn't work.\" We are trying to get that kind of accountability.
    These programs work, if effective people are brought in, screened and trained.
    People need transportation, as well. There are lots of local challenges that you
    need to overcome. There's no magic here; there's simply implementation, persistence,
    and being in it for the long-term, versus \"we'll get some results and then see
    what happens.\" \n\n**Travis:** _As you were talking through that in terms of
    building something that is sustainable, real, and can scale, I imagine that's
    the same thing you would say to some of the companies that you invest in and how
    they should view pilots._\n\n**Esther:** Yes, very much. Don't be afraid to try.
    Work under the assumption that it will work and if it doesn't work, figure out
    why. In a startup you are doing things people have never done before. People have
    done diabetes prevention programs before. They have trained communities better.
    What we are not doing is coming to these communities and doing exotic research
    and turning people into specimens. We are helping them do things that typically
    don't scale. Instead of doing something that is often different, you are trying
    to do something new that hasn't been tried before and learn from failing. In our
    communities, you learn from failing. Maybe we need to train people better or maybe
    we didn't market this program effectively enough or we need to provide some type
    of incentive or we need to provide child care so that people can attend the course,
    because hey, they don't have childcare — what a surprise! It's those kinds of
    things.\n\n> It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need to
    make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't understand
    that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals. Many companies
    think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how to actually get
    it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.\" -Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis:**
    _I want to shift gears a little and talk about one of the company that you are
    invested in, I read something about a merger between Digi.me and Personal. In
    terms of joining forces, they are looking to address the challenges around enhancing
    privacy with healthcare data. But at the same time, enabling people to share and
    potentially combine and analyze data. As you think about your investment there,
    can you share your thoughts on the importance that must be made by healthcare
    IT companies on privacy and security?_\n\n**Esther:** Privacy and security are
    really important but to some extent, there are regular privacy breaches, which
    is an issue to fix. Privacy and [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    often obstruct good healthcare. What you need for good healthcare is to know more
    about the person, not just their result on a particular test. Where do they live?
    What is their income level? In case of opioids, have they applied for drugs at
    any other place? Do they have multiple sources of supply? It’s not a complicated
    thing, it's having both security, privacy and effective data sharing. That's what
    is challenging. It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need
    to make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't
    understand that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals.
    Many companies think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how
    to actually get it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.
    \n\n**Travis:** _How do you advise companies to help them navigate that path towards
    implementing the solution and into the workflow of the health system?_\n\n**Esther:**
    I'm generally pretty skeptical. I was just at the doctor earlier this week and
    had blood tests. I got the tests back and they were in a PDF. What I'd really
    like to see is my FitBit data and other personal data, to determine how the blood
    tests changed over time. What I had was a long list of PDFs from various dates
    that were completely useless. Part of the problem is that most of these institutions
    are using large legacy mainframe systems that are incredibly cumbersome. You really
    start to think: \"Throw this all out and start fresh.\" That's what a number of
    vendors are doing but of course, it is very hard to replace the huge installs
    of these systems. \n\nI'm on the board of a company called Wellpass, and invested
    in quite a few others, including 4D Healthware, Healthcelerate, [HealthLoop](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/healthloop/),
    Vital Score. They all sell into healthcare systems, and need to understand how
    they work. I don't think a twenty-two year old who just graduated from Stanford
    can know how to fix the healthcare system. You need to have someone that has actually
    worked in a hospital or an insurance company on your team. That's not just so
    you have contacts, but more importantly so that you understand the context, how
    the system works, how the data actually flows. I went to a continuing medical
    education conference once; they had this table where they were handing out medical
    advice for doctors. There was a stack of stapled handouts — twenty-five sheets
    each, double-sided, so fifty pages per handout. Each page was a spreadsheet about
    some particular thing the doctor should do with their patient during the patient
    interview — which of course lasts max fifteen minutes. As a doctor, they are probably
    spending eight or nine minutes typing and and five minutes actually talking. Now
    here’s this sheet of fifty things they are supposed to be doing; some of them
    they’re already doing, and some are only for teenagers and or for women. But you,
    as a vendor, you have to understand that you are either replacing one of those
    fifty things, or adding to them. Do you really understand that context? Can you
    fit into it or make it better with your extra page? Of course, some things are
    for the administrator, or the nurse discharging patients. But whatever your tool
    does, how does it make those people’s lives better and easier? \n\nThat's the
    challenge. Healthcare is a very cumbersome and change-resistant marketplace. The
    companies that have been the most successful are the ones that are eroding things
    around the edges. I love this marketplace because it is interesting and important
    but, if you want to be in this marketplace, you need to understand the challenges.\n\n**Travis:**
    _As we think of how to augment, expand, extend, or in some way work with the EHR
    and EHR data — taking that data and transform it into something a bit more meaningful
    than a CCD or some big PDF — I'm curious what you are finding there._\n\n**Esther:**
    One company out there called PicnicHealth will take your medical records and automatically
    parse them as much as they can and then have humans do the rest. They will have
    people on the phone calling to get your medical documents from all these different
    vendors or different providers and they will make them all into one piece that
    is intelligible. That is really an exciting proposition. As I was just talking
    about my blood draws, I realized I should just call them up and see how they are
    doing and use the service. \n\nThe challenge, of course, is that there are so
    many different varieties and layouts. There is an accepted medical vocabulary
    but there are always little exceptions here and there. A blood value is not something
    you want to get wrong. For the patient, but also for the doctor, you want to make
    sure that if you are comparing data from multiple sources, you want to make sure
    the data is absolutely consistent across all these different sources. It's a challenge
    and there is both a real danger to people and real liability to companies if they
    do it wrong. So, it's going to be a slow process. The more standardized things
    get, the better. Whether you are on a Mac or a PC, we can amazingly have this
    conversation, across different kinds of computers and it is working, more or less.
    \n\n**Travis:** _It is interesting to see how different companies are approaching
    that challenge, both from a consumer standpoint and from FHIR and direct-to-consumer
    enablement authorization of data._\n\n**Esther:** At one end, somebody like [Apple
    and HealthKit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-healthcare/)
    is really fostering that. It’s possible; consider how it happened in banking,
    with Intuit. They had this tool Quicken that would let individual bank customers
    interact with their bank portals. Intuit started by reverse-engineering the interfaces
    of a couple of big banks - probably Citibank and BankAmerica (I’m not sure) -
    so users of those banks could download their own data and manage it for themselves,
    even consolidating data from multiple accounts. At first, the banks were very
    resistant but after the first two or three were done, and the customers started
    engaging more with their banks, the other banks noticed. They started saying,
    \"Wow, they are not losing their customers; in fact, those banks are getting even
    more buy-in from their customers. We want this, too.\" They went to Intuit and
    said, \"Please do an API [application program interface] for us.” Suddenly the
    dynamics had changed. Intuit came back and said, “If you want to hook up your
    banks to us, then you have to do the work, but sure, we'd be glad to let you address
    our customer base.” With luck, that's what's going to happen in healthcare. There
    are going to be a lot of vendors now that are interested in working with HealthKit
    and other intermediaries. You are beginning to get this widespread recognition
    that, of course, individuals should be able to see their Fitbit data matched against
    their RunKeeper data and someday matched against blood draws and all the other
    stuff.\n\n**Travis:** _I want to follow up on something else you said. There's
    been a ton of investment in the digital healthcare space over the last five to
    ten years. You mentioned about having someone with experience on the actual care
    side. Can you share two or three consistent success threads that help take a startup
    from a seed investment up through multiple series, from A to B to C?_\n\n**Esther:**
    Basically it all comes down to the team. You need to know something; you need
    to work together effectively; but then you need to be willing to learn and change
    into it; be agile and be humble and all this kind stuff. It's really the attitude
    of “I love what I'm doing, I'm learning from what I'm doing and I'm responding
    to what I'm learning.” Then, it helps if you have a good idea and you are working
    with interesting problems. There are lots of specifics to health or healthcare
    but the fundamental things that make startups successful are pretty much the same.
    \n\n**Travis:** _Curious on team, and investing in team, as you look at presentations
    and pitch decks, do you have an opinion on an ideal team or an ideal mix of people
    on a team that you like to see and you like to invest in._\n\n**Esther:** Very
    clearly, it doesn't consist of the three best people in the world, it consists
    of the best team of three or four, or whatever. A lot of people miss one out of
    the three or four, but you need someone with medical industry knowledge and connections;
    you need someone with technical capacity to build what you need; you need someone
    who understands, whether it is the consumer or the healthcare system that you
    are selling into; but, you also need someone who understands the user proposition,
    especially in healthcare where often the payer is not the same as the user. The
    payer may be the insurance company or the individual, but it may be that the payer
    is the hospital, but the user is a doctor or a nurse. \n\nIt goes back to the
    old software industry, where there was this wonderful set of companies called
    value-added resellers (VARs). They would take the product and go find a corporate
    customer. They would train the IT department and help IT install the software.
    Then they would train the users — the employees making phone calls or doing accounting
    or customer support. The VARs understood it was their problem to make the buyers
    — and the buyers’ employees — like the product. Without VARs, the software vendors'
    customers would usually pilot the software and think it was great, but then they
    would buy it and find out they couldn't get their employees to use it. The vendor
    got the money the first few times and started getting bad references for the product.\n\nI
    think we need a better understanding of the role of VARs (or whatever you want
    to call them these days) in the healthcare market. Whether it’s a third-party
    VAR or your own sales support, you need someone who understands how the hospital
    works, or how the insurance company works to insert their product into the workflow
    and actually make it useful and make the end-user customer say, \"Oh my gosh,
    this makes my job so much easier. I can do referrals automatically instead of
    having to handwrite something on a piece of paper and give it to my nurse and
    she puts it on my desk and it gets lost and I don't get the referral back and
    forth with the other doctors.\" And, of course, the patient doesn't get the benefit
    of going to see the dermatologist.\n\n**Travis:** _Before we conclude the interview,
    Esther, I wanted to ensure we covered everything on the Way to Wellville so that
    we didn’t miss anything there._\n\n**Esther:** Well, I did want to mention [the
    five Wellville communities](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/), just in case
    in case anybody listening either lives in one of them or is nearby. The Wellville
    partner in Muskegon County, Michigan, which is the one that I work with most closely,
    is called [1 in 21](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/muskegon-michigan/).
    The Wellville partner in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is called [Spartanburg’s
    Way to Wellville](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/spartanburg-south-carolina/).
    There's [Hope Rising](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/lake-county-california/)
    in Lake County, California, which is just north of Silicon Valley. There's [Way
    to Wellville: Clatsop County](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/clatsop-county-oregon/),
    northwest of Portland, Oregon. And there's the [Triple Aim Collaborative](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/north-hartford-connecticut/)
    in North Hartford, Connecticut. These are all real places with real people. They
    are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just places that have
    decided they would like a better future for their residents. We are helping them
    build that for themselves. You can find us at [wellville.net](http://www.wellville.net).\n\n**Travis:**
    _Wonderful. Thank you for joining us today, Esther._\n\n**Esther:** Likewise,

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
