  from previous years, but drastically different. And in good ways. Everything, from
  the venue to the sessions to the attendees, was impressive. HITRUST did a great

:post: |2

  ## HITRUST 2018 was all about the cloud

  In terms of the content, the major change was the focus on cloud. We’ve been attending the conference for four years and I feel like Datica (Catalyze at the time) was the only organization talking about the cloud at the HITRUST conference four years ago. Almost every session I attended this year was focused on the cloud or had the cloud as the underlying context for the session. This reflects the broader shift in the market but is well timed for HITRUST as most attendees were beginning their journeys to the cloud and doing it with HITRUST as the anchoring framework for that journey.

  ## New HITRUST Shared Responsibility Program

  Along those same lines, HITRUST is working hard to embrace the cloud and announced its [Shared Responsibility Program]( https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-program-addresses-security-risks-inefficiencies-leveraging-cloud-service-providers/) this week to coincide with the conference. Shared Responsibility is tied directly to compliance on the cloud as vendors work with CSPs, SaaS vendors, and other cloud platform companies offering solutions for various aspects of infrastructure. It is good to see HITRUST pushing this forward by offering a Shared Responsibility Program that I hope will extend and add value to the [shared responsibility models](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) currently in existence from cloud vendors.

  The sessions themselves, both the breakout and the main room sessions, were well thought out and the speakers I saw were good. Most of the speakers had real-world experience with the topics they were discussing, something I don’t always see at conferences. Engagement from attendees was good as well; most sessions had a healthy amount of interaction between speakers and the audience.

  ## Smaller organizations were featured

  One thing I particularly appreciated about the event was the sessions that involved smaller organizations. Four years ago, the speakers I remember were either from HITRUST or from large payors. This year’s event featured many speakers from smaller entities, [Datica included](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/events/hitrust-2018/). This reflects the goal of HITRUST to engage the smaller end of the market, from startups to growth stage vendors, looking to anchor on a compliance framework, which is smart because the agility of smaller organizations means that is where a lot of innovation is currently found. I think educating vendors is the best way to get them to adopt HITRUST and to ultimately help HITRUST become a de-facto standard across both sides of the market—large enterprises and their vendors or partners.

  ## The Complete Cloud Compliance book was introduced

  <img class="lozad float-right" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=400" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=200&q=20" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance" width="200" />

  On a personal note, we launched our book [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com/) this week and were offering free, and sometimes signed, copies for conference attendees. Underscoring the theme of cloud this week, the response to the book was huge. We underestimated demand for the book and had to overnight additional copies to ensure we had some for the final day of the conference. We are now out of books, but will have more in the coming weeks. [Sign up to get a download of chapter 2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/) of the book now, and to be notified when general purchase is available on Amazon.com.

    ## Why we wrote a book

    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?fm=jpg&w=150&q=20" class="float-right lozad" data-src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?w=300" width="150" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance Book" />

    In 2013, when Datica was founded as [Catalyze](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/catalyze), the cloud was a simpler place. AWS was the only public cloud that signed a meaningful [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), but they only had a handful of services (or "primitives") within scope. Even so, to sign the BAA, which was under NDA, required customers use dedicated instances which meant digital health companies had to spend a minimum $1,400 per month just to get started — and that doesn’t even account for the cost to solve [the remaining 9/10ths of compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-kubernetes-service/aws/). Docker wasn't yet version 1.0, and [Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) wasn't even a thing yet. The term "microservices" meant nothing. Modern container-based cloud architectures that were fully HIPAA compliant and could be HITRUST CSF Certified were impossible on the public cloud until [Catalyze's first platform-as-a-service product](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/catalyze-closes-series-a-funding-to-expand-development-of-its-healthcare-platform/) came along.

    Fast forward to 2018, and the cloud is a very different place. __We are now living in a post-cloud world.__ That post-cloud world is built on managed services. AWS is now up to hundreds of these services and dozens within scope of their BAA. Azure and GCP sign rock-solid BAAs consisting of just as many world-class services and all three are competing to be a viable destination for digital health workloads. Many independent managed services, like MongoDB's Atlas, sign BAAs now, too. The typical cloud architecture is a constellation of managed services using a microservices-based scheme. Just the other day, I was speaking to a digital health developer who mentioned his company uses the basics like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway, but is using BigQuery on GCP for machine learning and investigating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Cosmos as an eventual Kubernetes destination, while also incorporating MongoDB Atlas, Auth0, and a handful of independent logging and monitoring services. Whew. This is not manic decision making. This is the new normal.

    > Compliance has not kept up. We know this first hand.

    The issues are foundational, from our experience. Compliance officers are often attorneys and not technologists so they have a hard time grasping how fast abstraction on the cloud is moving. Likewise, engineers are not legal scholars, so they have a tough time wrapping their heads around a proper compliance program that is the difference between their app being adopted by hospitals or dying on the vine. I still personally have about one conversation a day with a developer where I have to coach them that [HIPAA is a government regulation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) while [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) is a certification framework.

    In 2013, the cloud was built for an operator archetype, the type of employee who could secure Virtual Machines (VMs) and contribute to a compliance program. After five years, the cloud is now designed for developers who can easily interchange services with a few clicks. What we are seeing is this new archetype is not ready for security and compliance in a managed services world. All we have to do is look around to find news stories of the situation. [Just last month, an improperly configured AWS S3 bucket lead to 31,000 GoDaddy servers to be exposed](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/09/amazon-aws-error-exposes-31-000-godaddy-servers/).

    These foundational challenges are why we wrote _Complete Cloud Compliance_. Our goal is always to help the healthcare community, but educating people on such heady topics extended beyond a blog post or online knowledge base. A book proved to be the right medium. Travis Good (Datica CEO) and I started the writing process earlier this year with the first edition printed last month.

    ## Structure of the book

    The book starts out with a basic introduction then flows into the following chapter setup:

    1. __The Business Case for Compliance__ — an examination on why compliance actually matters to regulated companies like digital health.
    2. __[What _Really_ is Compliance?](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/)__ — We tried very hard to be simple and concise while also educating complex topics to those who are fresh to the respective domains. Consequently, this chapter breaks down critical compliance concepts with a developer reader in mind, meaning compliance officers will find the content familiar. Feedback from developers has been fantastic, however.
    3. __What _Really_ is the Cloud?__ — The cloud is not a computer in somebody else's data center. It's software-enabled infrastructure services built for software developers. This chapter was written for this post-cloud world, but it does lay some basic foundational concepts to help educate business folks. Feedback from engineers to compliance officers to business users has been very positive.
    4. __Why Data Interoperability Matters__ — Readers will find a consistent theme throughout the book: data is splintering, not consolidating, which makes compliance even harder. This chapter uses healthcare to explain how interoperability matters to compliance.
    5. __Complete Cloud Compliance__ — After the context is set, we give a detailed overview on how regulated companies can employ a compliance program that genuinely gives them dynamic, continuous compliance on an ever-changing cloud. We call the program Complete Cloud Compliance, as the book title implies, and 3C for short throughout.
    6. __Best Practices for Complete Cloud Compliance__ — With the 3C program in mind, we then provide a few dozen best practice pieces of advice for managing compliance on the cloud.
    7. __The Achievable Mandate__ — Readers within regulated companies should not fear the future, but embrace it because it's critical for survival. The good news is controlling compliance on the cloud is possible.

    ## Visually explaining compliance

    The book is purposefully very visual. The reasoning is pretty simple. Ultimately, this is a very boring and very complex topic. We don't pretend that this is the most exciting domain just because we live in it everyday. No, compliance is mind-numbingly boring.

    But it is critical to the future success of regulated companies, and by extension digital health. We fundamentally believe that unless healthcare can get on the cloud, it is at grave risk of falling even further behind, to which compliance is a blocker.

    To combat the boring nature of our lovable domain, we went heavy on visual storytelling. Readers will find sprinkled throughout the book several infographics geared as simplifying extremely complex topics. We think it worked well.

    Take this image for example. In chapter two (which is downloadable at the end of this post), we break down the differences between regulations, standards developing organizations, standards themselves, and frameworks. When we get to the frameworks section, we wanted to make clear that it is wise to work with frameworks that are built for the future, to which HITRUST is a good choice. When demonstrating the point, we charted the lineage of influences dating back almost a century that went into HITRUST's CSF. We thought it told an interesting story.

    ## The 9 Big Ideas

    Woven throughout the book are nine big ideas, many of which are brand-new ways of thinking by Datica that we are thrilled to start to share with the community. They are:

    1.  [When controlled, compliance is actually a competitive edge.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-a-competitive-edge-cee13073cf54 "Read more on this topic")
    2.  [The cloud is no longer other people's computers. It is managed services.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/the-cloud-is-software-for-developers-not-hardware-for-operations-9503c0e3e86 "Read more on this topic")
    3.  [As cloud services get more abstract to improve developer experience (a good thing), more control is being taken away from the user making compliance attestation harder (a bad thing).](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/shared-responsibility-on-the-cloud-a-solution-for-managed-services-or-opacity-for-cloud-customers-fc01fbe18897 "Read more on this topic")
    4.  [Compliance is only as strong as the weakest link in the abstraction chain.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/abstraction-on-the-cloud-increases-the-risk-of-weak-links-4641e20c0bbc "Read more on this topic")
    5.  Frameworks are the best way to manage regulations. The best frameworks are built for a dynamic future, not a dated past.
    6.  Complete cloud compliance is hard because technologists struggle to understand compliance while compliance officers struggle to understand the cloud.
    7.  [The cloud is global, so compliance is now global.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-now-global-because-the-cloud-is-global-d938de1626ea "Read more on this topic")
    8.  [Cloud compliance comes down to data management. The three verbs of data are store, compute, and transmit.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/from-ehrs-to-data-driven-healthcare-c33e0e27ee95 "Read more on this topic")
    9.  Data sources are splintering instead of unifying, making compliance more complex.

    You will see us publish more about these big ideas throughout 2018.

    worksheet will help.
  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on
    the cloud. Sometimes it''s simple, like how long to retain PHI data for disaster
    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,
    like if the emergent serverless computing paradigm meets the requirements of global
    compliance regimes (answer: it depends, but pull up a chair).'
  :post: |2

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

  :summary: HITRUST is a superset security framework and understanding both the advantages
    and disadvantages of this will help you wield HITRUST successfully.
  :blog_lead: One big reason HITRUST is taken so seriously is how it is composed of
    a long list of other security and risk management frameworks. HITRUST is a superset
    security framework and understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of
    this point goes a long way in understanding how to wield HITRUST successfully.
  :post: "The HITRUST Alliance purposefully took the best parts of past frameworks
    to mold its \"Common Security Framework\" or CSF. The [HITRUST CSF](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    is then a list of more than seven hundred controls with the best parts of PCI,
    NIST, and more in mind. Let's walk through the composite list.\n\n## The HITRUST
    list\n\nIn HITRUST's official introduction, it lists out the sources of influence:\n\n*
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Principles
    and Criteria\n* Catalog of Minimum Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-E)
    – Exchange Reference Architecture (ERA) Supplement v2\n* Center for Internet Security
    (CIS) Critical Security Controls v6\n* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) Omnibus Final Rule\n* IRS Publication 1075, Tax Information Security
    Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies: Safeguards for Protecting Federal
    Tax Returns and Return Information (New)\n* ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Information Technology—Security
    Techniques—Information Security Management Systems Requirements\n* ISO/IEC 27002:2013,
    Information Technology—Security Techniques—Code of Practice for Information Security
    Controls\n* ISO/IEC 27799:2008 Health Informatics (guidance for information security
    management for healthcare organizations using ISO/IEC 27002:2005)\n* National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)\n*
    NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity v1\n* Control
    Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT) v4.1\n* Payment Card
    Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard v3.2\n* Federal privacy requirements (e.g.,
    HHS)\n* State security requirements (e.g., Nevada, Massachusetts, and Texas)\n*
    Experiences and best practices of HITRUST participants\n\n## The positives and
    negatives of HITRUST CSF certification\n\nThere are positives and negatives to
    thinking about [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) as a superset framework.\n\nFirst,
    the main negative: If you become HITRUST CSF Certified, you are **not** certified
    or compliant with the above list. If you want to be SOC2 certified or PCI compliant,
    you must still conduct those assessments independently with your auditor. If your
    business is such where it's mandatory you provide those defined assurances, it
    means you have other audits to manage and pay for. That can be frustrating.\n\nBut
    there are many positives to HITRUST's superset nature. The biggest is the credibility
    and thoroughness attributed to a certification. Most compliance and security officers
    at covered entities are adopting HITRUST as the best and only required way to
    assess business associates because they know if someone is HITRUST CSF Certified,
    they have gone through a thorough process to prove assurances.\n\nThe other positive
    is the overall reduction in cost for your company to prove security and compliance.
    Again, within the framing that it's not necessarily a hard requirement to show
    PCI compliance, et al, your organization can effectively demonstrate credibility
    within those 14 frameworks in a one-time shot. We've written a case study about
    [our own HITRUST certification costs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/),
    which average somewhere around $20,000-$60,000 depending on scope.\n\nIf you are
    working on a project which requires compliance and are looking into HITRUST, consider
    us a resource. We'd be happy to chat more about the benefits of HITRUST on the
    cloud. \n\n"

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
