:post: "(image: sxsw1.png)\r\n\r\nWe often find HIPAA's perceived complexity exists
  mainly due to lack of awareness or education, which is not the fault of digital
  health startups or those new to healthcare. Instead, it's the fault of poorly designed
  and inaccessible resources. We strongly believe that we are helping to accelerate
  innovation within healthcare not just through our [products](https://catalyze.io/products),
  but also through our [free educational content](https://catalyze.io/learn). Making
  ourselves available at events  to answer questions and lend advice is all part of
  our mission to lessen the burden of HIPAA on those who want to change healthcare.\r\n\r\n(image:
  sxsw2.png)\r\n\r\n### Looking ahead to HIMSS 2015\r\n\r\nApril 12-16 sees the bulk
  of the healthcare technology world descend upon Chicago for 2015's HIMSS conference.
  Catalyze is attending. [Travis](https://catalyze.io/travis) and [Mohan](https://catalyze.io/mohan)
  along with our integrations lead Mark Olschesky will be walking the floor. We will
  have a physical presence at booth 1699, hosted by fellow Madison health technology
  firm [Nordic](http://www.nordicwi.com/).\r\n\r\nIf you have an interest in meeting
  someone from the team, please feel free to message them on twitter or send us an
  email at [hello@catalyze.io](mailto:hello@catalyze.io) to be connected.\r\n\r\nThere
  are many great events, panels, and conversations planned. We are in particular looking
  forward to the new [Cybersecurity Command Center](http://www.himssconference.org/exhibition/cybersecurity-command-center),
  which is stacked with intriguing discussions Monday through Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOf
  course, the [Innovation](http://www.himssconference.org/networking/innovation) networking
  event looks promising, along with the [CIO Forum](http://www.himssconference.org/education/cio-forum).
  Both align well with the ethos of our [Innovation Series](https://catalyze.io/innovation).\r\n\r\n[#HIMSS15](http://www.himssconference.org/updates/update.aspx?ItemNumber=40200)
  kicks off two weeks from today, and we are excited to attend.\r\n\r\n"
