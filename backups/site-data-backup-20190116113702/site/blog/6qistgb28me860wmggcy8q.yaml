:summary: In a digitally interconnected world, people with behavioral health conditions
  consult their technologies long before approaching healthcare providers for further
  diagnosis and treatment. What would be the benefit in approaching a healthcare provider
  immediately anyways? Behavioral healthcare is insufficient in assisting diagnosis,
  overseeing treatment response, and evaluating disease acuity. In contrast to other
  healthcare fields, psychiatric care is founded on a conversational Q&A model, rather
  than physical exams, clinical trials, or laboratory testing.

:post: "As a result, behavioral healthcare is a rapidly growing, but often a neglected
  sector in the healthcare industry. This specialty presents both many opportunities
  and challenges; inadequate funding being one of those challenges. Sadly, behavioral
  healthcare remains the proverbial stepchild, never seeing the therapeutic breakthroughs
  or [innovation](/innovation) necessary to be in the spotlight. However, the opportunities
  remain. The health economic burden is massive and the life expectancy of patients
  is considerably less, due to their conditions being difficult to treat, an overwhelming
  challenge in patient monitoring and overall subpar patient care. Innovative behavioral
  health technologies have a great opportunity to contribute to change in this area.\n\nWith
  the Web being accessible from nearly all handheld devices, patients are turning
  to tablets and smartphones in search of further healthcare information, to connect
  with online support communities and to discover possible treatment options. Digital
  health technologies are offering the ability for fiscally effective, long-term remote
  monitoring of patients with mental health issues. New mobile applications and Web
  portals are enabling patients and caretakers to gauge and communicate status updates
  to the care team on a regular basis from wherever the patient may reside, enabling
  telehealth assessments and therapeutic interventions. \n\nOne application that is
  successfully connecting and innovating behavioral healthcare is [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io/).
  This application takes a look at statistics and mobile usage patterns to map regular
  behavior to convert into insights about managing personal health. Always running
  in the background, the app monitors call and text activity, as well as location
  and movement in the most general sense. To be more specific, the app will not track
  if you are at the beach or calling your sister, but will rather determine if you
  have remained in one location all day or have disregarded contact with others. By
  analyzing these general behavioral patterns, [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io/) can
  notify the user if unusual activity or a disruption occurs in regular behavior and
  relates what next actions to consider. \n\nOther behavioral heatlhcare apps to check
  out that are furthering innovation:\n\n- [Lantern](https://golantern.com/) is a
  web and mobile based platform that combines cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques
  with advice from real experts. Users start by taking an assessment test to determine
  their strengths and weaknesses in five areas: body, stress/anxiety, mood, sleep,
  and social life. Lantern provides daily exercises tailored to suit users’ needs
  based on the results of their assessment. Each user is also matched with a professional
  coach trained in CBT who can provide feedback and answer any questions.\n- [Optimism](http://www.findingoptimism.com/)
  is a family of applications that focuses on self-tracking as a tool for coping with
  mental illnesses including depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and PTSD. The
  app helps users detect patterns in their mood, creating a way to identify triggers
  and other things that affect their mental health. Users can create a customizable
  wellness plan to chart their coping mechanisms, and this can be updated as they
  come to have a deeper understanding of what they need to tackle for their mental
  illness.\n- [TalkSpace](http://www.talkspace.com/) seeks to make therapy more available
  by connecting users with one of more 200 licensed therapists via messaging. With
  a subscription to Talkspace, users get matched to a therapist to chat with at any
  time. \n- [Big White Wall](https://www.bigwhitewall.com/landing-pages/landingv3.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
  is a community application where people suffering from various mental illnesses
  can come together and talk about their problems with support from trained therapists.
  The app features discussion boards, reference articles, and self-assessment tests.
  Users can also register for online therapy programs. Big White Wall also lets users
  create a “brick, ” which is a collage of pictures and images meant to encourage
  users to express themselves. The program focuses on anonymity as a way for members
  to feel fewer stigmas about sharing their problems.\n- [IntelliCare](https://www.intellicare.com.ph/)
  is a suite of apps created by researchers at Northwestern University to target symptoms
  of depression and anxiety. The apps were developed as part of a national research
  study funded by the National Institutes of Health. The suite includes the IntelliCare
  Hub app and 12 mini apps. \n\nKnow of any other innovative apps in the behavioral
