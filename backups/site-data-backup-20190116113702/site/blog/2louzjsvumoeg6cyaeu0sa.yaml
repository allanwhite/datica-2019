  :description: FHIR is the latest standard to be developed under the HL7 organization.
    Pronounced 'Fire' , FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
    I think it's the most interesting standard to have come out of HL7 since the original
    HL7 protocol.

  And there is an extraordinary amount of these [innovative collaborations](https://catalyze.io/solutions/enterprise-innovation)
  happening across the country already. Influencing creative solutions to complex
  problems, startups and healthcare innovators are working to manage the challenges
  the industry is facing. However, the difficulty of achieving interoperability still

:post: "Why is interoperability the bottleneck though? To answer that having an understanding
  of what interoperability is must be had.  On a macro level, interoperability is
  the United States’ attempt at creating a point-of-care health information system
  that contends with the worldwide network of electronic banking. Understood from
  a business perspective, interoperability is just tech jargon for healthcare information
  that is is necessary for a required constituent of diagnosis and treatment. An interoperable
  world is one where [health data](https://catalyze.io/solutions/data-integration-control)
  can be exchanged, is portable and available wherever a healthcare consumer receives
  care. So true transfiguration mandates complete access to data from the entirety
  of patient records, trouncing the traditional isolation silos of healthcare.\n\nPromising
  progress has been made as a widespread increase in interoperability initiatives
  are underway. Showing market maturity, most providers have implemented electronic
  health record (EHR) systems with more than ninety percent of hospitals and seventy
  percent of ambulatory physicians. Because the healthcare industry is so fragmented,
  standardization is complex and convoluted but industry stakeholders are still pushing
  the interoperability needle forward.\n\nInteroperability is going to also be a fundamental
  requirement for guaranteeing the widespread adoption of EHR systems to achieve the
  economic and social advantages desired. In the absence of interoperability, this
  adoption of EHR systems will only enhance the information silos that exist today
  with even more proprietary control over patient data. Adopting EHRs that are not
  interoperable is highly questionable as it would not increase patients’ security,
  well-being, or health. On the contrary, once true interoperability is achieved,
  patients will have greater choice, control, and portability with their healthcare
  data. \n\nThoughts on interoperability and how the industry is going to make it
  happen? [Tweet](https://twitter.com/daticahealth) or [email](mailto:hello@datica.com)
