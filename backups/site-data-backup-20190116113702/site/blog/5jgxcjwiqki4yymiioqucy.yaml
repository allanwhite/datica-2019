:summary: Great journeys begin with a single step. Is Apple putting its considerable
  weight behind helping people take more control of their health?
:blog_lead: 'The world has been mesmerized (as always) by the Apple WWDC. One of the
  areas which is generating a lot of interest and excitement is Healthkit. Heck, we
  [wrote](https://catalyze.io/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-mobile-app-developers/)
  about it as well.  Healthkit''s [website](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/)
  describes it as something that "*allows apps that provide health and fitness services
  to share their data with the new Health app and with each other. A user’s health
  information is stored in a centralized and secure location and the user decides
  which data should be shared with your app.*"  Words like "game changing" and "revolutionary"
  are being thrown around. But I''m not so sure if those are the words I would use.

:post: "I informally polled a cross section of physician friends of mine about it
  - ranging from direct primary care physicians, family practitioners, concierge physicians
  and so on to get some feedback on it. And it was very illuminating:\r\n\r\n- The
  direct primary care and concierge physicians were all for it. Why? Because most
  of their patients (and they themselves) were iPhone users. They could also see how
  this would allow them to provide a higher level of service to their clients.\r\n-
  Almost every other physician felt it would have almost zero impact on their patient
  population.\r\n\r\nWhat is challenging to me is how to say what I want to say without
  getting into a flamewar. So let me set the baseline - I have an iPhone (have had
  every alternate year's model), own a Mac or two, own an iPad or two. So I do like
  Apple products. This post is **not about Apple or its products**. This post is about
  trying to provide some opinions on the likely impact of Healthkit and the quantified
  self movement in general.\r\n\r\nSo here are a few facts:\r\n\r\n### 1. The majority
  of healthcare costs are due to chronic diseases\r\n\r\n![blog-main-healthkit-chart-1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5H6hsz6AVii0W8EOEEm4OS/3228fc5b37fe71dcdc103a97e91b6e67/blog-main-healthkit-chart-1.png)\r\n\r\nThis
  has been written up about quite a bit. We all know this so I won't belabor the point.
  However, the key point to note here is that....\r\n\r\n### 2. The majority of these
  patients are not quantified self-ers\r\n\r\n![blog-main-healthkit-chart-2](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5xp627eiVG0I04k8kUC4c4/bac60d527234daa3def0a6f0b7bdbd4a/blog-main-healthkit-chart-2.png)\r\n\r\nPeople
  with chronic diseases do track some of their activity per [this](http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/28/tracking-for-health/)
  Pew report. A closer look at the data, shows this set of data.\r\n\r\n![blog-main-healthkit-chart-3](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3cpQaxYpdmwY2AWgkWWygk/72aca186b2658a1bb978ecb33e3f81b3/blog-main-healthkit-chart-3.png)\r\n\r\nBasically
  indicating that the populations most in need of tracking health don't do it as much
  nor do they use electronic means to do so.\r\n\r\nLet's add one more factoid to
  this set of data - the distribution of iPhone and Android across income levels.\r\n\r\n![blog-main-healthkit-chart-4](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/16OHSkLimCkUYEQAkUaGmS/7d02eb2beb6929b18fd341076a523cbe/blog-main-healthkit-chart-4.png)\r\n\r\nPut
  all that together and we realize that the population most in need of tracking tools
  are barely using or impacted by Healthkit. My physician friends were right - Healthkit
  is likely to have little to no impact on actually addressing the key challenges
  around chronic disease.\r\n\r\n### 3. Physicians are constrained on time, payments\r\n\r\nPhysicians
  are already strapped for time and have traditionally been very leery of the quality
  and reliability of patient generated data and making clinical decisions on the basis
  of that information. Travis wrote about [this](https://catalyze.io/blog/lets-encourage-secure-sharing-of-health-data/)
  and I quote,  \"I have personal experiences with family that have wanted to share
  their own data and been blown off by physicians. An example is my dad. We got him
  an iPhone-connected glucometer a couple years ago and, in his excitement, he emailed
  his endocrinologist his data ahead of an appointment. The endocrinologist flat out
  told him that he couldn't really use the data. My dad now sends me his weekly reports
  of blood sugars, which is helpful because I can encourage him but it would be great
  if his physician supported and encouraged his enthusiasm for self-care.\"\r\n\r\nSharing
  should be encouraged so perhaps the move to present a default way to access and
  view summaries of the data could be welcomed. The concern that the physicians I
  talked to had was that, while patients being more interested in their health is
  always welcome, more available data implies more time, more correlation, and potentially
  more liability.\r\n\r\nGreat journeys begin with a single step. I'm a big fan of
  the quantified self movement as it is my hope that this will extend soon to folks
  who are likely to benefit the most from it. Perhaps Apple putting its considerable
  weight behind it will just be the impetus it needs to make it more widespread.\r\n\r\nGreat
  journeys also begin with a destination in mind - and that is what I want to call
  attention to. The destination for us, if we're serious about impacting healthcare
  costs, is figuring out how to engage the low income, 60 year old with COPD and diabetes
  or preventing the 40 year old smoker with poor diet and exercise habits from turning
  into that 60 year old. Is the answer to that a $600 phone with an additional couple
  of hundred on additional devices? If you're really serious about this, focus on
  the lower end of the market - dumb phones, cheap smartphones. This has proved very
  profitable for [some](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/)
  and my contention is that because it was not focused just on one platform - Whatsapp
  is [available](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp) on \"*The client software
  is available for Google Android, BlackBerry OS, Apple iOS, selected Nokia Series
  40, Symbian, selected Nokia Asha platform, and BlackBerry 10.*\"\r\n\r\nSo, to answer
  the question I posed in the title, \"What does HealthKit mean for healthcare?\"
  - not much in the in the immediate term.\r\n"
