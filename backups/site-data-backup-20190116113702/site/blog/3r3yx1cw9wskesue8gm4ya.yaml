:post: "### UCSF Innovation Lab Tours\r\n\r\nThe two-day gathering began Thursday,
  June 18, with an extraordinary tour through three leading innovations centers at
  UCSF - The Gazzaley Lab, UCSF Human Performance Center at the Orthopedic Institute,
  and the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay. There we got to take an unparalleled
  glimpse into these state-of-the-art digital health facilities and witness their
  inner functionalities. Starting with the Human Performance Center, launched in 2014,
  we got to better understand how this innovative organization helps athletes better
  understand how they perform and what they can do to prevent and work around injuries
  while simultaneously optimizing efficiency. This lab is also a joint innovation
  UCSF has with Samsung, being the first-of-its-kind, where innovators and entrepreneurs
  can validate their technologies and accelerate the adoption of new preventative
  health solutions. Next up, The Gazzaley Lab, where we witnessed some of the latest
  and greatest happenings in modern cognitive neuroscience from the neural mechanics
  of memory to the possibilities of therapeutic intervention to alleviate cognitive
  deficits. And finally as the last stop on our tour, an up-close and personal look
  at the brand new UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay. When they say that this hospital
  was built with “a focus on the patient’s experience every step of the way, ” they
  weren’t kidding. Walk inside and you’ll find state-of-the-art, cutting-edge technology
  including personalized robotics and telemedicine that concurrently produces the
  highest merits of patient safety, energy efficiency, seismic readiness and environmental
  sustainability. \r\n\r\n### The Summit\r\n\r\nMoving on to the date of the Summit,
  Friday, June 19, hosted at the Mission Bay Conference Center, we got to start bright
  and early prepped and ready for a full day of innovative and inspiring sessions
  broken down into three parts - Growth in Innovation, Building Transformative Partnerships,
  and Winning Strategies Declassified. \r\n\r\n### Part One: Growth in Innovation\r\n\r\nStarting
  with Reed V. Tuckson MD, FACP, we got an eye-opening welcome into where the digital
  health industry currently stands and where it is predicted to go. Dr. Tuckson discusses
  this multi-billion dollar industry and how it is driving the development towards
  preventative healthcare and precision medicine. Also in this session, we got to
  hear what driving success factors are when it comes to startup funding from top-tier
  investors in the digital health arena. With such an intriguing and informative opening,
  we had to stick around for part two. \r\n\r\n### Part Two: Building Informative
  Partnerships\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a recurring theme throughout the conference
  that was addressed to be a key building block in the digital health industry - importance
  of partnerships. In part two, we got to hear how finding the right partnership to
  coincide with your company’s core needs to be held with the utmost tact and diplomacy.
  We got to hear from multiple sides and their insights, and among these presenters
  was Karan Singh, Co-Founder of [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io/), who has multiple
  affiliations, and among those, a partnership with UCSF where Ginger.io’s aggregator
  utilization dashboard processes are employed across multiple departments including
  orthopedic surgery. Ginger.io is at a cornerstone in digital health and pushing
  the needle forward towards preventative healthcare and precision medicine. We were
  humbled to hear their thoughts and take major considerations back with us when confronted
  with our own business development. \r\n\r\n### Part Three: Winning Strategies Declassified\r\n\r\nIn
  part three, our very own CEO and Co-Founder, Travis Good, got to speak on a panel
  alongside Molly Coye, MD, Former CIO of UCLA Health, and Adam Odessky, Co-Founder
  and CEO Sense.ly, Inc., in a session titled “Dealmaking, Piloting and Scaling: Do
  You Have What it Takes?” With the growing popularity in the digital health industry,
  many get lost in the endless pool of bureaucracy, so how do digital health companies
  execute lucratively into the healthcare systems? As Molly Coye states, as former
  CIO in healthcare, “the first thing we’re looking for is for someone to bring us
  a solution instead of merely describing the problem.” The panel goes on to speak
  on different entrepreneurial approaches, technical execution strategies, and scalability
  in healthcare products. These are all factors that play into wether survival in
  healthcare is apropos or inapposite to digital health.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it all,
  our minds were overloaded with context into our growing profession and popularity.
  The insights we gained will guide us to continue to better healthcare and how we
  should adjust and maneuver our approach. We were proud to be in attendance and a
  sponsor of such an incredible event and look forward to returning in years to come.
  A huge thank you to everyone who made the event possible. We are truly diffident
  by all that is happening but are filled with triumph and rejoice in seeing such
  a magnificent impact that we, as an industry, continue to make daily.\r\n\r\n"
