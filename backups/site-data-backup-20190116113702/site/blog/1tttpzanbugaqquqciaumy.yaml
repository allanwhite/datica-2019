:summary: HHS released its official Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing last month.
  The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask.
:blog_lead: |-
  HHS released it's official [Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing][1] last month. The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask. In some ways, it's HHS playing catchup to the industry. The cloud, while still early in terms of adoption in healthcare, is already heavily used for creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting ePHI. Look no further than [athenahealth][2], one of the largest EHR providers, for an example of a lot of ePHI in the cloud. Storing or moving data around different cloud-based services is becoming more and more commonplace.

  > A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity. - Dalai Lama

  Personally, I think HHS could and should play a more active and significant role in trends like cloud computing. I acknowledge it's hard to keep up with pace of technology in healthcare but there's still more HHS could do to engage with those leading these technical charges. That said, it's good to have official guidance from HHS.

  Yesterday I jointly conducted a webinar with [Coalfire][3]. Today I will recap some of the highlights, and pull out the salient points from the guidance and summarized them below. (_Note: CSP stands for cloud service provider._)

  * **Lacking encryption keys doesn't prevent you from being liable under HIPAA.** From the guidance, _This is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules._ This has been a claim by some CSPs and this is one of the most clear and relevant aspects of the HHS guidance. The claim by some CSPs is that, by not having the keys to decrypt ePHI, they are not a subcontractor or business associate. HHS says they are because they still store receive and maintain, even if that ePHI is encrypted and the CSP does not have the key to decrypt it. CSPs that fall into this bucket at considered _no-view services_ by HSS.
  * **But lacking keys does change obligations.** From the guidance, _In particular, where only the customer controls who is able to view the ePHI maintained by the CSP, certain access controls, such as authentication or unique user identification, may be the responsibility of the customer, while others, such as encryption, may be the responsibility of the CSP business associate._ This is the first I've seen HHS acknowledge—implicitly, at least—the concept of compliance inheritance for HIPAA. At Datica, we [pioneered][4] the concept of inheritance and still feel strongly that compliance inheritance is the best path to securing data, reducing risk of breach, and complying with HIPAA, in a cloud-based world.
  * **Lacking keys it could change breach reporting.** From the guidance, _If the ePHI that has been breached is encrypted consistent with the HIPAA standards set forth in 45 CFR § 164.402(2) and HHS' Guidance [13](#) the incident falls within the breach "safe harbor" and the CSP business associate is not required to report the incident to its customer._ This is significant as it changes breach reporting requirements for no-view CSPs, and breach reporting is a big part of HIPAA and a big part of what covered entities want to understand about their business associates and partners.
  * **All types of cloud configurations are ok for HIPAA.** From the guidance, _…while a covered entity or business associate may use cloud-based services of any configuration (public, hybrid, private, etc.), [3](#) provided it enters into a BAA with the CSP, the type of cloud configuration to be used may affect the risk analysis and risk management plans of all parties and the resultant provisions of the BAA._ NIST [defines][5] different cloud deployment models. The most common are public and private, or some mix of those two that NIST defines as hybrid. Organizations can comply with HIPAA using any deployment model but there are different risks associated with each and it is the job of the covered entity and business associate to properly assess the risk when selecting the proper deployment model. I would have preferred HHS go further and call out [single-tenant and multi-tenant in regards to HIPAA and cloud][6].
  * **SLAs need to align with BAAs.** From the guidance, _If a covered entity or business associate enters into a SLA with a CSP, it should ensure that the terms of the SLA are consistent with the BAA and the HIPAA Rules._ This is something that many business associates don't do but should. The core of this guidance is that the SLA from a CSP should ensure that access to ePHI is not restricted due to excessive downtime.
  * **Security and breach reporting should be very specifically defined.** From the guidance, _The Security Rule, however, is flexible and does not prescribe the level of detail, frequency, or format of reports of security incidents, which may be worked out between the parties to the business associate agreement (BAA)._ With ePHI moving between CSPs (think APIs and [Blank-as-a-Service][7]), it's imperative that each party knows what it is responsible for reporting. Reporting is essential to investigating and shutting off breaches.
  * **Cloud service providers do not need to store ePHI for some period of time.** From the guidance, _No, the HIPAA Rules generally do not require a business associate to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI) beyond the time it provides services to a covered entity or business associate._ This [not news][8] to us but it something that is frequently misunderstood about HIPAA so it's good that HHS called this out for CSPs.
  * **It's ok to use servers outside the USA.** From the guidance, _Yes, provided the covered entity (or business associate) enters into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the CSP and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules._ This surprised me a little. Not because I don't agree with HHS but because I have a hard time imagining the use case for this. We have global customers, particularly in the life sciences arena, who need global deployments. In those cases, we deploy separate apps and databases across different regions depending on where end users reside. All customers we have that work with US citizens are deployed in US data centers.
  * **Documentation of security practices is not required from cloud service providers.** From the guidance, _The HIPAA Rules do not expressly require that a CSP provide documentation of its security practices to or otherwise allow a customer to audit its security practices._ This type of documentation, while not required, may still be needed by covered entities and business associates based on the their determination of risk.

  ## What was not in the guidance?

  I think a few things were missing and that HHS didn't go far enough.

  1. **Define compliance inheritance.** I think HHS could go further here. HITRUST is a [good example][9] by incorporating the concept of inheritance into the CSF. Inheriting aspects of HIPAA is a core part of cloud deployments and should be addressed by HHS.
  2. **Address questions about multi-tenancy.** This is probably the most frequent question when it comes to ePHI + cloud. It would have been good to have official guidance as a part of the cloud guidance from HHS.
  3. **Start moving towards a universal, readable BAA.** The BAA [template][10] that HSS has on it's site, while useful in its generalizability, is too broad. There are things we know about the cloud and one of them, related to inheritance above, is that different parties can own different obligations. Creating a universal BAA, even if HHS is just the convener of industry leaders, would go a long way to helping healthcare move to the cloud in a safe way.

  Healthcare, and it's data and applications, are slowly but surely embracing the cloud. The recent guidance from HHS has gotten a lot of attention. Hopefully this summary was helpful. If you have any other questions, reach out to us at [hello@datica.com][11].

  :summary: Breaches and fines have been big news recently because a malicious hacker,
    or group of hackers, was able to gain access to health records.
  :blog_lead: |
    We've covered HIPAA from almost all angles, including interpretation and [enforcement](https://datica.com/academy/the-who-and-how-of-hipaa-enforcement/). When most people think about enforcement and HIPAA, they think about [breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/), fines, and potential jail time. All of those areas of enforcement are officially carried out by the [Office of Civil Rights](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/) (OCR), which is part of Health and Human Services (HHS). But that's not the practical side of enforcement for many of our customers.

    > > You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else. **- Albert Einstein**
  :post: |2+

    Breaches and fines have been big news recently. Community Health Systems (CHS) has been in the news  lately because a malicious hacker, or group of hackers, was able to gain access to health records for 5.4 million people (CHS is a large system). The current [speculation](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/08/18/cyber-attack-nets-4-5-million-records-from-large-hospital-system/) is that CHS could face fines up to $150 million levied by OCR. The cause of the CHS breach was a vulnerability in SSL discovered and made public over 4 months ago. CHS had not patched all of its servers. I assume CHS manages its own servers and likely has many, many applications; but, Heartbleed was a very public vulnerability and I'm surprised production systems were unpatched. At Datica we updated all of our systems the same day the vulnerability was discovered.

    Looking at the CHS case, it should be OCR that is investigating the cause of the breach and determining the financial penalties. For [covered entities](https://training.datica.com/#covered-entities) (CE), OCR enforces HIPAA. That's because covered entities are the ones that ultimately own the [ePHI](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/); we've [written](/blog/inheritance-and-ownership-of-compliance-risk/) about data ownership and inheritance of compliance from covered entities to business associates. And OCR [anticipates](http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/ocr-attorney-whopping-hipaa-fines-you-aint-seen-nothin-yet/2014-06-16) many more investigations and fines over the next 12 months. In addition to OCR, states are increasingly [cracking down](http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/privacy-mac-mcmillan-hipaa-ocr-hhs-healthcare-himss/2014-08-22?page=full) on health data privacy and security, complicating compliance for both covered entities and business associates. For the purpose of this post, our focus is more on OCR than states.

    While we have a few large CE customers like Blue Shield of California and the VA, the majority of our customers are business associates (BAs) and our customers customers are covered entities. Datica is a business associate or subcontractor, depending on our customers. [Business associates](/academy/hipaa-subcontractors-and-baas/) and subcontractors handle or process ePHI in some way for CEs or other BAs. While OCR investigates potential breaches of BAs, what you realize pretty quickly as a BA is that you have very little interactions with OCR and HHS in proving how you comply with HIPAA. As a BA, HIPAA is largely defined by covered entities that are your customers.

    We often help our customers when they get to the compliance and security point of selling to a large CE (hospital or payer typically). Our team has a lot of experience selling and managing contracts with large CEs. We still do work directly with large CEs today, and have even signed BAAs directly with CEs that are customers of our customers; this provides additional protection for our customers and transfers more of the compliance burden onto Datica. In our experience, we've seen the CEs interpret HIPAA rules for BAs. CEs put this interpretation onto BAs through [spreadsheets](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/ccm/), checklists, and long questionnaires on security, compliance, and privacy. It's interesting in that these security and privacy questions vary from CE to CE, though there is always some overlap (things like "When did you last test your disaster recover plan?" and "What form of encryption do you use for data at rest?").

    In these questions CEs are interpreting HIPAA for BAs. Many of our customers are more interested in closing contracts with CEs than completing full HIPAA audits, so CE interpretation trumps OCR interpretation much of the time. And there are things that CEs ask that aren't required by HIPAA, like stating 'all business associates need to have hardware firewalls'; we've seen this with several customers, and is the reason we host on AWS, Azure, Rackspace, and IBM SoftLayer.

    These CE security and compliance questions are typically part of the contracting process, or at the very least the implementation process. They can significantly slow the closing and sales process for BAs, especially smaller startups using modern, cloud-based technologies. At Datica, we offer both HIPAA compliant infrastructure and content (white papers, audit reports, policies, etc) that helps *our* customers show compliance to *their* customers. We also assist customers in completing these questionnaires and spreadsheets as well as joining phone calls with security and compliance officers for our customers.

  :summary: The cost of a HIPAA audit depends on audit type – HIPAA gap assessment,
    full HIPAA audit, or validated HITRUST assessment – and indirect costs like time.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > You must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. — Andrew Jackson

    At Datica we've been through [three external audits](https://datica.com/compliance/hitrust/) conducted by a large, national auditing firm. In all three cases, I've personally led the efforts from our side, coordinating our internal resources as needed. I wouldn't call it a fun process, but it has helped add rigor to our internal security and compliance programs. It validated the hard work we've done to build a fully [HIPAA compliant platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/), and associated organization, that exceeds the HIPAA rules. We've also learned what does and does not meet HIPAA standards from an external or auditor perspective.
  :post: "Cost seems to be one of a few gating factors for companies considering a
    HIPAA audit. It's certainly a topic we are asked about constantly. I touched on
    the cost of audits in my last post on [proving HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/).
    If you look at the cost of a HIPAA audit, it breaks into two broad categories.\n\n1.
    Direct costs\n2. Indirect costs.\n\nLet's walk through how costs are calculated
    in both.\n\n## Direct Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nThe easier bucket to calculate.
    It begins with the costs for an auditing firm to conduct the audit and deliver
    a report. Curiously, the auditor's charge is frequently used by most people use
    to calculate the overall cost of an audit, which is definitely not accurate. Different
    types of HIPAA audits exist. The costs are different for each. Datica has completed
    all of the audits below.\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment**. The best starting point.
    It is meant to identify gaps and remediation plans for those gaps. It's the cheapest
    option and least time consuming. It often does not require an onsite visit from
    an auditor. A gap assessment leads to a full HIPAA audit; after the gap assessment,
    organizations spend time addressing the gaps before beginning a full HIPAA audit.
    **The direct cost is about $15,000-$20,000.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit**. A full
    HIPAA audit, when applied to technology vendors, assesses an organization against
    all the [requirements in HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    It's a long list. It includes both technical settings and configurations as well
    as administrative requirements like training and business associate agreements.
    It will involve an auditor visit and will require documentation to support claims
    about security and compliance; this can include showing specific technology settings
    like password rules and guest access. **The direct cost is about $20,000-$25,000.**\n*
    **Validated HITRUST Assessment**. HITRUST is a more [complete, certifiable version
    of HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/). It was created by large healthcare
    enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but
    goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance
    programs. There's now a standard web app that you use to enter information. Those
    entries are then validated by HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization,
    reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you hopefully get
    HITRUST CSF Certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees
    to HITRUST and to your auditor (approved assessor). **The direct cost is about
    $30,000-$45,000** (cost can be much higher for larger organizations).\n\n## Indirect
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\n> It's really clear that the most precious resource
    we all have is time. - Steve Jobs\n\nIndirect costs are harder to quantify. The
    biggest factor to consider is time. For each of the types of audit above, the
    indirect costs increases as you move down the list. For each of our audits, we
    estimated the total time spent for all employees (we didn't break it out by each
    employee so it's not perfect).\n\n* **Gap Assessment: 40 hours.**\n* **Full HIPAA
    Audit: 100 hours.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment: 200 hours.**\n\nEqually
    hard to estimate was the time spent between each audit to address issues and \"harden\"
    our compliance and info sec programs. This time was not captured for any of the
    specific audits and contributes to the overall cost of compliance.\n\n## Total
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nWe conservatively estimated the cost of an hour of work
    to be $100/hour. This is partially loss for the cost of salaries + benefits and
    partially loss from opportunity cost of not doing other things with this time
    (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc). Based on those numbers,
    the total cost of the different audits are:\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment - $17,800-$22,800.**
    \n* **Full HIPAA Audit - $27,000-$32,000.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment
    - $44,000-$59,000.** \n\n## It's more than cost\n\nIf you are considering an audit,
    cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors
    that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For
    us, it was a nobrainer because our audits are part of our value proposition to
    customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having
    done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large
    deals.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply
    a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews,
    sort of like miniature audits. These too cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.
    We're working on calculating the overall cost of being [HIPAA compliant](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    so stay tuned for more soon. Also, if you have audit insights you can share, [we'd
    love to hear them](mailto:hello@datica.com).\n\n"

  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on

    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica.com/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica.com/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica.com/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
