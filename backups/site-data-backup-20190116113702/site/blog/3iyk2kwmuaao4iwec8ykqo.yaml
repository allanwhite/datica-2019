:summary: Esther Dyson, whose career includes journalist, author, businesswoman, commentator,
  philanthropist, angel investor, and even backup cosmonaut, sat down for an interview
  with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD.
:blog_lead: "This November, the [Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/podcast/)
  interviewed a very special industry guest. Due to audio difficulties, we chose to
  run a transcript of our fascinating conversation. \n\nEsther Dyson has worn many
  different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author, businesswoman,
  commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup cosmonaut. Esther
  sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In this interview, she
  shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital health success, the
  importance of security and privacy for digital health firms, and gave us an update
  on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American communities to use different
  measures to cultivate health and invest in the value wellness returns. "
:post: "> Don't be afraid to try. Work under the assumption that it will work and
  if it doesn't work, figure out why. In a startup you are doing things people have
  never done before.\" - Esther Dyson \n\n## Q & A with Travis Good and Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis
  Good, MD:** _Esther, you’ve said in the past that as an angel investor you like
  to focus your investments on disease prevention versus technology around disease
  treatment. Can you tell us a bit more about that philosophy?_\n\n**Esther Dyson:**
  In general, you get a better return on keeping things working and investing in capacity
  than you do in trying to repair things that are broken. To some extent, people sometimes
  take that for granted. They do general maintenance to their cars and they conduct
  home maintenance, but often forget when it comes to their own bodies. People generally
  don't go to the doctor until they are sick and by that time, it is extremely expensive
  to try and fix the problem. It's expensive not just for you, but also for the healthcare
  system. It’s also expensive for your employer and you are probably less productive
  there. For individual investors and for society in general, it makes more sense
  to keep us healthy. Obviously, a big market exists for fixing people who are broken,
  but given that I have limited resources, I'd rather try to put the people who are
  trying to “fix what is broken” out of business by keeping everybody healthy.\n\n>
  Let’s start with the simple proposition that health is an asset. It might be our
  most important asset. And like any asset, if we cultivate it we increase the value
  it returns. We’re not talking about fixes when health is broken; those are important
  but they happen too late.\n— [Way To WellVille](http://www.wellville.net/about-wellville/)\n\n**Travis:**
  _I would agree that obviously prevention is the ideal path so that makes sense from
  an investment standpoint, as well. I want to shift gears to something you founded
  in 2013. You rebranded the Health Initiative Coordinating Council (HICCup)._\n\n<img
  class=\"float-right\" title=\"Dyson - WaytoWellville-logo\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/KIxLr1iDGmiyYAi6cS4mG/d2080c6197ba94f2841c853c77015aac/Dyson_-_WaytoWellville-logo.png?w=400\"
  width=\"200\">\n\n**Esther:** In 2013, I founded Way to Wellville, which is a nonprofit
  and it does exactly what we are talking about. The investment pays off but the business
  model doesn't necessarily pay back to the investor, so that's why [Way to Wellville](http://hitconsultant.net/2015/02/12/esther-dysons-way-to-wellville-challenge/)
  is a nonprofit. We are trying to show the value of investing in health. Ultimately,
  governments, communities, and employers will realize there's a huge ROI. In 2014,
  we selected five communities from among 42 that applied. Now, the Wellville team
  of five are working with actual communities to help make them healthy. By the end
  of ten years, we hope to have enough success and visibility that we actually persuade
  other people to follow our path.\n\n> These are all real places with real people.
  They are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just places that have
  decided they would like a better future for their residents. [Wellville is] helping
  them build that for themselves.\n\n**Travis:** _My understanding is that the goal
  with these communities is to see which one could most improve five measures of health
  and economic vitality over a five year period. That was 2014; we are almost in 2018
  now. Could you update us on how that's going?_\n\n**Esther:** As I mentioned, we
  pivoted. It did start out as a contest, but it turned out the communities were not
  interested in beating one another, they really wanted to collaborate and learn from
  one another. It also became clear that ten years is a more realistic timeframe.
  Like any startup, we've morphed. It turns out that getting communities and community
  leader groups coordinated and organized has a long gestation period. It's very much
  like a startup; it takes a few years to build your team, try out an NVP, then discover
  that you need to change everything. We are now much more focused on children and
  parents and prevention of diabetes. If you can help the parents be better parents,
  or you change the children's experience positively, that's what's going to pay off
  best in the long run. \n\nDiscussions now center on [the opioid crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/truth-us-opioid-crisis-too-easy-blame-doctors-not-prescriptions);
  they keep talking about the drugs, but they should also be talking about why people
  are so vulnerable to these drugs. What makes them unable to resist? Not everybody
  who takes an opioid suddenly gets addicted, yet a number of people do and that's
  partly because their childhood was so insecure. It’s very hard if you've grown up
  not being able to trust the people around you. There's a lot of data on so-called
  adverse childhood experience that show direct correlation between that and addiction,
  unemployment, crime and all kinds of social ills. So we are trying to go upstream
  and address it from the start. \n\n**Travis:** _Are you working with the communities
  to define those measures and strategies, or are they coming to you?_\n\n**Esther:**
  We put out a call for applications in 2014. Forty-two communities applied; we picked
  five. Our role is like a personal trainer, or perhaps a startup coach. It's still
  the community that has to do the work; it’s their people; it's ultimately their
  achievement. We might eventually make ourselves unnecessary, but in the meantime,
  we can give them advice, introduce them to what the other communities are doing,
  introduce them to vendors and to potential funding sources. Way to Wellness was
  funded by me and I'd certainly love others to join, but the community projects are
  funded directly by funders, whether it is Medicaid, or philanthropy or a government
  grant; it's between those funders and the communities. It's theirs, not ours and
  we are not looking to be visible or recognized. We are looking for them to take
  on the responsibility, do the work, make a difference, train their own people and
  have something to be really proud of.\n\n**Travis:** _It's exciting to hear when
  people are working with communities, especially some small communities. What happens
  after that initial 10-year period?_\n\n**Esther:** The goal is to build something
  sustainable. Instead of, “Oh we have a class for 60 overweight women.” We want to
  hear, “We have now trained 30 dieticians and nutritional counselors, exercise coaches
  and they are community members, and they now have jobs and they are keeping those
  people healthy.”  This is the problem: Just as people get addicted to drugs, ironically,
  communities and nonprofits often get addicted to pilots. The pilots are great. We
  often hear, \"This pilot’s going to be really wonderful and we'll have a trial with
  30 people.” The pilot works then we often hear \"We've run out of funding and the
  funders want to do something more innovative.\" We are not trying to do something
  innovative; we are trying to do something that works and then scale it. \n\nWhen
  Walmart opens a store, they are not running a pilot to see if the store works. If
  the store somehow isn't working, they find a new manager, they do more training,
  but they don't say, \"Oh, the concept of this really doesn't work.\" We are trying
  to get that kind of accountability. These programs work, if effective people are
  brought in, screened and trained. People need transportation, as well. There are
  lots of local challenges that you need to overcome. There's no magic here; there's
  simply implementation, persistence, and being in it for the long-term, versus \"we'll
  get some results and then see what happens.\" \n\n**Travis:** _As you were talking
  through that in terms of building something that is sustainable, real, and can scale,
  I imagine that's the same thing you would say to some of the companies that you
  invest in and how they should view pilots._\n\n**Esther:** Yes, very much. Don't
  be afraid to try. Work under the assumption that it will work and if it doesn't
  work, figure out why. In a startup you are doing things people have never done before.
  People have done diabetes prevention programs before. They have trained communities
  better. What we are not doing is coming to these communities and doing exotic research
  and turning people into specimens. We are helping them do things that typically
  don't scale. Instead of doing something that is often different, you are trying
  to do something new that hasn't been tried before and learn from failing. In our
  communities, you learn from failing. Maybe we need to train people better or maybe
  we didn't market this program effectively enough or we need to provide some type
  of incentive or we need to provide child care so that people can attend the course,
  because hey, they don't have childcare — what a surprise! It's those kinds of things.\n\n>
  It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need to make their data
  usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't understand that they
  need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals. Many companies think
  they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how to actually get it installed
  and working in the actual healthcare environment.\" -Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis:**
  _I want to shift gears a little and talk about one of the company that you are invested
  in, I read something about a merger between Digi.me and Personal. In terms of joining
  forces, they are looking to address the challenges around enhancing privacy with
  healthcare data. But at the same time, enabling people to share and potentially
  combine and analyze data. As you think about your investment there, can you share
  your thoughts on the importance that must be made by healthcare IT companies on
  privacy and security?_\n\n**Esther:** Privacy and security are really important
  but to some extent, there are regular privacy breaches, which is an issue to fix.
  Privacy and [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) often obstruct
  good healthcare. What you need for good healthcare is to know more about the person,
  not just their result on a particular test. Where do they live? What is their income
  level? In case of opioids, have they applied for drugs at any other place? Do they
  have multiple sources of supply? It’s not a complicated thing, it's having both
  security, privacy and effective data sharing. That's what is challenging. It's very
  easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need to make their data usable.
  Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't understand that they need to
  train users and understand the workflow in hospitals. Many companies think they
  have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how to actually get it installed
  and working in the actual healthcare environment. \n\n**Travis:** _How do you advise
  companies to help them navigate that path towards implementing the solution and
  into the workflow of the health system?_\n\n**Esther:** I'm generally pretty skeptical.
  I was just at the doctor earlier this week and had blood tests. I got the tests
  back and they were in a PDF. What I'd really like to see is my FitBit data and other
  personal data, to determine how the blood tests changed over time. What I had was
  a long list of PDFs from various dates that were completely useless. Part of the
  problem is that most of these institutions are using large legacy mainframe systems
  that are incredibly cumbersome. You really start to think: \"Throw this all out
  and start fresh.\" That's what a number of vendors are doing but of course, it is
  very hard to replace the huge installs of these systems. \n\nI'm on the board of
  a company called Wellpass, and invested in quite a few others, including 4D Healthware,
  Healthcelerate, [HealthLoop](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/healthloop/), Vital Score.
  They all sell into healthcare systems, and need to understand how they work. I don't
  think a twenty-two year old who just graduated from Stanford can know how to fix
  the healthcare system. You need to have someone that has actually worked in a hospital
  or an insurance company on your team. That's not just so you have contacts, but
  more importantly so that you understand the context, how the system works, how the
  data actually flows. I went to a continuing medical education conference once; they
  had this table where they were handing out medical advice for doctors. There was
  a stack of stapled handouts — twenty-five sheets each, double-sided, so fifty pages
  per handout. Each page was a spreadsheet about some particular thing the doctor
  should do with their patient during the patient interview — which of course lasts
  max fifteen minutes. As a doctor, they are probably spending eight or nine minutes
  typing and and five minutes actually talking. Now here’s this sheet of fifty things
  they are supposed to be doing; some of them they’re already doing, and some are
  only for teenagers and or for women. But you, as a vendor, you have to understand
  that you are either replacing one of those fifty things, or adding to them. Do you
  really understand that context? Can you fit into it or make it better with your
  extra page? Of course, some things are for the administrator, or the nurse discharging
  patients. But whatever your tool does, how does it make those people’s lives better
  and easier? \n\nThat's the challenge. Healthcare is a very cumbersome and change-resistant
  marketplace. The companies that have been the most successful are the ones that
  are eroding things around the edges. I love this marketplace because it is interesting
  and important but, if you want to be in this marketplace, you need to understand
  the challenges.\n\n**Travis:** _As we think of how to augment, expand, extend, or
  in some way work with the EHR and EHR data — taking that data and transform it into
  something a bit more meaningful than a CCD or some big PDF — I'm curious what you
  are finding there._\n\n**Esther:** One company out there called PicnicHealth will
  take your medical records and automatically parse them as much as they can and then
  have humans do the rest. They will have people on the phone calling to get your
  medical documents from all these different vendors or different providers and they
  will make them all into one piece that is intelligible. That is really an exciting
  proposition. As I was just talking about my blood draws, I realized I should just
  call them up and see how they are doing and use the service. \n\nThe challenge,
  of course, is that there are so many different varieties and layouts. There is an
  accepted medical vocabulary but there are always little exceptions here and there.
  A blood value is not something you want to get wrong. For the patient, but also
  for the doctor, you want to make sure that if you are comparing data from multiple
  sources, you want to make sure the data is absolutely consistent across all these
  different sources. It's a challenge and there is both a real danger to people and
  real liability to companies if they do it wrong. So, it's going to be a slow process.
  The more standardized things get, the better. Whether you are on a Mac or a PC,
  we can amazingly have this conversation, across different kinds of computers and
  it is working, more or less. \n\n**Travis:** _It is interesting to see how different
  companies are approaching that challenge, both from a consumer standpoint and from
  FHIR and direct-to-consumer enablement authorization of data._\n\n**Esther:** At
  one end, somebody like [Apple and HealthKit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-healthcare/)
  is really fostering that. It’s possible; consider how it happened in banking, with
  Intuit. They had this tool Quicken that would let individual bank customers interact
  with their bank portals. Intuit started by reverse-engineering the interfaces of
  a couple of big banks - probably Citibank and BankAmerica (I’m not sure) - so users
  of those banks could download their own data and manage it for themselves, even
  consolidating data from multiple accounts. At first, the banks were very resistant
  but after the first two or three were done, and the customers started engaging more
  with their banks, the other banks noticed. They started saying, \"Wow, they are
  not losing their customers; in fact, those banks are getting even more buy-in from
  their customers. We want this, too.\" They went to Intuit and said, \"Please do
  an API [application program interface] for us.” Suddenly the dynamics had changed.
  Intuit came back and said, “If you want to hook up your banks to us, then you have
  to do the work, but sure, we'd be glad to let you address our customer base.” With
  luck, that's what's going to happen in healthcare. There are going to be a lot of
  vendors now that are interested in working with HealthKit and other intermediaries.
  You are beginning to get this widespread recognition that, of course, individuals
  should be able to see their Fitbit data matched against their RunKeeper data and
  someday matched against blood draws and all the other stuff.\n\n**Travis:** _I want
  to follow up on something else you said. There's been a ton of investment in the
  digital healthcare space over the last five to ten years. You mentioned about having
  someone with experience on the actual care side. Can you share two or three consistent
  success threads that help take a startup from a seed investment up through multiple
  series, from A to B to C?_\n\n**Esther:** Basically it all comes down to the team.
  You need to know something; you need to work together effectively; but then you
  need to be willing to learn and change into it; be agile and be humble and all this
  kind stuff. It's really the attitude of “I love what I'm doing, I'm learning from
  what I'm doing and I'm responding to what I'm learning.” Then, it helps if you have
  a good idea and you are working with interesting problems. There are lots of specifics
  to health or healthcare but the fundamental things that make startups successful
  are pretty much the same. \n\n**Travis:** _Curious on team, and investing in team,
  as you look at presentations and pitch decks, do you have an opinion on an ideal
  team or an ideal mix of people on a team that you like to see and you like to invest
  in._\n\n**Esther:** Very clearly, it doesn't consist of the three best people in
  the world, it consists of the best team of three or four, or whatever. A lot of
  people miss one out of the three or four, but you need someone with medical industry
  knowledge and connections; you need someone with technical capacity to build what
  you need; you need someone who understands, whether it is the consumer or the healthcare
  system that you are selling into; but, you also need someone who understands the
  user proposition, especially in healthcare where often the payer is not the same
  as the user. The payer may be the insurance company or the individual, but it may
  be that the payer is the hospital, but the user is a doctor or a nurse. \n\nIt goes
  back to the old software industry, where there was this wonderful set of companies
  called value-added resellers (VARs). They would take the product and go find a corporate
  customer. They would train the IT department and help IT install the software. Then
  they would train the users — the employees making phone calls or doing accounting
  or customer support. The VARs understood it was their problem to make the buyers
  — and the buyers’ employees — like the product. Without VARs, the software vendors'
  customers would usually pilot the software and think it was great, but then they
  would buy it and find out they couldn't get their employees to use it. The vendor
  got the money the first few times and started getting bad references for the product.\n\nI
  think we need a better understanding of the role of VARs (or whatever you want to
  call them these days) in the healthcare market. Whether it’s a third-party VAR or
  your own sales support, you need someone who understands how the hospital works,
  or how the insurance company works to insert their product into the workflow and
  actually make it useful and make the end-user customer say, \"Oh my gosh, this makes
  my job so much easier. I can do referrals automatically instead of having to handwrite
  something on a piece of paper and give it to my nurse and she puts it on my desk
  and it gets lost and I don't get the referral back and forth with the other doctors.\"
  And, of course, the patient doesn't get the benefit of going to see the dermatologist.\n\n**Travis:**
  _Before we conclude the interview, Esther, I wanted to ensure we covered everything
  on the Way to Wellville so that we didn’t miss anything there._\n\n**Esther:** Well,
  I did want to mention [the five Wellville communities](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/),
  just in case in case anybody listening either lives in one of them or is nearby.
  The Wellville partner in Muskegon County, Michigan, which is the one that I work
  with most closely, is called [1 in 21](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/muskegon-michigan/).
  The Wellville partner in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is called [Spartanburg’s Way
  to Wellville](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/spartanburg-south-carolina/).
  There's [Hope Rising](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/lake-county-california/)
  in Lake County, California, which is just north of Silicon Valley. There's [Way
  to Wellville: Clatsop County](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/clatsop-county-oregon/),
  northwest of Portland, Oregon. And there's the [Triple Aim Collaborative](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/north-hartford-connecticut/)
  in North Hartford, Connecticut. These are all real places with real people. They
  are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just places that have decided
  they would like a better future for their residents. We are helping them build that
  for themselves. You can find us at [wellville.net](http://www.wellville.net).\n\n**Travis:**
  _Wonderful. Thank you for joining us today, Esther._\n\n**Esther:** Likewise, it
  was great. Thank you very much. \n\n<div class=\"callout callout--gray-light lead\"

  :summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive
    suite. Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health
    Resources.
  :blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
    but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
    from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the
    Chief Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description
    that's evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
  :post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All
    the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things
    that the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017,
    healthcare organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies
    around MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about
    [the evolving role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical
    Information Officer, and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas
    Health Resources, one of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery
    systems in the United States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt
    Texas Health Resources (THR), the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason
    many hospitals added a CMIO in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide
    push toward electronic health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation
    project was a huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction
    rating and its [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was
    the initial reason the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve
    the job definition of a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes
    far beyond EHR. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians,
    are things that the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:**
    Listen to the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the
    CMIO job is like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources
    has implemented the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved
    past stabilization, through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into
    the thick of the volume-based to value-based care transformation broadly taking
    place today. The CMIO's role is shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe
    roadmap going forward is driven by three major things: healthcare regulation,
    defining success as a healthcare organization, and effectively engaging physicians
    in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization is about improving the workflows,\"
    Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling up your sleeves and digging into specific
    and individual workflows and really optimizing those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively,
    THR has found the need to continually engage physicians in the optimization process.
    \"That entails workflow mapping and going back and redesigning care or redesigning
    the workflow, then doing some usability testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing
    that again. In fact, optimization is always a reimplementation of certain workflows,
    so you are just digging in a little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes
    a village\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability
    to collaborate with many different people, both inside and outside the organization.
    Dr. Saldana relies on a network of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how
    others solve similar problems. \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS,
    CHIME, or other forums to really connect with the people that I know are leaders
    in different areas.\" He also relies on industry organizations, like the American
    Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]), to get ideas and answers. I think
    it is important for a CMIO to get out there and not just stay cloistered within
    healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana added.\n\n## Bringing 2017
    into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in healthcare today and CMIOs
    are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for some of the newer technologies
    around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled payments and new digital health
    solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the platform that engages our patients
    and our providers and delivers the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal,\"
    said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about
    as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as they did with Meaningful Use, THR is
    planning to create a steering committee with multi-area representatives from both
    the technology and clinical sides of the fence. Dr. Saldana has this to say about
    MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for [MACRA][7].
    It's going to be how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.\"\n*
    **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare organizations today, minimizing
    risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New EMR workflows for patient
    engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary to provide patients
    with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part of improving value
    is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr. Saldana said, \"The
    point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can have an impact. Ordering
    for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will be critical for us
    as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n* **Investigating
    cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is looking into are
    in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n##
    Staying focused through it all – putting physicians first\n\nAfter spending thirty
    years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves as a representative voice
    of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency physicians get into informatics
    since there are a lot of parallels with emergency medicine and informatics in
    terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be avoided by having someone
    like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians. Dr. Saldana says a big
    part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the eyes of a physician,
    looking specifically at whether or not that new technology will make them more
    efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness to take on the
    burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the bridge between
    the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that
    we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.
    Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important for a CMIO.
    Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for an
    organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores innovation

  :summary: Our Healthcare Innovators podcast continues with an illuminative interview
    with Aaron Neinstein, MD on tech that tames the deluge of patient generated data.
  :blog_lead: We continue our conversations on the subject of healthcare innovation
    with an illuminative podcast interview with Aaron Neinstein, MD. [UCSF’s Dr. Neinstein](https://aaronneinstein.com/)
    gives us a view into some of the promising technologies emerging to organize,
    digest, and analyze the massive amounts of patient-generated data we are quickly
    becoming inundated with. Neinstein also shares his ideas about what we can expect
    to see in the near future, as clinicians gain access to this data.
  :post: "\nHere are a just few of the many ideas you’ll hear in Datica’s Healthcare
    Innovators Series Podcast, [“Emerging Healthcare Data Challenges from Patient
    Centric Technologies.”](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/aaron-neinstein-md-emerging-healthcare-data-challenges-from-patient-centric-technologies/)\n\n-
    **On openness to patient generated data:** “A big thing is more incentives from
    the payors, so over the last two years, we've seen the introduction of the Medicare
    chronic care management codes which create the payment opportunity for use of
    patient-generated health data. What those codes do is allow you to bill on on
    a monthly ongoing basis for taking care of a patient who has two or more chronic
    diseases. You could theoretically have a nurse or someone else on your staff managing
    the patient remotely and be billing for that time.”\n\n- **On other disease communities
    using diabetes as a model for technology and tech services:** “One place in particular
    where we are seeing similarities to diabetes is with asthma. If you think about
    capturing the action and activity that a patient takes in the normal course of
    the day. That's what we are talking about here; these are chronic diseases, where
    coming in for an office visit three or four times a year allows a narrow snapshot
    of what's happening in somebody's life. The reason we care about patient-generated
    health data is in theory because it gives us the opportunity to see what somebody
    is doing day-to-day, 24/7, 365 in the context of their life, and tweak their treatment
    regimen or change their behavior to improve the management of their chronic disease.”\n\n-
    **On how EHRs fit into the future of patient-generated data:** “I think one of
    the things that people don't think about is how many different categories of patient-generated
    health data there actually are. If you break it down, you are talking about 7
    or 8 categories of things that comprise what we now called PGHD.”\n\nSubscribe

  :summary: Dr. Naomi Fried shared her ideas on the differences in innovation between
    pharma and hospitals, and opportunities for digital health vendors in pharma.
  :blog_lead: "Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare
    innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most
    recently, as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External
    Partnerships, she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients
    and healthcare professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation
    beyond the molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients
    and providers. \n\nIn our [July, 2017 podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/naomi-fried-how-digital-health-companies-can-help-pharma-innovate/)
    Travis Good, MD interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences
    between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages
    digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways
    from the podcast. "
  :post: "\n> A whole world of opportunity exists for startups to bring new digital
    ideas into the market. Digital health vendors should be seeking out pharma for
    expertise and advice and working with providers to get to patient populations
    and to bring these new ideas forward to us. - Dr. Naomi Fried, Founder and CEO,
    [Health Innovation Strategies](http://www.healthinnovationstrategies.com/)\n\n##
    Pharma companies are slower to innovate than hospitals \n\nInnovation centers
    are prevalent throughout today’s healthcare ecosystem. But when innovation at
    Pharma companies is compared to innovation at hospitals and large health systems,
    hospitals cross the finish line first. “When it comes to testing and implementing
    patient-facing innovations, particularly new digital health tools, I think providers
    generally move more quickly,” says Fried. “They are closer to the patient, with
    fewer regulatory barriers to navigate around. So they tend to be more likely to
    jump in and try things. I’d say when it comes to [digital health innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/)
    for patients, hospitals are probably actually a bit ahead of pharma.”\n\n## Digital
    health vendors and pharma should partner\n\nInnovation in the pharmaceutical industry
    is fueled by both internal development and the external development taking place
    in digital health startups across the globe. The fastest path to innovation is
    in the partnerships being developed between the two. “Digital health companies
    usually have specialized domain knowledge,” Fried comments. “Tech-savvy, entrepreneurial
    startups tend to have a consumer bent and are better at developing user experiences
    and consumer-oriented solutions than large pharma companies.”\n\n> Digital health
    startups generally move more quickly and often develop products in months rather
    than years, and they can also make changes quickly and respond to feedback they
    get.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, pharma companies can help [digital health
    vendors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/) get past some of the healthcare-specific hurdles
    to get their products to market faster. Fried explains, “Digital health startups
    can leverage and learn from pharma's well-established processes around healthcare
    industry-specific details. Those include things like CPT coding and thinking about
    payer reimbursement. They don't have to reinvent the wheel or invest heavily in
    developing regulatory expertise but really can look to a pharma partner who can
    help them leapfrog to where they are going.”\n\n“Where startups lack the infrastructure
    needed to reach customers and have trouble scaling up, this is something that
    pharmaceutical companies have done well. So I think that teaming up with pharmaceutical
    companies and tapping their extensive marketing infrastructures and distribution
    channels can really help digital startups get traction, much faster than they
    could if they were on their own.”\n\n## The three biggest opportunities for digital
    health products\n\nDr. Fried describes three areas within digital health patient
    care that improve value and have the potential to reduce costs.\n\n### 1. Medication
    adherence\n\nMedication adherence has a big effect on outcomes and is supported
    and driven by digital tools. “When patients are more compliant in taking their
    medications, the stakeholders — doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and payers
    — all benefit. I think medication adherence is one of the Holy Grails in healthcare.
    Getting patients to take their medications at the right time, with the right dosage
    for a condition can really save costs and improve patient outcomes,” explains
    Fried.\n\n### 2. Digital diagnosis and prediction\n\nA cost savings to the system
    and better outcomes for the patients make diagnosis and prediction technology
    a winning opportunity for digital health vendors to explore.  Fried explains by
    example, “Prophylactically taking medication that will avoid an asthma attack
    may mean a patient takes more drugs at a certain time. But the net result is a
    lower cost for the overall episode or even no episode at all, avoiding expenses
    like a trip to the emergency department.”\n\n### 3. Digiceuticals\n\nThese are
    digital therapies that treat a patient for a condition in addition to, or instead
    of, a traditional pharmaceutical solution. Fried says, “They can either be complementary
    to medication or they may even have the potential to substitute for medication.
    An example of a complementary digiceutical would be a pain management app that
    goes along with pain medication that a patient might take after surgery. This
    could result in the patient needing less medication or healing more quickly. An
    example of a substitute digiceutical is a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD). Kids could use these apps rather than taking a medication.”\n\n>
    I think digiceuticals will clearly drive improved outcomes and lower the cost
    of healthcare with digital health solutions that bring value in addition to medication.
    I think that the complementary and synergistic effects of digital health with
    medications are a net-win for patients, for pharma, and also for the payers.\n\nTune

    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
