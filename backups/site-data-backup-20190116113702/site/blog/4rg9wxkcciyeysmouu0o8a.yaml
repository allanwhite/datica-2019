:summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
  policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
:blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A LOT
  of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're focused
  on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't reaching when
  we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*, referring to
  HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
  That translates to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies
  and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA.
:post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
  along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
  Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party auditor.
  The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge that our
  customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
  class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
  src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
  width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
  truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more about
  HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our compliance
  work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures are written,
  reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are reviewed, using
  a similar pull request process that we use for our code review, as well as by external
  auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica. Below are some high level
  things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis, and policies below, are
  the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built from the ground up to be
  secure and expose data only when access is specifically granted, never by default.
  Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when you are trying to build a flexible
  cloud platform for developers but we think we've accomplished combining simplicity,
  security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part of Datica’s risk management program, we review
  the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure, Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services
  that involve ePHI. In turn, our customers should evaluate us as part of their program
  by reviewing Datica's compliance documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports.
  These reports confirm our risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management
  section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy) of our compliance
  policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things we do to maintain
  the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we make it a point to
  [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our customers and the
  cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies, we have a lot
  of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much time developing
  and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000 words worth of policies,
  including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
  of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control. Our
  [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that others
  can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
  are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that are
  required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define specifically
  how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially when
  it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much all
  everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into place
  but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile within
  a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly tied
  to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that we do.
  As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
  you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
  This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
  rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
  to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
  audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies and
  procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that all
  workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
  at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for covered
  entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with patients.
  We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own [HIPAA introductory
  training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees at Datica complete this
  training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover topics related to security,
  privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica team members.\n\n## BAAs for
  new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready access to any ePHI, but we do
  store sensitive information and support our customers with their applications. As
  such, we made the decision early on to either own and manage systems that store
  sensitive information or work with companies that will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe
  took all of these steps, dedication all of these resources, and spent all of these
  resources because operating as a business associate, with all organization and admin
  requirements met, sets us apart from everybody else in the compliant infrastructure
  business. We don't just sign business associate agreements (BAAs) and secure our
  infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full extent of the rules. It gives us
  additional insight into our customers' needs and keeps us intimately close to the
  problem we are solving. It is also extremely valuable to our customers when they
  work with compliance offices and point to our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen
  you decide to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant
  cloud, we encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the
  offerings and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and
  which are really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
  If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
  and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
  about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica.com/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica.com/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica.com/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica.com/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

  :summary: The biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply
    the complexity of understanding everything. This new compliance self-assessment
    worksheet will help.
  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on
    the cloud. Sometimes it''s simple, like how long to retain PHI data for disaster
    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,
    like if the emergent serverless computing paradigm meets the requirements of global
    compliance regimes (answer: it depends, but pull up a chair).'
  :post: |2

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
