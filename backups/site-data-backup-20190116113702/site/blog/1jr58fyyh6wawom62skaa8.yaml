  [Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/) helps case managers stay more engaged with patients with chronic diseases. They started with diabetes but are moving into COPD, hypertension, and congestive heart failure soon.

  We think they are a good example of the ground swell of new, smarter tools addressing high-risk, expensive cost centers in healthcare. Collectively, products and services like Welkin will help healthcare be both more efficient _and_ more effective. Datica is happy to be a partner and help their cause.

  Congrats Welkin on the fund raise!
