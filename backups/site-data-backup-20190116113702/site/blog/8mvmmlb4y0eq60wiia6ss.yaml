  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Health—The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,
    among others. His expertise on compliance, HIPAA, and health IT is highly regarded
    and sought after. He recently released his first book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). "

  ### Where are we today?
  Healthcare is in the midst of a paradigm shift. Our system has evolved to a point where it is not sustainable. People, both in the general public and amongst elected officials, have now concluded we don’t get substantial returns on our healthcare spending. The general sentiment is that our system is too expensive and spending is not tied to the value of care delivered or to the outcomes of care delivered. Those are both very fair conclusions.
:post: "Our current system is built with providers at the center of care and payers
  as the financial instrument obscuring the cost of healthcare from both providers
  and patients. Because providers are at the center of care, care is delivered sporadically
  in episodes when patients are sitting in front of providers - in an office, ER,
  hospital room, etc.\r\n\r\n### How did we get here?\r\n\r\nWe evolved to our current
  predicament from a time when hospitals just collected what they billed for care.
  Then came DRGs and CPTs to level the playing field for care for each condition or
  encounter. Because payment for healthcare hasn’t been tied to efficiency for or
  collaboration around care, there has been very little incentive to accurately and
  completely document healthcare data and share it with other providers. For most
  of healthcare delivery, the main motivation in documenting care has been to bill
  more completely for certain CPTs and DRGs. In recent years, the main driver of digital
  care documentation has been HITECH and Meaningful Use.\r\n\r\n### Where do we need
  to get to in 5 years?\r\n\r\nObviously, healthcare needs to change and the systems,
  processes, and tools just are not in place to make that change. Over the next five
  years, the healthcare delivery system has to broadly shift from being paid for delivering
  more care to being paid to deliver better care. The current en vogue terminology
  is that the system is shifting from volume-based care delivery to value-based care
  delivery. Better care, in the definition of the triple aim, means better clinical
  outcomes, lower overall costs, and a better experience for patients accessing care.\r\n\r\nThe
  shift to better care mandates several broad brush changes:\r\n\r\n1. New partnerships
  between healthcare providers and payers;\r\n2. New partnerships between healthcare
  providers and healthcare providers;\r\n3. New partnerships between healthcare providers
  and community anchors;\r\n4. New level of collaboration between different kinds
  of providers (MDs, nutritionists, care navigators, etc), especially in ambulatory
  and primary care settings;\r\n5. Informed and engaged patients that **can**, if
  they choose, play an active role in their care;\r\n6. Care delivered in locations
  that are the least expensive (sometimes virtual, through consumer devices, or in
  retail locations).\r\n\r\nAs you can see from those shifts, there is a significant
  need for tools that improve communication and data exchange, something that has
  not been a focus in healthcare.\r\n\r\n### What will healthcare look like then?\r\n\r\nThe
  end-result, which is going to take longer than five years, is a health system centered
  on patients and not healthcare providers or payers. Patients will be at the center
  of care but will **not** be accountable for the majority of healthcare costs. The
  health delivery organizations will take on more risk, therefore “owning” patients
  when it comes to payment and risk; on the flip side, patients will have much more
  say in their care. In addition to shifting care by putting patients at the center,
  care will be more of a team effort between different types of providers.\r\n\r\nThese
  shifts require two things (and here is the exciting news for those interested in
  digital health):\r\n\r\n1. More data about patients, not just episodic data; and\r\n2.
  Better data flow between systems to improve team-based care and patient access to
  data.\r\n\r\nAs Bob Wachter, MD, mentioned in our soon-to-be published [Innovation
  Series](https://catalyze.io/innovation) Interview, the shift from volume-based care
  to value-based care will eventually enable the full digitization of healthcare.
  With the digitization of healthcare, the secondary benefits of EHRs will be realized
  and new digital health services will emerge that can radically shift the way we
  view health and healthcare.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/catalyzeio)
