:summary: 'Security by design is upfront and well-documented in how things are made
  secure, relying on a proactive approach to security and patching as well as risk
  mitigation. '
:blog_lead: 'There''s a principle in engineering called security through obscurity,
  which is in contrast to security by design. Security by design is how we build technology
  at Datica. Security through obscurity takes the premise that if you don''t provide
  any information and you essentially keep the way that you do security, and the types
  of systems that you use, a secret, then people are less likely to find vulnerabilities
  and ultimately compromise your systems.

:post: |+
  There are theoretical reasons for this approach. A lot of the time, one of the first steps that a malicious attacker will take would be going through the process of network and information discovery. Learning the types of network that you're using, network technologies that you're running, ports that you have opened, operating system versions, application and database server types, all of these various pieces of your technology, is the first step for most malicious hackers. Security by obscurity relies on people not discovering the types of things you're running in your environment.

  This is in contrast to security by design, which is very upfront and well-documented in how things are made secure, relying on a proactive approach to security and patching as well as risk mitigation. Security through obscurity is not commonly accepted as a best practice in the industry. NIST specifically speaks against security through obscurity as not an effective way to do information security, or create information security program for an organization.

  Applying those same principles to compliance, and doing so while examining the current compliant hosting market, yields interesting results. Compliance through obscurity is something that we see pretty prevalent in the industry today - specifically in the health care industry today. We see many cloud vendors that aren't upfront and don't publicly publish their policies. These compliant vendors don't publish their business associate agreements, and they are not upfront about the way that they manage compliance or map to compliance frameworks like HIPAA. What that lack of transparency does in compliance is even worse than what it does in security through obscurity.

  With HIPAA, there's a lot of confusion already in the market. With modern [cloud-based technologies](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/), APIs, business associates, and now sub-contractors, there are multiple layers of compliance, and there is inheritance of different aspects of HIPAA compliance. Not having transparency in compliance, and mappings to the different requirements that exist within HIPAA, creates confusion about responsibilities and obligations. In the market today it is very unclear who is financially liable for which security controls and mitigations, as well as who is obligated between the different layers of vendors touching ePHI.

  Ultimately, this confusion creates a knee-jerk reaction from the large, established players in the industry, the health care systems and insurers - as they consider moving some of their technologies to a cloud-based environment, or working with vendors that utilize cloud-based technologies. Larger enterprises are more risk averse, rightfully so as they have a lot more at stake with potential breaches. It's harder for large players to move to the cloud because cloud-based offerings are not transparent and it's hard to understand who is meeting each of the various obligations that exist within HIPPA. Questions like who's managing disaster-recovery? Who's doing logging and back-up? Who's managing encryption at rest? Those specific things are different across all the various hosting options.

  None of the hosting providers open up their policies, and many don't open up their business associate agreements - heck, some require NDAs before [signing BAAs](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/). That serves to create additional confusion, and ultimately lead to solutions that incorporate business associates and subcontractors for things like hosting, that aren't meeting all the requirements of HIPAA, but that are signing BAAs. I think there are a lot of developers and vendors today that understand that. We have conversations with people that say, 'Well, we're using compliant hosting. We know we're not doing all these other things, or we might not be doing all these other things related to compliance that are required, but we have a BAA with our hosting provider, so we're usually able to get past the compliance and/or security roadblock or hurdle at the enterprise.

  There is an awareness of this - with business associates and with vendors - that transparency is something that they are largely lacking, but there are these hosting providers who are checking the BAA box for them. There are specific requirements in HIPAA that would be realized if a vendor went through an audit because an auditor would look at all these different components like disaster recovery, logging and back up, and encryption and other pieces. That's why we see so many health care organizations asking vendors - even small vendors - for an audit report, which many small vendors don't have and can't provide because they're expensive, because they're time consuming, and because a lot of the services that are required, from a technology perspective, are just hard to manage by a smaller organization.

  At Datica we take a radically different approach. We open up all of our [policies](https://policy.datica.com/), we host them on Github for version control; we open up our [business associate agreements](https://policy.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-(“baa”)). We're creating more [tools](https://hipaa.datica.com/) that clearly indicate the different requirements that exist within HIPAA, and then how we map to those different requirements. We want to clearly lay out our responsibilities and obligations, and ultimately our risk, as an organization. For our customers, we want them to understand what their obligations are, what are all the obligations that exist within HIPPA, and then where the gaps are so that they can then address those gaps for healthcare organizations.

  Our ultimate goal, through transparency - hopefully for us, as well as our customers - is to make it easier to sell into healthcare organizations. For us, customer data must be protected, privacy is paramount, and there's pretty clear and transparent mappings to all the different requirements that exist within HIPAA. We take the approach of compliance by design and compliance through transparency, and we think it's something that as an industry would help increase the pace of adoption of modern cloud-based technologies - not just for us, not just for our customers - but more broadly speaking, for all of the industry.

    could save you some big risks and some even bigger costs.

'
  :blog_lead: 'In a world where technology, healthcare, and business are all integrated,
    a thorough understanding of semantics is critical, especially when [PHI (protected
    health information)](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    is at risk. No matter what your relationship with HIPAA may be, knowing the difference
    between being HIPAA ready and HIPAA compliant could save you some big risks and

  :post: |
    A general rule of thumb is to be very chary when providers of hosting platforms are claiming to be “HIPAA ready” or “HIPAA certified”; preferably target potential business partners that are “HIPAA audited” or “HIPAA compliant.” Just about any technology can be considered HIPAA ready but what do vendors really mean when they say that? All that being “ready” affirms is that the scope of your audit is extended to include those components. This will require your internal information security team to approve the system architecture in comprehensive detail prior to commencement, which will lengthen or even prevent you from launching your program.

    On the other hand, [Datica](https://datica.com/), a proven and audited [HIPAA compliant](https://datica.com/compliance/) platform, is healthcare’s trusted service in digital health for a reason. Our customers utilize our audit reports, policy page, and HIPAA mappings as the foundation of their compliance programs. With a [HIPAA ready platform service](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/), the reliance you can foster in that provider is defunct from the very beginning.

    At Datica, we have taken the burden of compliance (policies, procedures, audits, technology, training, etc.) so our customers can focus on what they do best. Our [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) is even used as evidence to auditors to prove certain qualifications of HIPAA. These benefits of authentic HIPAA compliance are lost when falling into the wordplay trap that these HIPAA ready hosting services and platforms advertise.

    In this day and age, a critical mistake that healthcare organizations make in concerns to HIPAA is assuming  compliance is as simple as implementing security tools to prevent PHI breaches, or implementing assessment procedures that can potentially catch problems before proving to be incidental. Although HIPAA is a regulation that can be complex and difficult to fully grasp, there is one thing that should be commonly understood:

    **Just because you’re _HIPAA Ready_ does not mean that you are ready for HIPAA.**

'
  :post: |+
    Fortunately, Datica is here to help you by making sure your training focuses solely on what clinicians need to know, which will save time and increase engagement. Here are the five key topics we suggest you focus on in your HIPAA training sessions:

    ## 1) Remote Access to the Electronic Health Record (EHR)

    With all of the documentation that clinicians deal with during the workdays, they could be accessing EHRs from their home to keep with their responsibilities. But if they are not properly trained on how to access these records, they could be setting your healthcare system up for a security breach. Here are a few tips:

    - Enact a two-step authentication for allowing remote access
    - Implement immediate sessions termination following a clinician signing in and being inactive for a predetermined amount of time.
    - Inaugurate personal firewall software on all laptops and machine that store protected health information or connect to networks where protected health information may be stored.
    - Place an embargo on clinicians from remotely accessing EHRs except in certain instances

    ## 2) Mobile Device Controls and Security

    Missing or stolen devices (laptops, tablets, and phones) account for the most HIPAA security breaches. If clinicians have protected health information on these devices, these devices must be encrypted, password protected, and have safeguards properly implemented. Consider having clinicians sign a mobile device security agreement to emphasize the importance of housing data on these devices.

    ## 3) Pertinent EHR Access

    Clinicians are not oblivious to the HIPAA Privacy rules and their responsibilities but part of that responsibility is that they only access patients’ information if they are directly involved in the care. Consistently stress the importance of this to ensure that staff members do not violate this rule and that they will be facing audits to ensure nothing goes askew.

    ## 4) Email and Texting Guidance

    Since email and texting are so convenient for clinicians, some may be sending protected health information through these channels without a second thought. Be sure to drive the message that sharing information through these channels should always be avoided. Be sure to provide HIPAA compliant communication tools in alternative to these, such as HIPAA compliant secure messaging through patient portals.

    ## 5) Social Media Channel Guidance

    In the modern day, most clinicians are somehow involved with at least one social media channel, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. Be sure to highlight that they should be keeping their social media pages private to avoid any requests from friends that are double as patients. Also be sure and address that clinicians need to ensure their blogging appropriately if applicable, and not as a source to provide health guidance to patients.

    All in all, HIPAA compliance training should be very thorough but still direct with your clinicians. These are points to be treated as critical training areas for your organization.

  :summary: The cost of a HIPAA audit depends on audit type – HIPAA gap assessment,

    > You must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. — Andrew Jackson

    At Datica we've been through [three external audits](https://datica.com/compliance/hitrust/) conducted by a large, national auditing firm. In all three cases, I've personally led the efforts from our side, coordinating our internal resources as needed. I wouldn't call it a fun process, but it has helped add rigor to our internal security and compliance programs. It validated the hard work we've done to build a fully [HIPAA compliant platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/), and associated organization, that exceeds the HIPAA rules. We've also learned what does and does not meet HIPAA standards from an external or auditor perspective.
  :post: "Cost seems to be one of a few gating factors for companies considering a
    HIPAA audit. It's certainly a topic we are asked about constantly. I touched on
    the cost of audits in my last post on [proving HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/).
    If you look at the cost of a HIPAA audit, it breaks into two broad categories.\n\n1.
    Direct costs\n2. Indirect costs.\n\nLet's walk through how costs are calculated
    in both.\n\n## Direct Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nThe easier bucket to calculate.
    It begins with the costs for an auditing firm to conduct the audit and deliver
    a report. Curiously, the auditor's charge is frequently used by most people use
    to calculate the overall cost of an audit, which is definitely not accurate. Different
    types of HIPAA audits exist. The costs are different for each. Datica has completed
    all of the audits below.\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment**. The best starting point.
    It is meant to identify gaps and remediation plans for those gaps. It's the cheapest
    option and least time consuming. It often does not require an onsite visit from
    an auditor. A gap assessment leads to a full HIPAA audit; after the gap assessment,
    organizations spend time addressing the gaps before beginning a full HIPAA audit.
    **The direct cost is about $15,000-$20,000.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit**. A full
    HIPAA audit, when applied to technology vendors, assesses an organization against
    all the [requirements in HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    It's a long list. It includes both technical settings and configurations as well
    as administrative requirements like training and business associate agreements.
    It will involve an auditor visit and will require documentation to support claims
    about security and compliance; this can include showing specific technology settings
    like password rules and guest access. **The direct cost is about $20,000-$25,000.**\n*
    **Validated HITRUST Assessment**. HITRUST is a more [complete, certifiable version
    of HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/). It was created by large healthcare
    enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but
    goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance
    programs. There's now a standard web app that you use to enter information. Those
    entries are then validated by HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization,
    reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you hopefully get
    HITRUST CSF Certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees
    to HITRUST and to your auditor (approved assessor). **The direct cost is about
    $30,000-$45,000** (cost can be much higher for larger organizations).\n\n## Indirect
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\n> It's really clear that the most precious resource
    we all have is time. - Steve Jobs\n\nIndirect costs are harder to quantify. The
    biggest factor to consider is time. For each of the types of audit above, the
    indirect costs increases as you move down the list. For each of our audits, we
    estimated the total time spent for all employees (we didn't break it out by each
    employee so it's not perfect).\n\n* **Gap Assessment: 40 hours.**\n* **Full HIPAA
    Audit: 100 hours.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment: 200 hours.**\n\nEqually
    hard to estimate was the time spent between each audit to address issues and \"harden\"
    our compliance and info sec programs. This time was not captured for any of the
    specific audits and contributes to the overall cost of compliance.\n\n## Total
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nWe conservatively estimated the cost of an hour of work
    to be $100/hour. This is partially loss for the cost of salaries + benefits and
    partially loss from opportunity cost of not doing other things with this time
    (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc). Based on those numbers,
    the total cost of the different audits are:\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment - $17,800-$22,800.**
    \n* **Full HIPAA Audit - $27,000-$32,000.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment
    - $44,000-$59,000.** \n\n## It's more than cost\n\nIf you are considering an audit,
    cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors
    that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For
    us, it was a nobrainer because our audits are part of our value proposition to
    customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having
    done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large
    deals.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply
    a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews,
    sort of like miniature audits. These too cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
