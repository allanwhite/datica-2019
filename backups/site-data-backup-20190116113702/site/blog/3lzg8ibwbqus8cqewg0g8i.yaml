  :summary: HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. To make compliance
    easier for companies working with PHI, we open source our HIPAA policies.
  :blog_lead: 'Today is a big day for us, and for those businesses striving for HIPAA
    compliance. [Starting today, we are open sourcing all our company policies.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)
    Are you a company who handles PHI and trying to achieve HIPAA compliance? Then
    you''ll find what we are about to share compelling and useful.

'
  :post: |
    Achieving [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) generally has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Encryption, logging, monitoring, backup—these are just a few examples. Since the beginning, Datica has worked every day to take on these technical burdens for our customers.

    The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities, and these are where _your_ company policies come into play. Non-technical guidelines include signing [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), risk management procedures, and policies for training, among many other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

    When we were creating our policies, we found several templates for healthcare providers, but nothing for modern health technology companies. We spent a vast amount of time and effort writing our policies, then adapting them to meet the demands of external audits. We don't want people to reinvent the wheel; trust us, it's not fun. We also feel a broader community can improve these polices over time, making them better for everybody.

    By open sourcing our own company policies, we hope other healthcare companies will benefit. It aligns with our company mission: to help you focus on fixing healthcare without spending all of your time on HIPAA.

    The policies are hosted on GitHub, the premier public platform for open-sourced content. [To read more, head over to the project's homepage.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)

    Let us know if you find these useful!

  :summary: 'Day 3 of re:Invent kicked off with AWS CEO, Andy Jassy, announcing Fargate
    among a slew of new AWS services. Can you tell we''re excited about Fargate?

'
  :blog_lead: The third day of AWS re:Invent was kicked off this morning with Andy
    Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, announcing a slew of [new AWS services](https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/).
    One such service that has us excited is Fargate.
  :post: "As Randall Hunt put it in a [company blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-fargate/)
    announcing the new service: \n\n> AWS Fargate is an easy way to deploy your containers
    on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual
    machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers
    as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances.\"\n\nWe've
    seen an incredible increase in container adoption over the last couple of years.
    Datica has been a huge proponent of containerization technology since our founding.
    We use Docker in production on a daily basis to deliver HIPAA compliant environments
    to thousands of users. We even built our own orchestration layer in 2014, one
    year before [Kubernetes 1.0](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/07/Kubernetes-V1-Released.html)
    was released. To say we're bought into the concept of containers would be a massive
    understatement.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\"
    dir=\"ltr\">No longer any need to manage servers and clusters for your containers
    - AWS Fargate - Run ECS and EKS without managing servers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/reInvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#reInvent</a>
    <a href=\"https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL\">https://t.co/oPsXdvrSAL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lZnS558CXV\">pic.twitter.com/lZnS558CXV</a></p>&mdash;
    AWS re:Invent (@AWSreInvent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/935910336212844544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November
    29, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"
    charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt's because of our long history of containerization
    support that we're excited about AWS Fargate. However, that excitement isn't without
    reservation. As is the case with most new technology, compliance and security
    pose great barriers to adoption. We're deeply aware of these barriers at Datica.
    [The Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) was designed to address the
    complexities of compliance and security specific to the healthcare industry. The
    fact is, understanding compliance is difficult enough. That difficulty is exasperated
    exponentially when it comes time to not only implement that understanding through
    policy, but prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt to auditors.\n\nOur primary
    reservation with Fargate is that it currently is not eligible for [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Because we [sign a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    with both AWS and our customers, we cannot guarantee full-stack compliance against
    a service that is not scoped within the BAA that we sign with AWS. This means
    our customers in the healthcare industry cannot take advantage of such a service.\n\nLuckily,
    we've been working on a Docker-based deployment feature for the better part of
    the last quarter. By working directly with our customers on improving our deployment
    process, we're approaching a limited release of Datica BYOD (bring your own docker).
    BYOD will give users the ability to deploy docker containers directly on the platform.
    No longer will deployments be restricted to the `git push` model. In the future—once
    it becomes HIPAA eligible—we plan to take complete advantage of AWS Fargate. Until
    then, we're confident BYOD will provide an excellent deployment experience for
    our customers.\n\nBYOD will be released into limited availability in December,
    2017. We're selectively working with existing customers to test these new features.
    If you're interested in participating, please reach out to me at [ryan@datica.com](mailto:ryan@datica.com),
    and if you're at AWS re:Invent stop by booth #519 to chat with us about Fargate
    and containerization!\n\n\n"

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    <figure>
    <script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/08ebxufc4q.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_08ebxufc4q seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>
    <figcaption>Datica Shared Responsibility Model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.
