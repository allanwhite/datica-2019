:summary: 'These big ideas in healthcare innovation explore a lack of interoperability,
  the role of EHRs, and how data standards like FHIR ignite transformation. '
:blog_lead: "Connectedness is the final frontier for healthcare. In many ways, the
  true breakthrough for innovation will come once interoperability becomes the default
  instead of the barrier it has been for several decades. With that focus, we recently
  compiled the six biggest ideas from the 2016 Datica Healthcare Innovation Series
  into a [third annual report](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/2016/). The report explores
  the history behind the lack of interoperability, the role EHRs play, and what new
  data standards, like FHIR, can do ignite true transformation. \n\nSince 2014, this
  continuing [interview series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) has sought to understand
  how innovation happens in healthcare. Nine of the greatest minds in healthcare share
  their insights about data standards and integration principles in the complete 2016
  annual report. These six ideas are a summation of the thoughts in the report."
:post: "## Six Big Ideas\n\n### 1. Innovation is a global endeavor. \n\n> “If you
  talk only to yourself, you stay the way you are... If you talk only to others in
  healthcare, you move with the pack... It’s only if you talk outside of your domain
  that you can leap boundaries.” — Mark Smith, MD\n\nOne truth about new ideas is
  they are typically the combination of existing ideas. Therefore the greatest innovations
  are spurred by bumping together diverse thinkers with diverse backgrounds. The more
  this happens, the higher probability true innovation will occur. The takeaway: global
  minds, often outside of healthcare, are some of the best sources of healthcare innovation
  at the national level.\n\n### 2. Part of the challenge of technology adoption is
  due to the difficulty in understanding and absorbing the technology.\n\n> “When
  I talk to implementors in the FHIR community about this, there’s this thing that
  goes around about RESTful APIs — the 5-5-5 rule — 5 seconds to find the API, 5 minutes
  to understand what it was doing and 5 hours to have something working. But to that
  I add, 5 years to begin to understand healthcare.” — Grahame Grieve \n\nWhether
  it’s the native complexity of the standard or the poor documentation that is behind
  the times, traditional data standards have not been inviting to energetic entrepreneurial
  problem solvers. The barrier to adoption is a subtle yet underrated consideration
  when wondering why interoperability isn’t better than its current state. The good
  news: FHIR tries to tackle this problem head on.\n\n### 3. The pace of FHIR adoption
  has been insanely fast (by healthcare standards). \n> ”[FHIR has] reached a point
  of adoption where there is enough critical mass to ensure that its APIs can be the
  standard and the usefulness of the platform can be assured.” -Charles Jaffe, MD,
  PhD\n\nHealthcare is rightfully skeptical of the hot newness. For decades it has
  been told what new technology or process will save the day. While FHIR doesn’t solve
  all the problems, there is an industry view that FHIR truly is a breakthrough moment
  on interoperability. The data behind the swelling sentiment is the rate of adoption
  across sub-domains, across vendors, and across use cases, as well as being embraced
  by the government.\n\n### 4. More data is not necessarily the answer to innovation
  because it’s often useless data. \n> “Doctors are rightfully skeptical in getting
  all your Fitbit or whatnot data because it doesn’t fit the way we generally use
  data.” -Ida Sim, MD, PhD\n\nThe unacceptable state of interoperability is often
  viewed as the biggest blocker to innovation. Exchanging data really is the key to
  the next healthcare transformation. Yet the other side of the coin—the deluge of
  data that is exchanged but is actually relatively useless—can be just as much of
  a depressant on innovation.\n\n### 5. The EHR must be a partner to the rest of healthcare.\n\n>
  “The government has spent somewhere between twenty to thirty billion dollars on
  EMR deployment and there is a little bit of embarrassment and concern why these
  things aren’t interoperable.” -Dr. Mark Braunstein\n\nShared incentives have not
  always been present for EHR vendors. While they have been the core driver in the
  most important transformation so far—the digitization of health data—they have not
  behaved in a way that contributes to increased interoperability and true innovation.
  In their defense, it’s not necessarily their fault: the economic incentives have
  not been present, and Meaningful Use didn’t enforce it. But that does not excuse
  the growing sentiment that EHR vendors must embrace being at the forefront of the
  next wave of transformation.\n\n### 6. Healthcare’s situations are unique.\n\n>
  “The challenges that we face are always the ones that have confronted us in my three
  plus decades for caring for patients—policy.” -Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD\n\nThis is
  not a ground-breaking thought: healthcare is unique from every other industry in
  the economy because of its combination of regulatory, economic, political, security,
  privacy, and complexity pressures—not to mention we are dealing with people’s lives,
  not tweets. But, it is important to be reminded that these situations exist, and
  healthcare innovation is predicated on managing the uniqueness up front.\n\nWe invite
  you to read the complete report for many more great insights on innovation."

    problems, startups and healthcare innovators are working to manage the challenges
    the industry is facing. However, the difficulty of achieving interoperability
    still remains the bottleneck that is hindering real breakthroughs.

'
  :post: "Why is interoperability the bottleneck though? To answer that having an
    understanding of what interoperability is must be had.  On a macro level, interoperability
    is the United States’ attempt at creating a point-of-care health information system
    that contends with the worldwide network of electronic banking. Understood from
    a business perspective, interoperability is just tech jargon for healthcare information
    that is is necessary for a required constituent of diagnosis and treatment. An
    interoperable world is one where [health data](https://catalyze.io/solutions/data-integration-control)
    can be exchanged, is portable and available wherever a healthcare consumer receives
    care. So true transfiguration mandates complete access to data from the entirety
    of patient records, trouncing the traditional isolation silos of healthcare.\n\nPromising
    progress has been made as a widespread increase in interoperability initiatives
    are underway. Showing market maturity, most providers have implemented electronic
    health record (EHR) systems with more than ninety percent of hospitals and seventy
    percent of ambulatory physicians. Because the healthcare industry is so fragmented,
    standardization is complex and convoluted but industry stakeholders are still
    pushing the interoperability needle forward.\n\nInteroperability is going to also
    be a fundamental requirement for guaranteeing the widespread adoption of EHR systems
    to achieve the economic and social advantages desired. In the absence of interoperability,
    this adoption of EHR systems will only enhance the information silos that exist
    today with even more proprietary control over patient data. Adopting EHRs that
    are not interoperable is highly questionable as it would not increase patients’
    security, well-being, or health. On the contrary, once true interoperability is
    achieved, patients will have greater choice, control, and portability with their
    healthcare data. \n\nThoughts on interoperability and how the industry is going

  :summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as
    connected health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
  :blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is
    very often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
    or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
    they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track
    an individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health
    is much more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality
    in today’s world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative
    strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day
    lives of people.
  :post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed
    Joe Kvedar, MD](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President,
    Connected Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet
    of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/) which is packed with
    real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors
    drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been a proponent
    of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest HIT influencers
    in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems to be solved.
    Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable
    sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected health journey\nSome
    aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re only likely a
    few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health journey.
    Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1. **The
    future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
    is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
    prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
    offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
    is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
    it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
    already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr.
    Kvedar explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate
    that data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis
    will become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
    the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
    that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
    digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
    it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says.
    “The next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create
    a unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected
    health journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example,
    motivating them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting
    to happen today despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr.
    Kvedar says the business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance,
    United Health Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device.
    If they achieve three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that
    wearable device, they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome
    parts of the healthcare industry seem to embrace the connected health journey
    faster than others. “Companies like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking
    in wearables’ data and giving consumers something back in return. They are all
    seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of
    the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs and hospitals are used to
    making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't quite figured out
    how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward hospitals for
    keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges are happily
    being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability \nEven
    though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for consumers,
    there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area of interoperability.
    \ Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n \n- **Proprietary
    technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s financial best
    interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you are an IT vendor,
    almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom all the way down
    to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in and upsell you
    new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering
    their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep
    you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On the
    hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven by
    the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
    a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
    to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
    interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
    award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible
    way hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could
    conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government
    purchasers that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have
    a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump
    administration, but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world
    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and
    chronic illness management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing
    health technology devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic
    illnesses but also helping to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n-
    **Wearables provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't
    result in symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol,
    visceral fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't
    really, on a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context,
    you can think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables
    provide feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a
    Fitbit, for example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be
    motivated to walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always
    motivate a lifestyle change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation.
    “It turns out there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t
    care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
    person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback
    loop is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains.
    That could be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe
    continues, “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in
    the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is
    the Spire device that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory
    rate; it tells you whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe
    differently under different conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables
    market as data becomes more meaningful to people with insights rather than just
    numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians
    today are inundated with data, most of it today within the EHR. Clinicians spend
    too much time clicking, finding, charting, and checking boxes to document the
    in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard to imagine connected health
    data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy process. Dr. Kvedar suggests
    this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n \n1. **The current state:**
    Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr. Kvedar sees connected health
    in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We have quite a few examples of
    that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and a lot of our primary care
    practices are patient centers or medical homes as part of our population health
    management structure. In those practices, there is someone whose responsibility
    is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide that person
    with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that are either
    difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is not enough
    of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
    is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to
    get their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags
    the patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort
    through. Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something
    that really needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**
    \ Most industries today are already using intelligent analysis software and data
    science that creates meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data.
    Dr. Kvedar describes how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at
    the beginning of a new era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've
    been tracking their blood pressure for the last two months. We should be able
    to give you a dashboard view that shows what blood pressures are normal when they
    go up, why they go up. Do they go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do
    they go up after a meal? That would give you some real insight into how to care
    for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions that seeing this all become a reality
    with physicians is dependent on solving more than just the problems of data overload
    and dashboards. Here are two other important dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If
    you call it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds
    scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort
    of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration. Will that change? Not sure.
    Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by two years from now will be
    value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans are now doing this but
    the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason we did medical home
    across our system is because of value-based payments and it makes much more sense
    in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of AI.** “On the one hand,
    we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call it decision support,
    maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you
    are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how you frame it. And,
    of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that and how you convince
    docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going to get sued because
    there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right in the algorithm.”
    \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The pieces of connected
    health are here today, but we still have to put them together. Some of that will
    be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is even societal.”\n\nMake

  :summary: Industry focus on patient outcomes has never been higher yet some healthcare
    innovators are focused on technology first and outcomes second. Wonder why?
  :blog_lead: 'Industry focus on patient outcomes has never been higher. Key healthcare
    stakeholders, from payers, providers, vendors and others, all indicate that this
    focus will surely escalate. The emphasis may appear new, but as early as 1998,
    the [_Journal of of General Internal Medicine_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1496942/)
    began covering the patient outcomes movement. Considering this surge in interest,
    you may be wondering why some healthcare innovators are focusing on technology
    first and outcomes second.

  :post: "In a rush to get a healthcare technology to market and a paying client on
    the books, vendors often sidestep this important piece to the solution. As a result,
    many health systems across the country are being sold new technologies that don't
    address patient outcomes first. Clinicians wonder why. In a recent [_Healthcare
    Innovators Podcast_][2], Ida Sim, MD, who is a primary care physician, informatics
    researcher, entrepreneur and Professor of Medicine at the University of California,
    San Francisco, shared her thoughts on technology implementation as it relates
    to patient outcomes. \"The place to start is not to have a great app or sensor,
    [nor] how to get as many people to use it for as long as possible,\" says Sim.
    Instead, she explains, \"Outcomes are generated jointly by the healthcare system
    and the patients themselves, so that's the place to start.\" This approach transcends
    wearables and applications; it can also be applied to larger technologies, such
    as electronic medical records (EMRs). \n\nIn some ways, starting with the technology
    is counterintuitive. Few organizations effectively manage patients outside of
    traditional episodes. Datica CEO and Chief Privacy Officer, [Travis Good, MD](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/)
    gave his perspective on the subject recently. \"The healthcare providers, focused
    most on patient outcomes, like Denver Health, have had the management of patients
    in their DNA long before applying any technology to achieve efficiencies.\" \n\n##
    Effective Technology is Outcome-Based\n\nFor healthcare innovators, starting with
    patient outcomes first promises to provide technical solutions that dramatically
    impact patients and the industry as a whole. Some development organizations are
    already taking this approach and that's exciting to watch.\n\nWorking at Datica
    gives us an in-the-trenches view of impactful industry technologies that address
    patient outcomes first. Madison-based [healthfinch][3], for example, needed EMR
    integrations for implementing its automated prescription refill solutions within
    a hospital system. Healthfinch started with the specific population need, then
    crafted a technology solution with patient outcomes at the heart of that solution.
    This story, and others from health vendors working on patient outcome-first technologies,
    can be found in the [Datica customer][4] stories. \n\nAre you developing technologies
    focused first on patient outcomes? Datica can help you scrutinize that process,
    which will ultimately provide the most value for clinicians and the hospitals
    for whom they work. That technology approach leads to long-term success and product
    viability for customers.\n\n\n[2]: /innovation/ida-sim-md/\n[3]: http://healthfinch.com\n[4]:
