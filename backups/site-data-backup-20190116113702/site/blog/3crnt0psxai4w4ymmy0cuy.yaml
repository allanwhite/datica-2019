:summary: Where do the many predictions and technologies from Health 2.0, 2012 stand
  today? Which products were a hit? What predictions came to be true—or didn't?
:blog_lead: "As we get our booth shipped and bags packed for Health 2.0 this year,
  I started thinking about when I first attended Health 2.0 five years ago. It was
  held at the Hilton in Union Square in San Francisco. I was in town for my startup's
  interview at Rock Health, which at the time was just a stroll down Geary and a left
  on Grant through the [Dragon Gate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Dragon_Gate_to_Chinatown.jpg)
  to the Rock Health offices in Chinatown. It was my first day ever in San Francisco;
  a place I would soon call home as I spent a chunk of 2012-2013 in the city for Rock
  Health. \n"
:post: "I was a digital health neophyte at the time, which is to say I worked for
  companies that were much more Health 1.0 before that: Epic, Medseek, (stylized very
  Health 1.0ish as MEDSEEK) and Nordic. I was amazed to enter a room where digital
  health could be the future and where any innovation was possible. Crowdfunding,
  changes to incentives through the ACA, and the ubiquity of cell phones dominated
  conversations about the possibilities of wireless healthcare. Predictions abounded
  about who — told in Bay Area lingo — was going to be the Uber for healthcare. For
  someone who started his career in an era when doctors believed paper was the past,
  present, and future, it was invigorating to meet non-Epic employees who actually
  believed in a digital future for healthcare. \n\nTimes have changed. So has Health
  2.0. Five years in startup time might as well feel like fifty. As a point of reference,
  you were likely a hipster making fun of Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012
  when I first attended the conference. While I was prepping for this year's Health
  2.0 I stumbled across the [legacy website for Health 2.0 in 2012](http://legacy.health2con.com/events/conferences/san-francisco-fall-2012/#venue).
  I wondered where the many topics, predictions, and technologies from 2012 stood
  today. Which ideas were a hit? What predictions came to be true and what technologies
  faded into the [\"Our Incredible Journey\"](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/)
  tumblr. Here's an overview of the future as seen from 2012, now delivered in 2017.
  \n\n## Wearables and the Quantified Self\n\n**Then:** Wearables couldn't have been
  any bigger in 2012. Even though the Fitbit was, at the time, a [clip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fitbit_products#Fitbit_Zip),
  the possibilities of what could be done by tracking health information using now
  ubiquitous technologies like Bluetooth and Smartphones were endless. There were
  many sessions showing the potential of remote monitoring and smartphones, like \"Demos
  in Context: A Live Environment Exploring Personal Trackers\" (featuring now Propeller
  Health COO Chris Hogg) and \"Off the Couch and Into Shape: Tools for Physical Fitness\"
  (featuring Under Armour before buying MyFitnessPal and MapMyFitness).\n\n**Now:**
  The good news is that every modern iPhone has a pedometer in it and that Apple Watch
  sales are up 50% in 2017. The bad news is that everyone else didn't do so hot. Pebble
  is gone. Jawbone is gone. Fitbit is at 1/50th of its value from when it IPO'd in
  2015. Did we get some good clinical research from the wearables? Actually, [yes](https://www.wired.com/story/bored-with-your-fitbit-these-cancer-researchers-arent/).
  Are we healthier as a whole? Hard to say. The good news is you're probably tracked
  everywhere now; the bad news is the wearables movement didn't necessarily materialize
  into one great set of outcomes or businesses. While startups that focused on deliver
  programs alongside wearables, like Omada Health and Propeller, have kept growing,
  other startups didn't necessarily make the leap. There's still hope for some of
  the 2012 darlings, as exemplified by Jawbone who fail-pivoted into building a \"Health
  Hub\" to compete in the more regulated health tech space.\n\n## Non-invasive Diagnosis
  and Diagnostics\n\n**Then:** There was a session on non-invasive diagnoses techniques,
  which had panelists from CellScope, Glooko (fresh off of a Series-A round of funding),
  Tawkon (tracking radiation exposure via cell phones), Transfuse Solutions, and First
  Derm. Ideas based on painful lab draws and general confusion around biometrics and
  results were beginning to gain traction at this time. \n\n**Now:** How did Elizabeth
  Holmes from Theranos not get an invite to this session? Not kidding. It feels like
  they should have been rubbing shoulders with the Bay Area darlings and \"innovators\"
  in the non-invasive blood draw space before Holmes began her Icarian rise into fame.
  Turns out there is an answer to the question, per the man himself. Health 2.0 founder
  Matthew Holt—Theranos [either ignored or eventually declined attendance at all events](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/10/16/five-takeaways-about-the-theranos-broo-ha-ha/).\n\n##
  Value-Based Care\n\n**Then:** While there were a few talks involving population
  health, the agenda for Health 2.0 mentions value-based care exactly zero times.
  There was one main stage session around ACOs and innovations in payment models.
  Conversation centered more around general cost reduction and consumer empowerment.
  Even the Twitter Health Team was getting in on the action, presenting how Twitter
  conceptualized its product being used to empower consumers in the post-ACA era.
  \n\n**Now:** Everyone's favorite digital health buzzword next to \"Big Data\" gets
  a variety of sessions and focus, though less so than [maybe last year](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/health-2.0-recap-day-3/)
  due to uncertainty driven by the government vis-a-vis the potential repeal of the
  ACA. \n\n## Blockchain\n\n**Then:** Bitcoin was hovering around $11.00-$12.00 a
  bitcoin. \n\n**Now:** The blockchain is the solution to all of our problems in health
  tech, not withstanding:\n\n1. Difficulties in patient matching \n2. The patient
  stigma/business cases of sharing data \n3. Challenges in semantic interoperability
  \n4. Any clinician's willingness to take liability for receiving more data before
  treating a patient\n\n## Startups\n\n**Then:** *Launch!* was the premier event at
  which to launch a digital health startup. The startups, their fields, and whether
  or not they are still seemingly in business were:\n\n- **TicTrac:** Personalizable
  health and wellness platform.\n- **LifeVest Health *(now Life.io)*:** Insurance
  company technology platform.\n- **meQuilibrium:** Digital resilience coaching platform\n-
  **Unfrazzled:** Seemingly shut down. App for unpaid caregivers.\n- **First Stop
  Health:** Telemedicine for employers.\n- **EveryMove:** Wellness Platform\n- **Share
  the Visit:** Seemingly shut down. Telemedicine, but for family members and caregivers
  for other patient visits.\n- **ShareMD:** Pivoted to Datica :). [\"Pinterest for
  Doctors\"](http://legacy.health2con.com/tv/speaker/travis-good/)\n\n**Now:**  There
  are now 12 startups pitching this year. Kind of amazing to see how many of the startups
  from *Launch!* 2012 survived and thrived given the vast changes in health tech and
  healthcare over the last five years. As for ShareMD, [Travis Good and Mohan Balachandran](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/)
  realized how hard it was to get their platform for residents into the hands of clinicians
  due to the arduous and varying requirements imposed on their cloud platforms by
  academic medical centers. Realizing they weren't the only vendors with this problem,
  Datica’s founders saw the real product wasn't the social network but, rather, the
  platform that would make it easier for vendors and organizations to prove and ascertain
  application compliance. And, as such, Datica (née Catalyze) was born. \n\nI hope
  you enjoyed this walk down memory lane. If you enjoyed this blog post, come see
  us at any or all the events we'll be participating in at Health 2.0: \n\n- Come
  learn about the lessons Datica has learned over the last five years and compare
  them to other experiences veterans are seeing in the field at our [Lunch and Learn
  panel at 12:30 on Monday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/194628).
  Christiana DelloRusso from Providence Ventures, Carolyn Jasik from Omada Health,
  and Kristi Ebong from Cedars-Sinai Accelerator will be joining Travis for a panel
  discussion about what success in digital health really looks like. \n- Our VP of
  Product Ryan Rich will be demoing on stage how easy it can be to deploy code in
  a compliant environment at [11:20 on Tuesday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/204332).
  \n- And, finally, we'll be at Booth #204 to talk about how we can help you be successful
  in digital health through compliance, security and healthcare data integration.
  Stop by and take our 3-minute assessment based on the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/)
  to find out how far you’ve come in your own digital health journey and how far you
  still have to go.\n"

    which told a unified story and compelling insight worth sharing. '
  :blog_lead: |-
    Day One of Health 2.0 featured the annual Traction startup pitch session. Many interesting companies presented, from [biome.io][1] to [strollhealth.com][2]. The panel prior had compelling insight worth sharing. The group of investors told a unified story across several key conversation topics:

    [1]: http://biome.io/
    [2]: http://strollhealth.com/
  :post: "* Digital Health is in the \"Trough\" of the Gartner hype cycle. There was
    a lot of promise, now under delivery, but eventually will get to the Plateau of
    Maturity. They are hopeful, but it needs to be said that Digital Health is not
    accomplishing what it promised.\n* A focus on ROI with a partnership-based relationship
    is the key to gaining tractions for Digital Health. \n* They see a lot of unintentional
    exits in the next year due to underperforming by Digital Health startups. \n*
    So many ideas are \"cute\" and addressing the over-served \"FitBit\" population,
    and not enough ideas are tackling the hard problems in other populations, like
    the elderly or social safety nets.\nThe rest of the day consisted of a few themes.
    \ \n\n## Blockchain\n\nThe first was all about Blockchain—a radical concept responsible
    for Bitcoin and innovations in FinTech—that is now starting to creep over into
    healthcare. \n\nMany proponents of the Blockchain claim hefty promises.  \n\n*
    It will be the catalyst to finally eliminate paper usage.\n* It will de-risk fraud.\n*
    It will be the endgame for identity management.\n* It will be invisible and thus
    the new CPU to all future cloud computation.\nAt the Blockchain panel, skeptics—from
    Taariq Lewis of [Serica][3] present on the panel, to a gentleman asking questions
    during the Q&A—asked thoughtful questions. Taariq isn't sure the Blockchain is
    the right technology for identity because it wasn't designed to work that way.
    He's also wary anytime mentions \"smart contracts\" because they aren't always
    what they appear to be. And once a \"smart contract\" is created, it doesn't end,
    much like a bot. A questioner at the end wondered if current approaches to the
    Blockchain in healthcare are the \"Friendster of Healthcare Blockchain technology\",
    in that it helps create awareness but ultimately gets a lot of early things wrong.\n\nTime
    will tell how real Blockchain really is in healthcare, but a major takeaway on
    Day One is the hype wave is cresting at its highest peak.\n\nAfter the panel,
    I overheard an older gentleman telling someone else, \"I went to this because
    I had heard about this blockchain thing but have no idea how it works or what
    it even is.\"\n\nInterest piqued, I stopped and asked him a few brief questions.
    Turns out this fellow worked for an HCO, and was investigating whether new blockchain
    concepts could help their technology strategy.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly how I
    would use the concept of a blockchain today, but the idea sounds cool,\" he told
    me. \"I worry that it's being billed as the savior for so many different problems,
    like identity management to revenue cycle management to eliminating fraud.\"\n\nThis
    is the insight worth considering with Blockchain. It most definitely will have
    a major influence in healthcare. Somehow, someday. But the technology is still
    immature, and the concept so new and foreign to almost all decision makers within
    healthcare, that it is inappropriately being billed as the fix-all for every problem
    healthcare faces. This risks the technology over-promising and under-delivering.
    \ \n\n## The Unacceptables\n\nThe second half of the day was more nuanced. It
    was a collection of presentations, panels, and discussions around what was dubbed
    \"The Unacceptables\" by Health 2.0.\n\nA few years ago, they put forth \"The
    Unmentionables.\" These were topics such as stress and exercise which affected
    health, but were rarely considered or quantified by providers and payers alike.\n\nIn
    a declaration of victory, Health 2.0 moved on from The Unmentionables and is now
    putting scope around The Unacceptables. These are topics such as diversity, violence,
    and other topics holding healthcare innovation back.\n\nTo Health 2.0's credit,
    they facilitated several different types of conversations around the idea, beyond
    just workshops and Lunch & Learns. Harvery Fineberg, president of Gordon and Betty
    Moore Foundation, gave a rousing speech on designing systems to better healthcare.
    We welcome the foundation's attention.   \n\n## Digital Snake Oil\n\nDr. James
    Madara conducted a one-on-one to discuss partnerships with MATTER and his role
    with Health 2.0's SMART initiative.\n\nThe topic mirrored similar threads throughout
    the day. Digital Health has not succeeded at delivering on the promises given
    a few years ago, but the benefits it can deliver are very real, and very important.\n\nIt's
    up to healthcare broadly, and decision makers specifically, to treat relationships
    more like a partnerships, and work together towards implementing the changes needed
    to improve the system as a whole.\n\n[3]: https://sericatrading.com/"

  :blog_lead: Day Two of Health 2.0 featured a diverse set of topics. The conference
    deserves credit for the breadth of session options. There was more to see than
    the Datica crew could cover, so we'll focus on just a few key observations.
  :post: |-
    ## Physician Health

    Perhaps one of the more underrated phenomena in healthcare is physician burnout. There isn't nearly enough attention paid to the topic compared to its national prevalence and deep negative impact on overall patient care. In many ways, an unfair majority of innovations and new technologies are focused on the patient, and not enough are focused on the humans caring for the patient, so to speak.

    Day One featured almost zero discussion on the topic, but Day Two started off with several mentions and then escalated to a consistent theme on both the main stage and in breakout sessions.

    In short, clinicians, and physicians specifically, are frustrated. They are burnt out.

    "Physicians spend 2 hours typing to every 1 hour seeing patients," said [Jesse Ehrenfeld][1] of the AMA on stage.

    We then heard over and over how unhappy the provider cohort is with the state of technology and the burden new technology is putting on them.

    This is a big deal.

    ## What is the future of "interoperability"?

    The day brought several presentations from different organizations discussing the very thing Day One participants begged to have: better collaboration and partnership. (In fact, that message was echoed again: Walgreens and the U.S. Government both said on stage they view collaboration among organizations as the single biggest key to their growth objectives.)

    We saw APIs talk about silver bullets, and that being the path towards interoperability.

    We saw PHRs talk about the importance and magic of putting data into patients' hands via mobile apps, and that being an example of interoperability.

    We saw Blockchain—again.

    We saw new sources of data, or different data types, and that being a new angle on interoperability.

    We then saw apps who get data into the hands of doctors via tablets as a breakthrough in interoperability, but didn't really discuss how they get the data, just that they display the data.

    Here's the thing: What we didn't have was voices from Epic, Cerner, eCW, or McKesson talking about how they would make data access via their EHRs easier. We didn't hear how providers and payers have little to no incentive—still, even with value-based payments looming—to share their data. And we didn't have a conversation around the politics it takes to complete simple integrations, which are the building blocks of interoperability.

    We're not sure Health 2.0 can really tell you what the future of interoperability is. In many ways, it's an idyllic vision, and should be what we are all striving towards. But in many other ways, the conference seems to skirt talking about the real issues that make interoperability tough. Issues that are dirty, muddy, boring, not fun, serious, multi-faceted, and take forever.

    ## Interfaces (UX/UI) are really maturing

    There were many impressive demos throughout the entire day. People are working on truly novel ideas that look gorgeous, even if interoperability is still a challenge!

    A big take away is the maturity in application interfaces. Things are really getting good.

    By far the best demo of the entire conference was from [Human Longevity][2]. Not only was their gene sequence search tool mind-blowing, but it was so obvious their interface—a simple search box!—is the eventual endgame for data discovery. Think about it: Digital Natives (could also be said as "Millennial Doctors") are already accustomed to a simple search box. They already know how to slice and dice via an input mechanism. This has been discussed at length in other industries where "bots" and "chat interfaces" are exploding in popularity. It's a thing. A hierarchical taxonomy for the navigation of an EHR is so...pre-Google. Eventually getting to the point of powerful search, layered with bots and true machine learning, is the future. Like the _real_ future, one that is adopted by clinicians.

    Other interfaces were impressive, too. Demos featuring voice technology, especially Amazon's Alexa, were fantastic. We thought [WELL Health][3] had an elegant and impressive app UI that could be adopted instantly by the target user base.

    If there is one thing healthcare _can_ learn from it's industry siblings, is that true, differentiating innovation can happen at the human interface layer. Google, Slack, Apple, and others have taught us this. The other compelling insight is interface innovations are often the easiest new technologies to absorb. There is no reason why search, "feeds and speeds", or voice inputs can't be a true wedge.

    few panel discussions of the conference.
  :post: "## Diversity of care\n\nOne of the more powerful themes that sets up a tentpole
    topic for 2017 is the diversity of types of care. It's now obvious there are several
    different types of care. Health 2.0 explained it like such:\n\n* Healthy patients
    are lighter touch\n* Chronically Ill patients require maintained focus\n* Acutely
    Ill patients are at risk and a priority\n* Healthy patients on the verge of becoming
    Chronically Ill are concerns and should be monitored\n* Chronically Ill patients
    on the verge of becoming Acutely Ill are a danger\n* Meanwhile Acutely Ill can
    come back to Chronically Ill through certain care\n* And Acutely Ill can go back
    to being Healthy patients\n\nWhew, a lot of bullet points. What does it mean?\n\nSimply
    this: We are starting to understand better than ever as technologists where Digital
    Health products and services belong along the continuum of care.\n\nBut more importantly
    the opposite is true, too. _One size does not fit all._ Diversity of patients
    combined with diversity of care situations means healthcare requires a diversity
    of products and innovations.\n\nThe bummer, as we heard all week, is this also
    means physicians and health system decision makers (CIOs, et al) are inundated
    with too many solutions, too many options, too many things to divert focus.\n\nWhat
    will be interesting is where this diversity point and the over-burden point meet.
    That feels where real progress will be made.\n\n## Is it time for Health 3.0?\n\nJonathan
    Bush, CEO of [athenahealth][1], provided the biggest spark of the conference,
    in the only way he can. He took Health 2.0 to task. \"Health 2.0 needs to die
    along with the old concept of interoperability,\" was the shocking call out. \n\nWait,
    what? It was actually quite powerful. Jonathan's point was \"health 2.0\" as a
    concept is tied to \"digital health\" as a patient-centric, empathic focus on
    technological innovation, which is totally cool, but we have largely convinced
    everyone of the importance, so now we should build on top of that and focus on
    what's next. We need to move onto \"health 3.0\" with bigger ideas. His positioning
    of \"what's next\" is a new concept of interoperability. No longer should we consider
    \"interoperability\" as the drudgery of connecting unique, replica systems everybody
    maintains on their own. Instead it should be \"networked health\" of authoritative
    yet connected datasets.\n\nIt's compelling, and my paragraph doesn't do the justice
    of Jonathan's hour-long delivery, which was rousing.\n\nWe share a similar view
    (though still consider data central to the future of healthcare, obviously). In
    a way, the path towards interoperability is more about connections and networks,
    and less about data. You could say the more healthcare is networked, the better
    the data will get, anyways.\n\n## Focus on the patient\n\nLastly, we should call
    out the importance of the patient in all of this. It was a popular topic throughout
    most panels, and the majority of all demos the entire day focused on the patient.
    It's important to never forget.\n\nA quote from Darren Dworkin, CIO of Ceders-Sinai,
    was exceedingly insightful. He said, \"Where our digital health experiments have
    failed are when new innovations thin the patient-clinician relationship too much.
    We can't get ahead of our skis too much. It's ultimately about the patient-clinician
    relationship.\"\n\nThis is a fine point to end the conference. While we are here
    to improve patient outcomes at lower costs (a favorite mantra of HCO executives),
    all of healthcare is ultimately two-sided. You have the patient but you'll always
    have the clinician too. Technology needs to not only improve the life of the clinician,
    but the relationship between the two.\n\n[1]: http://athenahealth.com"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
