  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Health—The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,
    among others. His expertise on compliance, HIPAA, and health IT is highly regarded
    and sought after. He recently released his first book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). "

:post: "It's been an exciting year for Datica!\n\nWe launched [Redpoint][2] in December
  2015 to much fanfare. To date, Redpoint's product and services power millions of
  messages processed between healthcare partners per day. It is mission-critical infrastructure
  for over 300 sites, serving customers focused on changing healthcare through innovative
  new ideas.\n\nWe then re-launched our original Platform as a Service as [Stratum][3]
  in March 2016. Stratum expanded our ability to help large enterprise customers with
  unique requirements obtain HITRUST CSF Certified credentials in a cloud environment
  as they look to migrate existing technologies to the cloud as well as build new
  solutions to address paradigm shifts in the industry around care management and
  risk.\n\nWe attended several [events][4]. My co-founder Mohan Balachandran and I
  had opportunities to be present at the largest events like HIMSS to the smallest,
  private events like Health Evolution Partners Summit. Mark Olschesky, Casey Bryson,
  myself, and other team members presented keynotes or focused talks at several other
  events. My favorite was Mark getting a chance to talk FHIR at the HL7 FHIR Applications
  Roundtable in July.\n\nDatica was given the honor of being involved with the inaugural
  Business Associate Council, created by the HITRUST Alliance. Here Datica has the
  ability to hear first-hand the impact HITRUST is having in the industry, while also
  playing a part in shaping its future. We're thrilled to participate.\n\nPlus many
  more wonderful things, from [key executive][5] hires to building out more of our
  expert team to the positive feedback from customers.\n\nWe're excited to share this
  fund raise with all of you, our customers and the community. We're here to help
  you be successful at improving healthcare, whether by serving you with our products
  or providing open source policies to get you started. \n\nThe story really is about
  our customers. We're so thankful they have put their trust in us, and we work every
  day to never let them down. This fund raise is about building momentum towards doing
  more of this exact thing—serving others. We can't wait to see what the next year
  has in store.\n\n[1]: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/09/prweb13694385.htm\n[2]:
