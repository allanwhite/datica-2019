  _In part one of our series on 2017 Healthcare trends, we explored [the rise of the patient as consumer][1]. Here, in part two of our four-part series, we look at how Trump's unpacking of Obamacare might affect the healthcare industry this year._

  The financial viability and plans for the insurance exchanges may [not have panned out][2] the way Obama's team anticipated but there are a lot more people in the US who have insurance under Obamacare than before Obamacare. And, there are a lot of people who are now concerned about what changes the new Trump administration will bring to their healthcare.

  ## 2017 Healthcare Trend #2: Unpacking the ACA

  > "There isn't any way of putting the genie back in the bottle." -Edward MacMahon

  Unpacking the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and [repealing coverage for millions of Americans](http://fortune.com/2017/06/20/obamacare-repeal-trump-ahca-mean/) is going to be very hard for the new administration. There will invariably be changes to Obamacare, something that is clear from [Trump's appointments][4]. The most likely things to change will be things like the individual mandate and the requirement for ACA-approved plans for businesses. These changes will have a large impact on payers who participate in exchanges and for businesses that offer insurance for employees.

  The area where there is less clarity around the direction for U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) relates to [MACRA and MIPS][5], which I use as proxies for the new payment models (readmission, bundles, etc.) and the broad shifts of payment for care from quantity to quality. There has already been pushback from health systems about two new payment models to test in fifteen months, an indication of the pace of change for providers. It seems most likely that Trump's HHS will continue down the path of shifting care from quantity to quality.

  At the highest level, shifting from volume to value is about delivering continuous, quality care. It's about extending the view of a hip replacement, just one example, as a point-in-time episode to a ninety-day episode. This is a major shift requiring new technology and, more challengingly, changes in workflows and internal processes. This shift will also require new partnerships. Some systems, especially integrated delivery networks [like Kaiser][6], are aligned and organized to deliver care in this quality-care model while many others will need to partner, not just for the technology but also for the care navigators and other care team members. It's closely related to the point I made in the [first article in this series][1] about offering complete, ready-to-deploy solutions. Pure technology offerings are going to fail unless they are an enabling layer, such as an API that combines some unique, proprietary sets of data to deliver a valuable new data set or resource; simply API-enabling existing standalone systems, such as EHRs, is not a long-term differentiated product.

  The next level down in volume to value is purely about data, not for care but for reporting and comparison purposes. Reporting is the initial stage for new payment models like bundles. It provides HHS with new and powerful data from which healthcare providers can be compared. The reported data is compiled from multiple sources, not just the EHR, so it is not a simple matter of reporting data that providers already have available but instead is a challenging, multi-step process. The first challenge is compiling the data. The second is reporting it. The third, one which is not required by HHS but is essential for care providers to succeed in new payment models, is the analysis of reported data. All three of these challenges will see new, enabling solutions that will excel. These new data layers will power the care management platforms of the future.

  ## Increased uncertainty and turmoil

  If nothing else, the Trump election, exacerbated by the surprise nature of the outcome, increased the amount of uncertainty and turmoil in the healthcare industry. In an industry with variable margins and resources by sector, this uncertainty disproportionately will benefit life sciences companies and, to a lesser extent, payers, over health systems. Health systems will be cautious in spending on major strategic initiatives like patient engagement, while life sciences companies will accelerate efforts to own the [patient as consumer][7].

  Next week, for the [third part of this series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/),  I'll share _"The Rise and Fall of the EHR"_ a look at the part EHRs will play in the new guard of health IT.

    Meaningful Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in [increasingly the adoption of EHRs](http://www.nuance.com/for-healthcare/ehr-meaningful-use-physician-study/index.htm). In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. [All of this data entry](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/4-000-clicks-per-shift-ed-physicians-emr-burden.html) has been at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.

    ## EHRs weren't built for the future of healthcare

    > "Your margins are my opportunity." Jeff Bezos

    The problem with EHRs is that the government and health systems spent billions of dollars on software and organizational change that doesn't address any of the challenges discussed in the [first][1], [second][2], and [fourth articles](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-4-healthcare-costs-and-challenges/) in this series. EHRs weren't built for the future of healthcare. Thankfully, change in healthcare is slow so the past and current state of healthcare will be around for a while.

    Additionally, as other sectors like life sciences move to own the patient as the end user, they erode the value of the EHR as the main hub of clinical data. I guess [Walgreens is the example of the opposite][6] case as it is rolling out Epic but my guess is Walgreens rolled out Epic for the reasons I cited above, namely ease of integration with existing providers and provider data.

    ## Gaining access to EHR data

    Just because EHRs weren't built for a future based on quality and value doesn't mean EHR vendors aren't rapidly trying to adapt EHRs to remain relevant for the future. One major example is easing access to EHR data through [EHR integrations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/ehr-integrations/). There are major EHR vendors that made, and still make, significant revenue by charging hefty fees for interfaces and data access. The industry is demanding, and the EHR vendors are finally conceding to grant, access to EHR data. That access is seen as essential to enable future-facing tools for things like patient engagement, population health, and clinical collaboration. For at least four to five years now, major EHR vendors like Epic and Cerner have been talking about providing modern web interfaces for EHR data. There's now a standard called [FHIR][7] that has been getting tons of attention as an API for EHRs. In 2017, we will see more and more EHRs providing access to snippets of data on an individual patient basis. It's hard not to see that as a very small and intentionally slow step towards opening up access to clinical data so the industry can really start to understand the power of that data.

    The other alternative for EHR data access is for providers to query a network of EHRs for data about a patient they are seeing. These networks of different EHRs have [in this way.][8] Epic already enables this type of sharing, in an Epic to Epic only way, for participating customers. Having a provider click, request, and view data from a different provider isn't really harnessing the power of data and is not going to significantly improve outcomes or lower costs. It will help with some inefficiencies in acquiring records from other providers but this is barely even the low hanging front of clinical data access.

    ## Are the glory days of EHRs over?

    This lack of alignment between EHRs, their business models, and the direction of healthcare as it [onramps to the cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/) shows EHRs as the hubs of care and clinical data, at best, are at their peak value and, at worst, have already peaked. This has massive implications as EHRs are the major software vendors for care delivery and behemoth companies that represent a significant part, in terms of dollars, of the total health IT market. Similarly to non-healthcare enterprises, EHRs over time will be eroded like Oracle, Siebel, and SAP were by Salesforce, Workday, and Slack. This is a ten to fifteen year process that is only now just beginning but will eventually usher in the new guard of enterprise health IT as it moves into the [healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).

    This will have a major impact on enterprise IT departments since many of those organizations have large proportions of people and budgets dedicated to managing EHRs. Additionally, most of the new guard of health IT will be [cloud based](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/) and not on-premise, as most EHRs are today. The cloud, specifically the [public cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/), is here now in healthcare. It'll be years before major healthcare enterprises fully adopt and move the majority of compute workloads to the cloud but the migration is starting, it's a big migration, and it starts with SaaS solutions that will chip away at the EHRs dominance. The broader shift to the cloud will drive additional significant changes to how enterprise IT operates in healthcare.

    Next week, for the [fourth and final article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-4-healthcare-costs-and-challenges/) in this 2017 trends series,  I'll share "_Healthcare costs and challenges are about a lot more than healthcare,"_ a look at the quest to reduce costs and improve outcomes in healthcare.

    Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll present four high-level trends that follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and new problems. Here's the 2017 healthcare trend #1.

    ## Walgreens, payors, life sciences, subscription medicine and the rise of the patient as consumer

    > "Businesses are no longer the sole creator of a brand; it is co-created by consumers through shared experiences and defined by the results of online searches and conversations." - Brian Solis

    One of the major shifts that has come to healthcare is the patient is at the center of the ecosystem. This has come about for a few reasons, namely due to societal and cultural shifts driving changing expectations but also because patients are feeling the burden of the costs of care more and more. [Shifts in technology](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/) are underlying some of these shifts as well and certainly are enabling models of care where patients have more ownership.

    The reasons for the change are less important than the impact of the change on the industry and patients/consumers. Healthcare, a multi-trillion dollar industry, is experiencing a paradigm shift and the main user, the end user, is now the patient/consumer. This means the consumer is the new target and the [choke point][3] to massive aspects of the most massive industry in the world. Look no further than the myriad of initiatives from all the major sectors trying to "win" the consumer.

    * **Life sciences companies** are transforming themselves from makers of therapeutics to care management platforms that are complemented by therapeutics. This is an incredible change but one that is being taken because, like direct-to-consumer products, life sciences companies need to have a direct relationship with the end-user to effectively market and retain them as lifetime customers with very targeted marketing and promotion. Life sciences companies are well resourced and motivated to make this change, and will be spending more than any other segment to win the end user and deliver care management platforms.
    * **Retail pharmacies**, most specifically Walgreens and CVS, have been [expanding][4] their care delivery services, becoming more than simple drug dispensaries. Retail pharmacies now offer both chronic and acute care, preventative medicine (vaccines most specifically), and even telemedicine. Pharmacies are well placed, having 10s of 1000s of physical locations across the country, to be a larger and larger part of the way consumer access the healthcare system. Walgreens is even rolling out Epic as its EHR; despite being a strange choice for a retail clinic, Epic helps Walgreens integrate data to and from other Epic customers.
    * **Payors**, the largest ones in particular â€“ United, Cambia, Blues, etc. â€“ are expanding the tools they offer members to be more than simple data access and payment tools. Large insurance companies are building and testing apps for specific conditions and cohorts of members, wanting to flip the perception of payors in consumers' minds to more than payment tools managed by their employers. [Oscar][5] is a good example of a payor that doesn't act like a traditional payor.
    * **Subscription medicine** is here to stay, whether you call it [direct primary care (DPC)][6] or concierge. Concierge and DPC, interestingly, are the providers' response to this trend. Subscription medicine is about a direct relationship between providers and patients, without messy payors and administrative overhead between them. And subscription medicine is going to grow by leaps and bounds over the next 10 years. Consumers will seek to get back the personal side of medicine, something that is increasingly getting lost, and providers will seek the same direct, personal connections without the mess of working with payors. In terms of models of care, subscription medicine is the [best example of aligned incentives][7].

    There are a few things to note about the examples above. First, noticeably absent from the list are hospitals and health systems. It's not that health systems don't see these changes and growing threats, it's that [they are just too slow][8], and too poorly setup, to change. And, with the growth of consumer-based initiatives by all of the above, the erosion of the relationship between provider and patient is only accelerating the displacement of providers and the validity of the argument against MDs as PCPs and providers; it's a vicious cycle and providers are the major losers.

    The second thing to note is that this is a winner take all situation. Consumers, the group notorious for downloading then never using health apps, will not use multiple care management platforms from their drug company, insurance company, and local pharmacy. They prefer to use one platform for everything,  just as they now use the one app from their bank or an aggregator like Mint instead of using multiple apps from each specific financial institution they interact with. There's a lot of money for the winner. This is high stakes.

    So where does that leave health systems? From the list above, almost everything is focused on chronic care. Health systems, and MDs as providers, will continue to own high acuity care and the exceptional specialization that is now required for that care. The real risk is that whichever segment wins the consumer will control, either through human providers or AI-assisted clinical decision support, when patients are sent to providers and which providers they are sent to for high acuity care.

    This shift offers huge opportunities for care management technologies with the right partners. Some sectors and companies will build everything in-house while others will look to buy products and platforms. The companies that succeed will offer ready-to-implement systems with a mix of technology and services. In order for any of the above groups to succeed, the focus on consumers and end users has to be a super strategic initiative, not just about buying an app or platform but a complete suite of solutions and aligning the business at the highest level to accomplish the goals.

    ## 2017 Trend #4: Healthcare Cost Challenges

    Critics of the US healthcare system often cite studies and WHO reports that rate US healthcare outcomes and spending per person against those same statistics from other countries. According to the data and reports, we overspend for bad outcomes. This is a fair conclusion from the data. The problem with the data and reports is we overspend on healthcare in the US, to the tune of [$10,345 per person](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-peak-us-health-care-spending-10345-per-person/) per year, while we grossly underspend on social services. Our healthcare system serves as a safety net for the lack of social programs we provide. Since the healthcare system is our safety net, we constantly just put bandaids on problems and donâ€™t ever try, because we donâ€™t every have the incentives, to solve them.

    Whether itâ€™s our education system that cuts physical activities in place of test prep, our lack of services for homeless and mentally ill, our lack of services to help poor families to access healthy food, or our lack of assistance to families caring for elderly parents ([close to 40% of our population](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/rs/en/rsm12348usen/RSM12348USEN.PDF)), the result is that the US health system has to deal with a myriad of problems, and the associated costs of those problems, whose causes have nothing to do with the healthcare system.

    ## Reducing Costs and Improving Outcomes

    The tide in the industry is changing with an increasing acknowledgment that healthcare bears the brunt of the costs for our lack of social services. In the quest to reduce costs and improve outcomes in healthcare, at some point we need to examine some of the factors that are not under the control of the healthcare system and consider how best to solve those problems, not just the symptoms of those problems. This is not a political issue (or at least it shouldnâ€™t be), itâ€™s an economic one that has to be addressed if weâ€™re going to achieve the triple aim in healthcare.

    We will start to see more and more partnering between healthcare organizations (payers, life sciences, pharmacies, and providers) and community groups and programs. Like all things healthcare, it will be slow and grant funded initially to prove out pilots. Over time, integration of different entities will increase and we will start to see healthcare as a lot more than just doctors, nurses, payers, and life sciences.
