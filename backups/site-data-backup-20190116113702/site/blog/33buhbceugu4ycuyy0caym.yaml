:summary: Here's what we know about Shellshock vulnerability, and how it affects your
  usage of BaaS.
:blog_lead: 'As you''re likely aware, [CVE-2014-6271](http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about.html)
  or "Shellshock" was made public in the last 24 hours. Considered by many to be a
  vulnerability of Heartbleed proportions or greater, security analysts and programmers
  sprung into action to begin to fix the problem. Here''s what we know and how it
  affects your usage of BaaS:

'
:post: "1. **No piece of code which operates BaaS has access to bash or can possibly
  run bash.** No CGI Scripts. Nothing.\r\n2. This doesn't mean that we aren't still
  cautious. We applied current system updates to BaaS servers for both Ubuntu and
  bash, but while this prevented certain Shellshock exploit user cases, it did not
  prevent all of them. *Again, this doesn't affect BaaS.* However, for other software
  which you might be running this might not necessarily be true. Upstream developers
  from bash have not yet published a patch, so be wary as a developer: there is no
  definitive fix to Shellshock just yet.\r\n3. We run and monitor IDS on all of our
  servers for BaaS, but this caught IDS vendors and solutions by surprise too. We
  don't believe there have been any attempts to exploit Shellshock against BaaS, but
  we'll continue to monitor our logs for any suspicious activity. However, any attempts
  would fail since none of the code which runs BaaS has access to bash.\r\n\r\nWhen
  an authorized patch from bash and Ubuntu are available, we will apply those patches
  to our BaaS servers. At that time we will provide you with an all clear. Any updates
  regarding Shellshock and BaaS will be posted here on the blog.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  sticking with us. Since PHI is stored on BaaS, it is our responsibility to protect
  your data. We're always proactively working to protect your data, and you can read
  more about how we do that here: [Catalyze Policy](https://catalyze.io/policy/)\r\n\r\nThank
  you, \r\n\r\nThe Catalyze Team\r\n"
