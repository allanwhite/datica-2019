  "Healthcare is an industry in the midst of transitioning to the cloud, and AWS is strategically positioned to service the healthcare industry's computing needs. AWS's work with Datica, a company that focuses on meeting healthcare's unique compliance needs through security frameworks like HITRUST, helps position AWS to play a key role in the health industry's transformation," said Josh Hofmann, Global Lead, Partner Ecosystem, Amazon Web Services, Inc.

  ## Cofounder Dr. Travis Good Featured in Becker's and Practice Mentors

  Is health IT really 'digital snake oil?' Eight industry leaders, including Dr. Travis Good, reacted to Dr. James Madara's speech and were featured in Becker's Health IT & CIO Review. Dr. Madara[ made the comparison][7] in his address at the 2016 AMA Annual Meeting. "From ineffective EHRs to an explosion of direct-to-consumer digital health products to apps, some of which are poor quality — this is the digital snake oil of the 21st century," he said. But not all stakeholders share Dr. Madara's criticism of the digital health landscape. Dr. Travis Good, among other healthcare stakeholders weighed in on "digital snake oil," and whether that's a fair description of the digital health landscape in [Becker's recent publication][8].

  As we all should know, compliance is mandatory. So stop and think about how many electronic devices you use everyday. Are they all HIPAA compliant? Are you assuming that others take care of that for you? Dr. Travis Good had the pleasure of being featured in the [Practice Mentors Podcast: Electronic Devices And HIPAA Compliance Is Mandatory][9]. You may be surprised as you listen to Travis Good and Kathleen Mills discuss the finer points of this topic. You'll want to know these safeguards to protect yourself from unwanted trouble that could end your practice.
