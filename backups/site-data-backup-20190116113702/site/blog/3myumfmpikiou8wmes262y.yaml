:summary: A review of the HITRUST RightStart Program that's specifically built to
  make it easier and more economical for startups to achieve HITRUST CSF certification.
:blog_lead: "Proving HIPAA compliance is hard for startups. It takes time, energy
  and money to develop a new digital health product that is HIPAA compliant. However,
  just saying your product is HIPAA compliant isn’t enough to actually bring it to
  market. Today’s startups need to be able to provide definitive validation and proof
  in the form of HITRUST CSF certification. \n"
:post: "HITRUST is an industry-driven attempt to create a prescriptive, standardized,
  repeatable compliance framework that all organizations in healthcare can trust.
  Now, HITRUST has launched the [RightStart Program](https://hitrustalliance.net/new-hitrust-program-help-start-ups-information-privacy-security/)
  that's specifically built to make it easier and more economical for startups to
  achieve HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nSince day one, we at Datica have been focused
  on security and HIPAA compliance and we aren't reaching when we say _[It's in our
  DNA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/)_. For us, being HITRUST CSF certified has always
  been a differentiator though achieving it the first time around, as a startup ourselves,
  was an intensive process. \n\n> The process to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification
  can be confusing and resource-intensive for a startup. I’m excited to be a mentor
  for the new HITRUST RightStart Program to help simplify the process for startups
  going through the program. Making HITRUST more accessible to small organizations
  and helping them to anchor their compliance programs on HITRUST is a big win for
  the industry.”   [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/)\n\nTo understand
  this newest HITRUST program, it's important to know where [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/)
  came from. After HIPAA was passed into law in 1996, the following decade or so was
  a confusing, disorganized morass in which the HIPAA Security Rule did not provide
  prescriptive measures for covered entities (CE) and [business associates (BA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
  \n\nBasically, these organizations were given the flexibility to implement comprehensive
  information security programs and analyze their own levels of risk — something many
  healthcare organizations had no experience with. So even those who did have programs
  had ones that were significantly less robust than they needed.\n\nIn 2007, leaders
  within the healthcare field — including CIOs, security and privacy officers from
  leading healthcare providers, insurers and vendors — came together to solve this
  problem. HITRUST initially developed an information security framework with the
  intentions of creating an industry standard, including control baselines so an organization
  could make their own choice based on their unique needs. Originally referred to
  as the [HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework),
  the CSF was developed specifically for healthcare — designed to be scalable, customizable
  and capable of providing certifiable risk assurances.\n\nToday, the HITRUST CSF
  is the most widely adopted information privacy and security risk management framework
  among healthcare organizations in the United States. In addition, many organizations
  outside of the U.S. have also implemented the HITRUST CSF.\n\n## What is the HITRUST
  RightStart Program?\n\nIn a nutshell, HITRUST is bundling and pricing its programs
  to align with the needs of startups. This new program aims to make it easier and
  more economical for startups to achieve HITRUST CSF certification which, in turn,
  will help them navigate their way to market with effective information privacy and
  security programs.\n\n### What’s Included?\n\n* __The HITRUST CSF__. A framework
  that includes thirty-five different resources, such as NIST, HIPAA, and GDPR. The
  HITRUST CSF is a way for digital health organizations to prove compliance within
  one single comprehensive and harmonized assessment. \n* __The HITRUST CSF Assurance
  Program__. Delivers assessment and reporting against the framework of the HITRUST
  CSF. \n* __The HITRUST MyCSF Assessment Platform__. The MyCSF SaaS platform provides
  startups with a purposefully designed and engineered solution for performing and
  managing risk assessments. \n* __The HITRUST Academy__. Training courses that teach
  information protection best practices and how to manage risk with the HITRUST CSF.\n\n###
  Who Can Participate?\n \nA HITRUST RightStart Program participating organization
  must have all of the following.\n \n1. Been incorporated or founded within the last
  three years \n2. Have a productive service line, or be close \n3. Have less than
  50 full-time employees\n4. Have less than $10M in revenue\n\nVisit [HITRUST](https://hitrustalliance.net/right-start-program/)

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :summary: 'As demonstrated in many ways here at Datica, there is a clear ROI with
    leveraging HITRUST as your anchoring compliance framework. '
  :blog_lead: 'At Datica, we’ve written extensively about the [cost of HITRUST](https://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification).
    The truth is, it’s an expensive process — not just the first time you do it but
    on an ongoing basis. To maintain a HITRUST Certification takes a lot of people
    hours and [real dollars for 3rd party assessors](https://hitrustalliance.net/csf-assessors/)
    and to HITRUST itself. That said, there is a [clear ROI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-truth-about-hitrust-and-why-it-should-become-the-industry-standard/)
    with leveraging HITRUST as your anchoring compliance framework.

'
  :post: "\nIn the past, we have only considered the external ROI of HITRUST which,
    for Datica at least, meant differentiation in the market, speed to close and implement
    new deals, and a general trust factor that would typically be reserved for larger
    organizations. A recurring topic of discussion at the HITRUST conference last
    month was the different forms of ROI for HITRUST, with internal ROI being discussed
    at length by many organizations, large and small. I quickly came to realize that
    the ROI for HITRUST is just as much internal as it is external. \n\nLet me explain
    in the context of Datica.\n\nAt Datica, we built our initial compliance program,
    from policies through implementation (link to academy post on maturity model),
    for healthcare and specifically to meet HITRUST CSF controls. This was five years
    ago. We’ve since leveraged the HITRUST CSF for [SOC2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/soc-2-type-ii-compliance-for-cloud-computing/)
    and most recently [GDPR assessments](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/gdpr-compliance/).
    As the HITRUST CSF has matured, our compliance posture has matured along with
    it. And the entire process of working with HITRUST has shaped all of our internal
    activities, from product to marketing and sales.\n\nTo fully appreciate the internal
    ROI we get from HITRUST, the example of our new product design and development
    serves to highlight how HITRUST permeates all areas of Datica. We decided in 2017
    to develop a [new product based on Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    We did this because the market was increasingly interested in Kubernetes and the
    offerings from cloud providers like AWS were not covered under a BAA (currently
    none of the major Kubernetes services available are HITRUST Certified except for
    Datica’s). In developing our Kubernetes roadmap, we started with a list of HITRUST
    controls we had to meet to comply with our policies and certifications. We then
    used this set of controls to ensure we implemented the proper technology around
    Kubernetes — networking, backup, IDS, container security, certificates, etc. The
    product requirements, based on HITRUST, were unambiguous to our product and engineering
    teams, and it was a light lift for our security and compliance people to sign
    off.\n\nEven our sales and marketing people leverage the HITRUST maturity model
    to differentiate our products from our competitors in the market.\n\nOther examples
    are the recent free guides we published on how to secure common managed cloud
    databases to comply with HITRUST. The specific HITRUST controls are listed with
    each step. Here is the [AWS RDS guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/).\n\nHITRUST
    trickles down to all people at Datica. It takes away the subjective “the security
    officer says this,” and instead provides a published set of controls. This is
    hard to quantify with a dollar value but [it is a significant ROI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/).
    What is interesting is that these examples, and this theme, were repeated time
    and time again at the [HITRUST conference](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-2018-a-fantastic-event/).
    \n\nLooking forward, we are aligning our internal compliance structure and compliance
    operations even more around HITRUST. We are currently in the process of re-writing
    our policies and procedures (look for an announcement with new open source tools
    soon) and we are doing it with each compliance action and activity mapped to specific
    HITRUST controls. We are doing this to give us a constant set of guardrails and
    to ease the burden, both to us and our assessors, of our annual HITRUST assessments.

    into the topic of how healthcare compliance has evolved in the cloud era. '
  :blog_lead: In 2013, when the final HIPAA Omnibus was ruled, compliance on the cloud
    was an opaque understanding. It took collaboration among cloud services providers
    such as AWS, Azure, and Google, digital health companies like Datica, and the
    good folks at HITRUST and Coalfire (among many deserving others) to collectively
    define what it meant.
  :post: |2

    The process has been hard. Along the way, we learned a lot while also building little mental models or explanations to help distill the evolving complexity into digestible chunks for those looking to make a dent in this industry. Many of those simplifications we put into our new book, [*Complete Cloud Compliance*](https://completecloudcompliance.com), which launched this month.

    The book tries to answer the question "What Really Is Compliance?" and we think we do a decent job for those who aren't a professional compliance officer. The concepts are familiar to those with deep compliance experience, but we believe are the most efficient explainer for those who truly aren't sure how to answer the question themselves. We thought, if we can help everyone else learn our compliance lessons over the past five years, we can make *our* dent in this industry.

    On Wednesday, September 26th, I'll be giving [a webinar where I dive deeper](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/webinars/what-really-is-compliance/) into the topic. I will be summarizing many key concepts throughout the book. For those who have 45 minutes open over lunchtime, I encourage you to attend.

    A few big ideas we will explore tomorrow:

    * Compliance is not the same as security is not the same as privacy
    * Rules and controls are very different, and it's important to understand that
    * The faster you can map the difference between organizations, standards, frameworks, and regulations, the faster all these acronyms will make sense to you
    * The global nature of compliance
    * Why frameworks matter
    * How to map a compliance regime onto your cloud architecture

    Please join me on Wednesday. Feedback is always welcome!

  :blog_lead: The HITRUST Conference in 2018 was different. Not evolutionarily different
    from previous years, but drastically different. And in good ways. Everything,
    from the venue to the sessions to the attendees, was impressive. HITRUST did a
    great job updating this conference into a fantastic event.
  :post: |2

    ## HITRUST 2018 was all about the cloud

    In terms of the content, the major change was the focus on cloud. We’ve been attending the conference for four years and I feel like Datica (Catalyze at the time) was the only organization talking about the cloud at the HITRUST conference four years ago. Almost every session I attended this year was focused on the cloud or had the cloud as the underlying context for the session. This reflects the broader shift in the market but is well timed for HITRUST as most attendees were beginning their journeys to the cloud and doing it with HITRUST as the anchoring framework for that journey.

    ## New HITRUST Shared Responsibility Program

    Along those same lines, HITRUST is working hard to embrace the cloud and announced its [Shared Responsibility Program]( https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-program-addresses-security-risks-inefficiencies-leveraging-cloud-service-providers/) this week to coincide with the conference. Shared Responsibility is tied directly to compliance on the cloud as vendors work with CSPs, SaaS vendors, and other cloud platform companies offering solutions for various aspects of infrastructure. It is good to see HITRUST pushing this forward by offering a Shared Responsibility Program that I hope will extend and add value to the [shared responsibility models](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) currently in existence from cloud vendors.

    The sessions themselves, both the breakout and the main room sessions, were well thought out and the speakers I saw were good. Most of the speakers had real-world experience with the topics they were discussing, something I don’t always see at conferences. Engagement from attendees was good as well; most sessions had a healthy amount of interaction between speakers and the audience.

    ## Smaller organizations were featured

    One thing I particularly appreciated about the event was the sessions that involved smaller organizations. Four years ago, the speakers I remember were either from HITRUST or from large payors. This year’s event featured many speakers from smaller entities, [Datica included](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/events/hitrust-2018/). This reflects the goal of HITRUST to engage the smaller end of the market, from startups to growth stage vendors, looking to anchor on a compliance framework, which is smart because the agility of smaller organizations means that is where a lot of innovation is currently found. I think educating vendors is the best way to get them to adopt HITRUST and to ultimately help HITRUST become a de-facto standard across both sides of the market—large enterprises and their vendors or partners.

    ## The Complete Cloud Compliance book was introduced

    <img class="lozad float-right" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=400" src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/1FgejTHp2I4owc84SQa8mW/78ff54d79f2c40b6f70bb5e96c7a6efb/compliance-book-pages-thumb.png?fm=jpg&w=200&q=20" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance" width="200" />

    On a personal note, we launched our book [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com/) this week and were offering free, and sometimes signed, copies for conference attendees. Underscoring the theme of cloud this week, the response to the book was huge. We underestimated demand for the book and had to overnight additional copies to ensure we had some for the final day of the conference. We are now out of books, but will have more in the coming weeks. [Sign up to get a download of chapter 2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/) of the book now, and to be notified when general purchase is available on Amazon.com.

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
