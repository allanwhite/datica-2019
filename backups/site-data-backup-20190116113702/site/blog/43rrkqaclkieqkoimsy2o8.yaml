:summary: In the 377 healthcare data breaches last year, phishing attacks were among
  the top data breach causes. Why is healthcare such a target for spear phishing attacks?
:blog_lead: "At the beginning of August, the BBC reported that a UK-based “prankster”
  had successfully [spoofed the White House.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40788080)
  Through spear phishing emails, this bad actor had not only convinced a senior cyber
  security officer that he was the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared
  Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to
  fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory
  email exchanges. After posting a few of those emails on Twitter, the culprit promised
  not to do it again and urged the current administration to “tighten up IT policy.”
  While the jokester later indicated his email spoofing had no harmful intent, the
  implications go way beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n"
:post: "Phishing is a widely used form of social engineering where malicious ne’re-do-wells
  broadcast  disguised emails to a large population in an attempt to steal sensitive
  information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
  not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with the
  term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America Online
  (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked themselves
  as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and Ebay. These fraudulent
  emails would often persuade victims to open a link with a malevolent attachment
  or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing scams bred a more targeted
  type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
  For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
  if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
  someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
  subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
  Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches last
  year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
  report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
  hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches. Furthermore,
  spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting CEOs. From 2015
  to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent. In the first
  part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health, Torrance
  Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according to Healthcare
  IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
  This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
  With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
  spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
  Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica Security
  Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear phishing:
  high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for ransomware
  and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security walls
  when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what they
  want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization, is
  also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing attempt
  that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one of our executive’s
  email addresses. He or she used that email address to request a wire transfer from
  the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the department head alerted
  the appropriate person within Datica about the email and its request, and ultimately
  averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example to warn its own customers to
  such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare
  organizations can better protect themselves from such attacks. Her recommendations
  and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n### Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll
  employees need to be made aware of what phishing is and the damage that can result
  from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines the steps he uses to fully inform Datica
  employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing email looks like, explaining how to evaluate
  such an email and then confirming that employees know to whom suspicious emails
  should be forwarded for evaluation are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions
  that could breach an organization’s thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic
  testing of employees’ knowledge and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting
  internal spear phishing lures that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions
  against doing testing at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular
  that on October 1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals.
  \n\n### Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in
  place as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is
  trying to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should
  have the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
  Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then managing
  any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program “Having
  zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational goal,”
  says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation steps.”
  \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in HITRUST. Datica
  joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States to achieve [HITRUST
  CSF Certification](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) status and believes
  that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is the best way to protect
  its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity and compliance are
  deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica.com/). If you’ve ever
  had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment on the Datica
  platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of double verification.
  The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing department to quickly
  verify and make customer requested adjustments for access. Datica utilizes stringent
  measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers. These steps combined with
  the recommendations above better protect your organization for a spear phishing
  attack. \n"

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica.com/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica.com/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica.com/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: Private, Public, and Hybrid clouds all exist in healthcare. Hybrid clouds
    represent the largest area of growth in healthcare organizations.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

    <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">
    <img src="https://images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1OrH0GVvn2iAaqGuOMi66U/65b0f7f0407c6229bca3561517303c53/report-infographic-preview-sq.jpg?w=300" alt="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" class="float-right" width="150" >
    </a>

    We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
  :post: |+
    ## Shift to IaaS

    For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

    Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

    The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

    * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
    * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

    That's a remarkable jump.

    ## Data Data Everywhere

    The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

    Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

    Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

    ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

    What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

    The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

    The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

    ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

    |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
    |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
    |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
    |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
    |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
    |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

    ## What this means to healthcare

    We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

    We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.

    With the modern boom of laptop, smartphone and tablet usage being witnessed across

    more important than ever. Since medical workers can connect near instantaneously
    to obtain medical information sought after, primary care workflows can be expedited,
    but what does this mean for data security?
  :post: |-
    Risks always follow new technologies. For instance, a tablet may be easily stolen or misplaced. If that tablet has the personal information of several hundred patients stored on it, the unknown whereabouts could lead to lawsuit settlements with insurmountable financial repercussions. Therefore, hospitals must be wary about how they are collecting, storing and protecting the information on their patients.

    Storing data on mobile devices does make it easier to access data, but it also increases the risk of the same data falling into wrong hands if the device is misplaced. It really does not matter much if the data on the device was encrypted or not. Patients (and the judicial system) care more about the actual loss of personal information rather than the loss of the technology itself on which the information was stored. Therefore, being able to protect data itself is a much better proposition for ensuring the safety of patient records. Putting data on secure cloud applications is one way of minimizing risks from theft, provided it cannot be downloaded into any type of computer.

    Cloud service providers that store data securely in multiple places minimize the risk of data loss due to catastrophic natural disasters, sabotage or destruction. Redundancy is assured when the healthcare information is stored on primary database servers along with a backup database server. Providers ensure that customer's data can be replicated to database servers in real-time during disaster recovery operations.

    For healthcare services to attain this level of data, security would turn out to be extremely expensive and administratively very difficult. It would detract from the healthcare provider's primary functionality of caring for their patients. However, when a cloud service provider offers security, it is less expensive as the implementation is usually on a large scale. On one hand, the healthcare industry gets security at affordable prices and on the other, it is not burdened with maintaining a service that is not its core strength.

    Although the cloud hosts and protects medical information, the control remains with the hospital. With support from the cloud service provider, hospitals can ensure a role-based security system for accessing the data. Users can have different levels of access based on their roles within the hospital's organization. Security breaches become easier to prevent, as specific people now require different levels of security clearance. The hospital can choose to employ role-based security for preventing an employee from unwittingly altering or accessing information that he or she is not permitted to because of their specific function.

    From their side, cloud service providers offer a host of security features that their customers can utilize. For ensuring compliance to HIPAA, there are password complexity requirements, verification questions and session lockouts. Providers typically store user passwords with one-way hashing algorithms, while logging user entries with date, time and source IP address. The logs are maintained for a minimum of 30 days to ensure tracking and security.

    The emergence of HIPAA-compliant cloud storage has raised the bar of providing a complete solution for improved performance and security for the service providers. The improved access to information stored on HIPAA-compliant cloud simplifies switching and leads to more savings for the medical facilities.

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    is HITRUST?](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/)\n* [What is the HITRUST
    Framework?](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework)\n* [The Purpose

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
