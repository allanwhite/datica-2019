:summary: 'A new HIMSS report about the state of clinical communication and workflow
  explores how stakeholders in the healthcare system are using and plan to use mHealth,
  or mobile clinical communications tools. '
:blog_lead: "The new reality of today’s technology-enabled world — one where more
  people have smartphones than don’t — is that we all expect access to everything,
  from anywhere, anytime. This expectation exists in all aspects of our lives, and
  holds true for providers and their patients who [both want an fast way to communicate
  and easy access to health data](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/mapping-digital-health-validic-drew-schiller/).
  \ \n\nFor the most part, the technology industry has risen to the challenge, providing
  us with the ability to do nearly everything on our phones. This digital transformation
  is happening at warp speed almost everywhere, except in healthcare, where mobile
  health, or mHealth, lags behind and the industry struggles to move beyond the [digital
  health hype](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/).
  \ "
:post: "\nA paper titled [“The State of Clinical Communication & Workflow”](https://www.patientsafesolutions.com/resources/whitepapers/state-of-clinical-communication-workflow/)
  produced by HIMSS Media in partnership with HIMSS Analytics and PatientSafe Solutions
  explores how stakeholders in the healthcare system are using and plan to use mobile
  clinical communications tools. \n\n## Current condition of mHealth\n\nTo say that
  the state of mHealth is fragmented is almost an understatement. With IT professionals,
  clinicians, and even different departments within the same organization wanting
  and expecting varying solutions from mobile devices and applications, finding effective
  mHealth programs is rare. \n\nThe survey shows that the main use of mobile technology
  in healthcare is for communication, rather than accessing patient data, sending
  alerts, or as a diagnostics tool. In one sense, the use of mobile technology primarily
  as a communication tool makes sense, but it also means there’s an enormous amount
  of untapped potential. \n\nDepending on who you ask, mhealth should be doing different
  things. IT professionals expect mhealth to provide:\n\n- HIPAA compliant messaging\n-
  Consolidation of voice and messaging\n- Integration with the delivery of results
  and alerts\n\nHowever, clinicians have a different set of expectations:\n\n- Improved
  patient safety\n- Faster response among teams\n- Faster response to patients\n\nIn
  some ways, those expectations are related. For example, integrating the delivery
  of results and alerts could improve patient safety, and a good messaging system
  that is HIPAA compliant could result in faster response times from team members.
  The interesting thing is that these basic functions are not yet widely available.
  \n\nThe report notes:\n\n> The survey shows that the vast majority of both clinicians
  and IT want to see strong integration of workflow and communications capabilities
  within a unified application, which potentially makes it the strongest driver for
  ongoing adoption. However, for the most part, that hasn’t happened, primarily because
  of product limitations.”\n\n## Secure messaging may be available but inconvenient\n\nAs
  it is now, most organizations do have secure messaging platforms available to clinicians.
  But, in many cases they are so unwieldy they are difficult to use. Nurses, particularly,
  often have to juggle multiple devices, which could include handsets, voice badges,
  pagers, and phones. Physicians are more likely to have smartphones, but even so,
  may have to use multiple apps to send messages making it more likely they will use
  the phone’s native SMS app and send unsecured messages creating potential HIPAA
  violations. \n\n> A full 39% of clinical staff indicate unsecure messaging is happening
  even when secure messaging is in place. Everyone has their own cell phone. If the
  care team can’t easily reach each other with the hospital-provided devices and apps,
  they’ll use whatever is fastest to take care of their patients.” \n\nThe majority
  of healthcare professionals would like to see better integration of secure communications
  and clinical workflow. The survey results showed that 75% of respondents felt “the
  communication solution(s) and clinical applications at my organization aren’t adequately
  integrated to support clinical workflows” and 77% “indicated they would like their
  communications solution(s) to integrate with clinical workflow management and documentation.”
  \n\nEven within a single organization, different departments may be using different
  communications tools. The problem is wide-reaching across the industry as well as
  deep — extending through organizations. However, there are factors that could make
  now the best time for a change. \n\n## The potential of mHealth\n\nAlthough the
  majority of professionals who responded to the survey were concerned with the use
  of mhealth for secure communications, mobile applications hold the potential for
  much more, particularly if [integration with electronic health records (EHRs)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/)
  and clinical workflows can be achieved. \n\nThe top three areas that professionals
  indicated are currently unfilled include: \n\n1. Communicating results across care-setting
  boundaries \n2. Proper post discharge follow-up coordination\n3. Patient data access
  anywhere, anytime\n\nEach of those areas could impact things like hospital readmissions,
  chronic condition care, and patient participation in their own care, all of which
  are part of value-based care. There’s a strong case for making mHealth a priority
  right now. \n\n## Why now is the right time for mHealth\n\nWith so much uncertainty
  and impending change in the industry, now might not seem like the best time to tackle
  the problems of mobile communications in healthcare, but it is, for multiple reasons.
  In some cases, older devices are ready to be replaced, and the move toward value-based
  care may be better-accomplished with a good mobile strategy in place. \n\nThe report
  advises making a particular mobile device, along with [an infrastructure](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
  and some “marquee applications” the backbone of the mobile strategy, then building
  from there. Such a strategy will allow healthcare organizations to move from patient-level
  care all the way to population health. \n\nThere are challenges. Among them:\n\n-
  Lack of existing infrastructure\n- Systems integration issues\n- Too many devices\n-
  Too many applications\n- Lack of interoperability\n- Fragmentation within organizations\n\nThere
  are smart mHealth and digital health solutions, though, and choosing applications
  built on a [secure, HIPAA-compliant platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/), like
  the many application developers who have chosen Datica, is a smart first step. \n"

  :summary: 'Are digital health apps consumer-facing, or used in a clinical setting?
    How are they improving patient outcomes? How are digital health apps integrated
    into clinicians’ workflows? '
  :blog_lead: "Digital health is something of a buzzword in the industry right now,
    but evidence is emerging that digital health apps have the potential to both improve
    patient outcomes and [save money across the healthcare system](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/digital-health-apps-could-save-7-billion/).
    \n\n"
  :post: "## What is a Digital Health Application? \n\nMobile health, or mHealth,
    is a type of digital health and is used within the larger context of what the
    World Health Organization (WHO) describes as electronic health. Apps, of course,
    are designed to be used with mobile devices.\n\nOne of the largest barriers for
    health organizations to adopting mHealth in past has been the issue of [changing
    reimbursement models](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/changing-reimbursement-means-new-opportunities/).
    Healthcare has been a fee-for-service business — essentially providers earned
    money when people needed care — but now policymakers are shifting to a value-based
    system. In a value-based system, keeping patients healthy will result in more
    earnings. \n\nPopulation health, care for chronic conditions, reducing hospital
    readmissions, and other methods of keeping people well are more important in a
    value-based care system than in a fee-for-service system. Digital health apps
    can enhance value-based care through things like appointment reminders, patient
    monitoring for those with chronic conditions, and various other functions that
    can improve the overall health of a given community or patient population. \n\nAre
    digital health apps consumer-facing, or used in a clinical setting? How are they
    improving patient outcomes? How are digital health apps integrated into clinicians’
    workflows? \n\n## 11 Types of Digital Health Tools\n\nData firm IQVIA lists 11
    specific categories of digital health tools in their report [The Growing Value
    of Digital Healthcare](: \n\n1. Consumer Mobile Apps\n2. Consumer Wearables\n3.
    Connected Biometric Sensors\n4. Smartphone Cameras\n5. Clinical Trial Patient
    Information Collection Tools\n6. In-Home Connected Virtual Assistants\n7. Telemedicine
    and Virtual Physician Visits\n8. Personal Health Records\n9. Web-based Interactive
    Programs\n10. Text Messaging or Email\n11. Health System Disease Management Apps\n\nIn
    the IQVIA definition, digital health is mHealth. \n\n> The term is used throughout
    this report as meaning the use of connected mobile devices — including, but not
    limited to, mobile phones, tablets, consumer wearables, connected biosensors,
    and in-home virtual assistants — to improve health.”  \n\nNo set definition has
    been settled on for mHealth, but many are quite similar. \n\n## What Defines mHealth?
    \n\nThere are a few [different definitions for mhealth](http://www.himss.org/definitions-mhealth)
    in use, but nearly all of them agree that mobile health includes a variety of
    apps and devices. Here’s a small selection of definitions for mHealth by various
    organizations:  \n\n* Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH):
    “mHealth is ‘the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices’”
    \n* The mHealth Alliance: “mHealth stands for mobile-based or mobile-enhance solutions
    that deliver health. The ubiquity of mobile devices in the developed or developing
    world presents the opportunity to improve health outcomes through the delivery
    of innovative medical and health services with information and communication technologies
    to the farthest reaches of the globe.” \n* WHO: “Mobile Health (mHealth) is an
    area of electronic health (eHealth) and it is the provision of health services
    and information via mobile technologies such as mobile phones and Personal Digital
    Assistants (PDAs).” \n\n## Examples of companies innovating in the mHealth space\n\nThe
    Datica Platform serves as the compliance and data foundation for hundreds of customers
    developing breakthrough apps in the mHealth space. Here are just a few examples
    of our customers who are mHealth innovators.\n\n### CareMessage\n\n[CareMessage](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/caremessage/#spotlight)
    technology allows for automated appointment reminders for some of the most at-risk
    patient populations. The technology takes three critical factors into account:
    the patient’s precondition symptoms, their language preferences, and how they
    want to receive messages. \n\nAutomated appointment reminders for those who use
    the so-called safety net of the American healthcare system reduces the cost of
    missed appointments, improves patient/provider relationships, and improves health
    literacy. \n\n### Purple Binder\n\nDesigned to help hospital social workers find
    the resources their clients need, [Purple Binder](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/purple-binder/#spotlight)
    seeks to bridge the gap between social and economic services and healthcare services.
    They are currently working to build a messaging portal that will allow the hospitals
    and social services organizations connect when patients are referred. \n\n###
    healthfinch\n\nWhile many problems in the healthcare system involve patient services,
    some of them center around healthcare providers. For example, physician burnout
    is a huge problem, and one reason for it is ever-increasing burden of clerical
    work. [Healthfinch](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/healthfinch/) automates some of
    the mundane and repeatable tasks that physicians often sacrifice time that would
    otherwise be spent with patients to complete. "

  :summary: 'The January, 2018 draft of the Trusted Exchange Framework is the first
    real step toward interoperability since the Cures Act was passed. '
  :blog_lead: 'One of the biggest obstacles to using electronic health data to the
    fullest potential is the lack of interoperability. At every level of healthcare,
    the lack of interoperability causes problems: patients cannot easily access their
    own health data, providers have problems accessing the health information of new
    patients, researchers cannot access the data necessary to identify trends that
    would improve population health, and technology companies struggle to compete
    in a closed marketplace. '
  :post: "The [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text),
    sometimes referred to as the Cures Act, which was passed in December 2016, identifies
    the need for interoperability. Interoperability would make the exchange of personal
    health information (PHI) possible while still maintaining security. Currently,
    information is siloed within EHR systems, and [data integration with those EHRs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/integration/)
    is frequently cited issue for healthcare providers. \n\nAlongside the need for
    various stakeholders to be able to access information, there is the requirement
    to follow the dictates of the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/). Information needs
    to be accessible, but must also remain secure. Through the Cures Act, Congress
    instructed the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to create or support the
    creation of a framework for health information networks (HINs) to exchange health
    information through a common agreement. \n\n## What is The Trusted Exchange Framework?\n\nThe
    draft Trusted Exchange Framework is the first step toward interoperability. The
    ONC has published a [User’s Guide to Understanding the Draft Trusted Exchange
    Framework](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-guide.pdf). The
    document was released on January 5, 2018, and consists of two parts:\n\nPart A
    - Principles for Trusted Exchange\nPart B - Minimum Required Terms and Conditions
    for Trusted Exchange\n\nStakeholders are [encouraged to submit comments](https://beta.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement)
    through February 20, 2018. Once comments have been submitted and a final version
    agreed upon, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) will
    be published in the Federal Register. The ONC expects the final version to be
    published by late 2018. \n\nThe stakeholders include: \n\n* Health information
    networks\n* Federal agencies\n* Public health organizations\n* Individuals\n*
    Payers\n* Providers\n* Technology developers\n\nOne of the most important goals
    of the Trusted Exchange Framework is to create what the ONC describes as “a single
    on-ramp” to interoperability. Currently, healthcare organizations use different
    point-to-point interfaces to exchange PHI with each other. This system requires
    the creation and maintenance of all those individual interfaces, which is expensive
    and inefficient. \n\nCreating one framework for various stakeholders to exchange
    information will simplify the process, make accessing their own PHI easier for
    patients, and create a more competitive market for technology companies. \n\n##
    Two Parts of the Trusted Exchange Framework\n\n### Trusted Exchange Framework
    Part A\n\nThe first part of the Framework is Principles for Trusted Exchange.
    The ONC has defined six principles: \n1. Standardization\n2. Transparency\n3.
    Cooperation and Non-Discrimination\n4. Security and Patient Safety\n5. Access\n6.
    Data-Driven Accountability \n\nThese general principles are described as “guardrails,”
    and the goal of Part A is to build trust among the various HINs. \n\n### Trusted
    Exchange Framework Part B\n\nThe second part of the framework is Minimum Required
    Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. This section creates common practices
    for the exchange of health information, including a common authentication process,
    rules for exchange, and organizational and operational practices. \n\nSpeaking
    to [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/onc-genevieve-morris-trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-interoperability),
    Genevieve Morris, the principal deputy national coordinator for health information
    technology at the ONC said, \n\n> This is just the floor of what those required
    terms and conditions are. We all just have to agree to the same terms in order
    for that exchange to happen.” \n\n## Building on the 3 Goals of Interoperability\n\nThe
    Trusted Exchange Framework builds on the work that the industry has already done
    to advance interoperability. [A press release](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/01/05/draft-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-released-hhs.html)
    from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the draft stresses
    that there are three important goals of interoperability: \n\n1. Patient access
    - patients should be able to easily access their own health information.\n2. Population-level
    data exchange - both providers and payers need access to population-level health
    data in order to analyze trends, outcomes, and costs.\n3. Open and accessible
    APIs - giving the health IT community access to health information will improve
    the entrepreneurial climate, leading to innovation and improved usability. \n\nThe
    ONC will outsource the actual implementation of the framework. The ONC will hold
    an “open and competitive selection of a single Recognized Exchange Framework Entity
    (RCE) from the industry,” wrote Morris in a [blog post on HealthIT Buzz](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-common-sense-approach-achieving-health-information-interoperability/).
    \ \n\nThe RCE will work with the ONC to develop the final version of the TEFCA
    that is published in the Federal Register. \n"

    2018 Healthcare Trends series, I outlined [six trends for 2018](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/).
    I predict volatility as the government, individuals, and private sector demand
    change this year. In this sixth piece of the series, I explore the fifth trend
    — moving beyond the digital health hype.\n\nOver the last ten years, digital health
    has been met with much ballyhoo and corresponding investment. Even the “digital
    health” term has become broad and beyond its original intent. It’s helpful to
    define the term before diving into its evolution and current state. According
    to Wikipedia, [the digital health discipline is described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health)
    in the following way — “The discipline involves the use of information and communication
    technologies to help address the health problems and challenges faced by patients.” "
  :post: "\nThat’s broad. Very broad. \n\nDigital health is somewhat  synonymous with
    “healthcare technology,” with one caveat — healthcare technology is inclusive
    of electronic health records (EHRs) and I personally don’t group EHRs in with
    the broader digital health term.\n\nLike other verticals and in many consumer
    products, digital health has followed a similar trend. We saw initial hype around
    mobility, connectivity and consumerization of healthcare. While those trends are
    still relevant, healthcare, as yet has not been disrupted or upgraded to the same
    extent as industries like banking, retail, and even education. Those who have
    been in healthcare for a while have read a multitude of stories touting new companies
    and technologies that were destined to disrupt healthcare. All of those, except
    a select few, have failed. \n\nHere are a few of the obstacles digital health
    companies must overcome.\n\n## Scrutiny of technology spend is way up and proof
    is the antidote\n\nIn 2018, healthcare technology has finally [moved past the
    EHR era](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/). EHRs
    are now ubiquitous in healthcare organizations. As we all learned at HIMSS18,
    the good old days of Meaningful Use are over. However, one lingering consequence
    of Meaningful Use was an increase of the percentage of technology spend in most
    health systems budgets. That increased spend is now being scrutinized, and digital
    health must demonstrate solid proof of efficacy to overcome that scrutiny and
    succeed.\n\nIn the [Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/)
    Datica outlined the major challenges that digital health developers must traverse.
    Now, more than ever, digital health products need associated proof to overcome
    buyer and customer skepticism. The proof can broadly fall into the following buckets
    — lowering costs, improving care (especially in at-risk settings), and improving
    the care experience.\n\n## VCs invest in scalable technologies, but healthcare
    is siloed and localized \n\nVenture capital compounds the challenges of digital
    health. Building and scaling new technology products to meet venture capital demands
    falls out of alignment with selling and implementing demands of digital health
    within the enterprise. The localized nature of healthcare exacerbates the problem.
    Even for some larger systems that still buy technology at local or regional levels,
    one must wonder if most digital health technologies aren’t meant to be venture
    scale. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSome digital health companies have
    found success with a focus on localization. Those companies have discovered that
    while you may not be able to change the way care is delivered for millions of
    people you can, however, do that in one city. Scale in healthcare doesn’t have
    to be geographically global. Scaling to thousands of health systems is daunting,
    since many are finding ways to solve their problems without waiting for a well-funded
    digital health startup to save the day. \n\nOver the past year, I’ve talked to
    multiple investors who say they see many digital health companies solving the
    same problems with similar solutions, and all at similar stages ($1 - $2 million
    in annual revenue and 2-5 customers in the same geography). Who gets funded and
    how do they scale with anything resembling efficiency?\n\nEHRs don’t help the
    problem of scaling. Without a centralized clinical data repository; thousands
    of EHR silos exist all over the U.S. Selling to one Epic hospital is selling to
    one Epic hospital. You must go through the same extended implementation for each
    new hospital, with all the associated built-in pushback.\n\n## Proof and scale
    are necessary, but are they even possible?\n\nWhere does that leave us? Is there
    a way to 1) prove the ROI of a digital health product, and 2) scale that success
    quickly? I’m not sure. The system seems to be set up to prevent that from happening.
    The biggest companies I know that are strategically focused on getting into digital
    health, and these are some of the biggest companies in the world, are playing
    a very long game. Those companies know that success, at least regarding scale,
    is going to take many, many years. And they have the money and patience to play
    it out.\n\nThese companies are targeting providers because they are seen as the
    key to healthcare as the actual place of the transaction — care delivered and
    care received. Life sciences are sometimes seen as a faster path to success, but
    there are only so many life sciences companies and the investments those companies
    are making in digital health, and their strategies for digital health, are similarly
    long game strategies that involve being closer to care delivery.\n\nDespite the
    doom and gloom of the last few paragraphs, digital health will have a significant
    impact on healthcare. The question is timing. Regardless of the when, the how
    is clear — digital health needs to be able to prove it’s worth to get into the
    hands of patients and providers.\n\n"

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
