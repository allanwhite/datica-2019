:summary: Healthcare enterprises are striving to achieve the “triple threat of patient
  engagement"

  Healthcare enterprises are striving to achieve the “triple threat of patient engagement":

  -  Enhance the patient care experience (quality and gratification)
  -  Improve the general population health
  -  Minimize cost of care
:post: "However, these goals cannot be met, or even neared, without a properly implemented
  patient engagement strategy. \n\nHere are 5 tips we believe are key factors in developing
  a prosperous strategy for any healthcare entity:\n\n### 1. There is no \"One Size
  Fits All\" Patient Engagement Solution\n\nThe new age of healthcare primarily focuses
  on patient engagement as a way to reduce costs. Practically everyone in the industry
  agrees that patient engagement is important, yet there is no consistent solution.
  Engagement paragons cannot be treated as “one size fits all” solutions but instead
  must cover a broader scale of needs tailored towards the segmented needs of the
  populace.\n\n### 2. Recognize Vital Metrics to Continually Gauge ROI\n\nPatient
  engagement solutions and their larger financial initiatives should always be understood
  to maximize on the ROI based on certain factors, such as:\n\n- Progressive Care
  Outcomes\n- Efficiency Reserve Savings\n- Revenue generated from evading further
  surgical services\n- Non-monetary gains — increased patient satisfaction, employee
  engagement, etc.\n- Greater Patient and Provider Education\n\n### 3. Timing is Everything\n\nPatients
  and the general populace fail to remember everything. It has been shown that patients
  only retain near 20% of information provided and 50% of that is remembered erroneously.
  Engage your patients at the right time through the proper channels by feeding modest
  amounts of information to avoid overwhelming patients. Step-by-step documented care
  plans are a great option to implement into your strategy. \n\n### 4. Confirm Compliance
  with HIPAA and Meaningful Use\n\nWhen deciding upon a solution to implement, it
  is essential that providers meet and comply with HIPAA standards. And since most
  patient portal technologies are new, entities fail to understand the implications
  behind non-compliance, especially in relation to secure messaging or data storage.
  Do thorough research on the new Meaningful Use guidelines and ensure your technology
  providers are in adherence. \n\n### 5. Scalable Solutions that Close Gaps in Healthcare\n\nWhen
  a subset of the populace is identified in care, messages must be delivered to the
  patients to notify them of the gap in care and how to provide next steps to close
  this gap. Based on patient preferences, notifications can be channeled through emails,
  texts, patient portals, phone calls, etc. All notifications should have a clear
  call to action and link back to a website or provide a phone number to reach the
  physician’s office. It should be made clear what a patient’s next steps are. Tools
  must allow for automation and high-volume interventions to reach patients in the
  most time-efficient and cost-effective manner."
