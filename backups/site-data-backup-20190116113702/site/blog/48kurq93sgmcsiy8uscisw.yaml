    The Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) is a simple guide for the makers of digital healthcare products.

    The Internet is full of resources to help turn ideas into lean startups or businesses, but things are a little different in the wild wild west of digital health technology. There are considerations in healthcare not found in any other industry, and no one has time to learn them all.

    We’ve simplified the unique complexities to help you get your digital health products from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises. You will leave with a better understanding of how to manage the challenges ahead.

  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAt
  South by Southwest (SXSW) this month, [Datica and Microsoft co-hosted a day-long
  digital health boot camp.](https://datica.com/blog/microsoft-datica-digital-health-bootcamp-at-sxsw/)
  The intent of this boot camp was to provide insights to the entrepreneurs and the
  digital health enthusiasts at SXSW in order to make it easier for new innovations
  and ideas to get off the ground. \n\nAs part of the boot camp, [Kris Gösser, CMO
  of Datica](https://datica.com/about/kris-gosser/), led a high-level overview of
  all the larger challenges, such as HIPAA, that makers of digital health products
  will face as they build out thoughts and ideas into products and get those products
  into the hands of doctors and pharmacists, etc. to actually make an impact. The
  problem is that things are really hard and messy right now in healthcare."
:post: "> ½ of all digital health startups fail within their first two years!”\n\n##
  Defining success and failure in digital health \n\nSo to define success we kind
  of look at it as having a genuine impact with your business on the market. If you
  are, then the ideas that you have in terms of improving patient satisfaction, or
  curing cancer, for example, may let you improve patient outcomes. \n\nIf you aren't
  hitting those things then the definition of failure is more or less you running
  out of money, or your business not getting funding to get your product off the ground.
  \ But more importantly, your innovation is not having a genuine impact on the lives
  of patients.\n\n![blog-sxsw-18-illustration](//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5gqdPRZFwIIoimyECsEASU/471d116fe14cb4a6460765a3c1288205/blog-sxsw-18-illustration.png)\n\n##
  Why half of digital health startups will fail \n\nIt simply comes down to the fact
  that healthcare is a very unique beast. There are challenges within it that you
  will not find in any other industry. And so it's understanding those challenges
  and those blockers that can help give you a shortcut to success. \n\nTo follow,
  are four challenges that are specific to healthcare. \n\n### Incentives\n\nThe payor
  is the insurance company and often they are the ones that dictate which sort of
  innovations are the ones that are going to be deployed within health systems. And
  that's because there is a complex and convoluted way in which the payers actually
  pay for services and technology. Historically, healthcare has been what's called
  pay-for-service or fee-for-service and that means that essentially when a practitioner
  does a job that practitioner can file via a code somewhere and get paid for that.
  \n\nHealthcare is transitioning now to what's called fee-for-value or value-based
  care and this is through programs like MIPS, MACRO, etc. Essentially, what value-based
  care means is that there are multiple parties now that are joined to try to make
  the patient better, and the success over a finite timeline determines if the whole
  chain gets paid. \n\nSo because of that, even if you have a really great idea, by
  far the most common blocker to that idea actually being used by the market is not
  understanding exactly who's going to be paying for it and how that will fit into
  this system. \n\n### Healthcare is local \n\nThis means that there is not as much
  competition as you would expect or that we see in other industries. Because of this,
  there's not as much pressure as you might expect in another industry and this lack
  of competition, this lack of pressure, means that the priorities set by the administrators
  at these hospitals are different. \n\n### Healthcare deals with people's lives \n\nThe
  impact of your technology or idea is really a situation of life or death. But even
  underneath that, there's a subtext which is that we're also dealing with the data
  that relates to patients lives. We have PHI and we have human genome sequencing
  data as examples. The data is very different and the stakes with the data are high.
  On the black market, credit card data right now goes for about $35. A patient record
  goes for about $260. So the overall value of your PHI records on the dark web is
  much higher. Because the stakes are so high, it means that conservatism is way higher
  than you would ever expect. \n\n> On the black market, credit card data right now
  goes for about $35. A patient record goes for about $260.”\n\n### More data means
  more complexity\n\nThe amount of healthcare data that is stored has exploded in
  recent years and doctors, hospital, CIOs, and even EHR vendors don't really know
  what to do with all that data. Nobody's really found a way yet how to fit it in
  and make it useful and the fact that it just keeps growing makes that challenge
  even more complex. \n\nBut there are also more complex things beyond just the data.
  For example, take a look at the most recent versions of ICD. ICD-9 had roughly 17,000
  codes, ICD-10 increased that by a factor of 10, and then, with the semantic structure
  changes of ICD-11, there are additional combinations or permutations. Now doctors,
  nurses, CEOs, etc. have to manage more than 1 million permutations of options to
  codify a patient.\n\nAll of that means it's just getting harder for [digital health
  to succeed](https://datica.com/dhsf/) every single year.  \n\n## Things you need
  to know to win at the digital health game\n\n* There really isn't a concept of scale.
  One of the hardest points to communicate to brand-new digital health startups is
  that there is no real-time API. You cannot plug into an API and get access to all
  patients or to all installations of Epic. Every single installation or integration
  of your product at a hospital is reinventing the wheel. Every time it's a VPN, point-to-point
  connection it uses 1980s protocols called HL7. Healthcare is one of the least interoperable
  industries in the country and this is why. \n* The buyer is not the user or the
  one who will benefit. And this goes back to the payment structure we talked about
  above. As soon as you can understand where you fit in the payment structure, your
  business has a chance. \n* The technology is really old on purpose. If you’re a
  technologist, it will shock and upset you to know that most hospitals are using
  an EHR that works in IE8 compatibility mode, and uses ActiveX directory or ActiveX
  tooling. Understanding how your new innovation can fit into that existing, old technology
  paradigm is really important. Also, a hospital CIOs priority is to manage their
  four-to-five-hundred Windows VMs sitting in their data center much more than it
  is to buy a singular app and try to fit it into their existing workflows. \n\nIf
  you take the time to really understand the market, you’ll have much better success
  at getting your foot inside your buyer’s door.\n\n## 4 quick tips for success \n\n1.
  Fit into the existing world that is healthcare. Digital health vendors need to have
  enough capitalization to last through pilots and through the period of trying to
  sell into hospitals.\n2. Stick with a B2B model. A B2C model is really hard to make
  work in healthcare. And that's because people generally aren’t willing to pay for
  apps. The exception to this is the wearable market which is seeing some success.
  To make an impact, you need to think of your market as payers, providers, pharma
  or life sciences — not patients.\n3. Develop clinical evidence and demonstrate outcomes.
  Demonstrate the efficacy of your digital health product to break through the noise
  that your buyer — a CIO, CMIO, CISO, CTO, or CNO — faces.\n4. Gain trust by being
  knowledgeable. You must have a deep understanding of compliance (things like [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/),
  [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/), SOC2, ISO, GXP, and [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/),
  interoperability, [infrastructure](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/),
  frameworks, etc. in order for your buyer to trust you enough to do business with
  you.\n\nFollow this guidance and you’ll be able to walk into your buyer’s office
  on day one with confidence that you have a strategy to be one of the ones who succeed.\n"

    This coming Sunday, March 11, we are holding a day-long boot camp for digital health enthusiasts and entrepreneurs at South by Southwest (SXSW).

    Microsoft is co-hosting with us. We are very excited for the opportunity to share insight on what makes digital health succeed with our friends at Microsoft who have an excellent set of speakers lined up with us.
  :post: |+
    ## Datica presentations at SXSW

    [I kick off the day with a comprehensive overview](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP80977) of the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica.com/dhsf/). As compared to previous talks I've given on the DHSF, this one is a little more expansive on the problems facing digital health ideas, products, and startups. We will dive into topics like payment models, clinical evidence, and other challenges unique to healthcare that I've not previously gone into as deeply.

    Following me is an [in-depth overview of EHRs, interface engines, and data interoperability challenges](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP80976) from [Mark Olschesky](https://datica.com/about/mark/). Those of you who know Mark know there are few in the industry who understand the nuanced challenges of data exchange in clinical settings. The topic will be new to most of the SXSW crowd, which is why we isolated it to its own session. It's a topic that trips up most makers of digital health products, and is worthy of deep exploration.

    After Mark and I go, Microsoft will present on three topics.

    ## Microsoft presentations at SXSW

    First, [Julian Morelli will give a talk on the practicality of bots and AI in clinical settings](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP80985). These new application experiences _are_ possible, but whether they are useful or become adopted has so much more to do with the ecosystem surrounding it rather than the algorithms themselves. We're excited for Julian's presentation.

    [Rich diZerega will then take a deeper look at what types of data are available in healthcare](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP80983). Patient or clinical data is critical to the success of most digital health ideas. It's the lifeblood of an innovation. What we know is that there is _a lot_ of it, but the uniqueness of healthcare means finding access to it is all but impossible. Rich will walk through where and how to find access to data in the industry.

    Lastly, [Ben Summers will finish out the day with a talk on how to leverage existing platforms to deploy your digital health innovations](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP80984). There are many more opportunities to gain access to users, and thus obtain critical user adoption, than most of us realize. Ben's talk is going to be an eye-opener.

    ## We're in this together

    Digital health is really hard. Last October, we [led a panel at Health 2.0](https://datica.com/blog/health-2-0-lunch-and-learn-recap-what-digital-health-success-look-like/) talking about the realities of digital health, flanked by veterans from Cedars-Sinai, Providence Health, and Omada. The session was so powerful, SXSW asked us if we were interested in sharing similar content at this year's festival. We are thrilled with the opportunity.

    Our goal is your success. It is an ethos shared by our colleagues in the health IT trenches at Microsoft. The spirit of this boot camp is to bring practical, actionable advice to the bleeding-edge of digital health thinking.

    If you are attending SXSW, I encourage you to stop by on Sunday, March 11!

  :post: |-
    This new chapter of the Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) will take you through the steps needed to prove your application works — from your first month in business all the way to the twenty-second. Here's what you'll learn, month-by-month in the [Evidence](/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea) section.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea" title="DSHF Evidence: Validating the idea" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 1</a></div>

    ### Validating the idea

    There are a lot of things broken in healthcare and few areas where you can say that care is optimized for patients, let alone providers. The challenge is that there are some strong industry debts, or ingrained impediments, that make some improvements in care unrealistic, especially on aggressive timelines.

    Because of this, the first step in a digital health evidence strategy is to engage with an expert, typically a care provider, champion, or administrator. The outcome of this engagement should be either 1) feedback to adjust the idea and assumptions underlying the digital health product or 2) an expert opinion, ideally in the form of a quote that can be used publicly, in support of the digital health product.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-develop-evidence-roadmap" title="DSHF Evidence: Develop an evidence roadmap" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 3</a></div>

    ### Develop an evidence roadmap

    Not all digital health product categories are created equal when it comes to evidence. The important thing to understand at this stage is how the different kinds of evidence apply to your product. If your product is integrated into care, like a digital therapeutic or a care management platform, then moving towards peer-reviewed evidence in support of the way your product improves outcomes, is necessary. If your product helps to fill empty slots in schedules, you likely won’t ever need to worry about peer-reviewed evidence but you will need to build a body of evidence from real customer data to support your claims of spots filled or recovering of lost revenue.

    It’s at this point that you want to roughly map out your evidence roadmap, which is simply a timeline of when you expect, or hope, to have different levels of evidence. Like a product roadmap, it’s going to be goal-oriented in that you need to back into timelines based on your goal delivery dates for different kinds of evidence.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-create-evidence-collateral" title="DSHF Evidence: Create collateral on evidence for  your product" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 6</a></div>

    ### Create collateral on evidence for  your product

    It would be nice to have a NEJM or JAMA article in support of your product but that’s highly unlikely at this stage of your journey. The goal at this stage is to empower your customer-facing teams with clear and concise collateral containing data about the benefits of your product from real-world applications.

    One additional thing to consider at this stage is customizing evidence collateral for your intended audiences. Maybe you only have one buyer but it’s likely there are other people involved in the buying process, especially if you’re selling to enterprises. Think about ways you can tailor the data, maybe even just the data you highlight, for different audiences.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-applying-healthcare-economics" title="DSHF Evidence: Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 12</a></div>

    ### Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution

    Healthcare economics is focused, at a high level, on the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare — everything from prevention and delivery to collections. [Wikipedia has a good primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics), though you could get a Ph.D. in healthcare economics because it’s that big of a subject.

    The thing that’s hard about healthcare economics is that what seems like a perfectly logical reason to implement a digital health solution, namely because it would result in better care, less expensive overall costs, and clear ROI, doesn’t always make sense.

    You’ll need to understand where and how economic benefits are realized. Many digital health solutions, especially those that target improving outcomes, benefit payors and not health care delivery organizations. This is changing with models that pay for value and not volume, things like readmission penalties and ACOs, but healthcare today largely still operates on volume and not value.

    ### Add credibility and weight to your evidence

    By this time, you should have traction and will be looking to add new customers and implementations for your digital health product. At this stage, you should be thinking about how to expand the collateral you have already created by adding credibility.

    The best way is getting something published on your evidence. This doesn’t have to be in a peer-reviewed clinical journal but could be an online publication. Think of health management publications like Health Affairs. Or, it could simply be joint collateral with one of your customers.

    When we launched the [Digital Health Success Framework](https://datica.com/dhsf) (DHSF) this summer, the immediate reaction from the health IT community, and from digital health teams specifically, was immensely positive. It was like getting a high 5 from a stranger every day.

    Since launch, we learned its greatest strength is also its greatest current weakness. Let me explain.

    The ultimate value of the DHSF is that it is not made up. It's genuine in its attempt to distill thousands of past conversations. The data behind the framework is significant.

    Condensing over 3,000 conversations down to a single piece of digestible content has been a challenge. The first stab at presenting the DHSF went over well, as one of the most positive feedback points has been the linear sequential display of insights.

    Still, for those who don't have the time to consider the complete scope of the written content packaged in the framework, getting started wrapping their head around it—and what it means for them—is daunting.

    This is why we are holding our first [webinar](http://content.datica.com/digital-health-success-framework-overview-webinar-sept-25th-2017) in an attempt to explain the DHSF even more simply than we can via a web experience.

    In our upcoming webinar, scheduled for Monday, September 25th, at 12pm CST, Mark Olschesky, Datica Chief Data Officer, will conduct a lunch-time session that summarizes the origins, key insights, and benefits of the Digital Health Success Framework.

    [Register for the event here](http://content.datica.com/digital-health-success-framework-overview-webinar-sept-25th-2017). We look forward to sharing the DHSF with you on September 25th!
