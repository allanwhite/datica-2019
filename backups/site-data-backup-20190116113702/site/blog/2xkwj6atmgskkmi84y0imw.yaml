:summary: HIPAA is not perfect, nor a golden standard, so changes will need to be
  made to avoid inefficiencies.
:blog_lead: 'Recently, [Brian Murphy](http://www.chilmarkresearch.com/about/team/),
  analyst for [Chilmark Research](http://www.chilmarkresearch.com/), released a post
  titled “[HIPAA Must Die](http://www.chilmarkresearch.com/2015/06/18/hipaa-must-die/)”
  pertaining to the complex nexus of federal and state HIPAA healthcare regulations
  for patient privacy and security.

'
:post: "Murphy states “the time has come for healthcare providers and other stakeholders
  to call for a harmonized regulatory regime for a tangle of issues in healthcare.”
  I am a major fan of the work Chilmark publishes, but had questions arise soon after
  a review of Murphy’s statements.\r\n\r\n### Are the differences between federal
  and state HIPAA regulations affecting the quality of patient privacy and security?\r\n\r\nInitially,
  we at Catalyze are inclined to concur with Murphy that different federal and state
  laws only blur the already skewed lines of HIPAA even further, resulting a diminished
  level of privacy and security applied to PHI. After extended thought, however, I
  asked myself:\r\n\r\n_How would the quality care of PHI be adversely affected if
  privacy and security precedence is set by whichever is more stringent — state or
  HIPAA?_\r\n\r\nFor example, HIPAA grants access to records for patients with the
  exception of psychotherapy notes, but in Vermont patients can access their psychotherapy
  notes under state law. Since Vermont law provides greater rights from the patient’s
  standpoint, state law takes the forefront to federal HIPAA regulations. I do not
  see where a diminished quality of patient privacy and security is taking place.
  \r\n\r\nThere are many other examples that show the difference between federal and
  state HIPAA laws. Why is there a need for an administrative standard of regulations
  especially when HIPAA does not impair states to enact laws that serve to enhance
  patient privacy and when clinicians are assumed to know the workings of federal
  and state HIPAA provisions? As the old saying goes, if it’s not broken, don’t fix
  it.\r\n\r\nWe do agree with Murphy in that there are complexities that arise with
  various interpretations of HIPAA. For example, on September 1, 2012, Texas enacted
  the [Texas Medical Records Privacy Act](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.181.htm)
  which mandates healthcare providers (including mental health) provide additional
  auspices to consumers. This Act applies a more extensive scope than HIPAA as it
  appertains to not only healthcare providers, health plans, and other insurance claim
  related entities, but also any individual, organization, or business that obtains,
  stores, or has control of PHI as well as their emissaries and staff members if they
  produce, acquire, or transmit PHI. Under this Act, individuals, businesses, and
  entities must adhere to several extensive requirements that could produce an administrator's
  most inimical nightmare. Because of such harsh regulations in place, most businesses
  will avoid Texas resulting in a lack of immediate healthcare innovation for the
  state among other ramifications.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, an industry-backed approach
  like HITRUST could be seen as an efficient alternative as it is modeled after PCI
  and is written by a private sector and non-government entities.\r\n\r\nBetween Vermont
  and Texas on opposite sides of the spectrum, it is shown there is room for argument
  that while creating a single standard could reduce complexity, it could also reduce
  iteration by the states towards better policies related to core patient values—privacy
  and security.\r\n\r\n# What do you think?\r\n\r\nHIPAA is not perfect, nor a golden
  standard, so changes will need to be made to avoid inefficiencies. In my opinion,
  a one-size-fits-all solution that will not allow for customization or flexibility
  has its drawbacks that should be acknowledged and discussed before any sort of implementation
  is enacted. HIPAA is largely [enforced by Covered Entities](https://catalyze.io/blog/whos-really-interpreting-and-enforcing-hipaa-for-startups),
  not HHS or the states, so we already have a complicated framework that will need
  to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nDo you think the American healthcare system would benefit
  from a single administrative standard HIPAA approach? Tweet us at [@catalyzeio](https://twitter.com/catalyzeio)
  and [@chilmarkhit](https://twitter.com/chilmarkhit) to continue the discussion.\r\n\r\n"
