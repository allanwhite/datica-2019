:summary: Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined
  with Open-Source Connectors for the Datica Platform.
:blog_lead: Today we are launching one-click installations of [Mirth Connect](https://www.mirth.com/)
  combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve
  the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is
  a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in
  the best way possible.
:post: "> Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
  from three years of learning. We aim to empower the developer community to solve
  the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
  and secure.\n\nThe launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need more
  flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing at
  scale, and future-proofing for things like [FHIR](/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
  and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.\n\nDatica has been doing healthcare integration
  since October 2014, going through a [few iterations in pricing and packaging](/blog/announcing-self-service-and-free-trials/).
  Regardless of the iteration, our pragmatic, partnership approach remained consistent
  and accomplished a lot. In three years we built a team of experts to deliver on
  integrations and delivered over 150 live integrations into healthcare organizations,
  with many more in process. Historically it was a SaaS-based pricing model where
  customers paid a fixed fee per month per interface, per site or even an annual license
  to purchase site-based delivery. We did integration work in every major vertical:
  vendors, life sciences, healthcare organizations, and payers.\n\nTimes have changed
  since 2014 in the integration world. The cloud has gone from a taboo term in digital
  health to the default place to build 99% of new healthcare applications. FHIR has
  gone from a glimmer in [Grahame Grieve's](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1/) eye into
  an API platform that will soon be made available from most of the big EHRs. A new
  wave of digital health developers believe in openness first, even at hospitals as
  they look to commercialize IP in a digital format. There was no way to predict this
  would happen so fast (at least in healthcare, three years seems fast) but we are
  here now.\n\nOver the last three years, we learned the best way to help our customers
  was to teach them this point: there is no silver bullet to integration **but it
  is a problem you can solve with the right tools**. \n\nThat's why we are releasing
  the ability to deploy Mirth Connect with \"one-click\" into your [Datica environment](/platform/).
  You gain the expertise we've built on running reliable and available integration
  capabilities in one-click, deployed directly into your compliant environment on
  the Datica platform. Mirth, which is an open-source platform itself, is a great
  tool for software developers to use for integration. This is why we've written up
  documentation based on the hundreds of integrations that we've done which can teach
  you quickly how to [get started on using Mirth](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001535023-Mirth-Getting-Started).\n\n##
  Open-Source Mirth Connectors\n\nWe also [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
  for transforming data from HL7 to JSON. This is a major evolution for digital health
  teams. We do not believe in locking customers into proprietary APIs, so we have
  published everything we've learned at the transformation layer, with many more scripts
  to come. It's all in an effort to help you gain more transparency and confidence
  with [EHR integration](/discover/ehr-integrations/).\n\nThese connectors are a series
  of libraries that can be plugged into your Mirth Connect environment which immediately
  enable HL7 feeds for consumption by a restful API. We will be continuing to open-source
  content as we create it, including transformers to other data types like those for
  [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Office 365 Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors).
  The only major limitations behind what we aim to open-source will be transforms
  which are based on vendor-specific connections or data models which we can't expose
  due to legal reasons (e.g. Epic Interconnect XML data models).\n\n## Integration
  Environment Details\n\nTake note: the integration environment is much more than
  just Mirth. Each environment has a bundle of tools important to successful integration:\n\n*
  Highly Available (HA) configuration of Mirth instances. HA operations of Mirth are
  not trivial. We make it easy, instantly.\n* HA configuration of Postgres. A supplemental
  database is important for initial message ingestion, and must support a similar
  HA nature for continuous connection.\n* Load balancers.\n* Network monitoring and
  usage alerts. Understanding the traffic usage is important for audit purposes. Additional
  alerting is important for ongoing management of a connection.\n* VPN Management.
  Remember, you do not integrate with Epic, you integrate with a specific site's version
  of Epic. Therefore you'll need a VPN for every integration you plan to make. Our
  VPN tooling makes it easy, combined with our expertise in how to ensure they stay
  connected 24/7.\n\nThe integration environment is available in both the [Standard
  and Professional plans](/pricing). The environment is not available for free trials
  (yet), but will be soon. Along with this update, we have now made VPN management
  available in the Standard plan as well, so people can get started with EHR integration
  for as low as $1,150/mo.\n\nWe're often asked how much throughput a typical environment
  can handle. The answer is _a lot_. A single environment with no modifications can
  handle as many as fifty site integrations. If customers need to scale throughput,
  they simply scale RAM. If you have any additional questions, [please reach out](/services/#cta).
  We're happy to chat.\n\n## Pricing Updates\n\nOne thing you may notice is that we
  do not bundle the integration environment with professional services under the name
  of \"Managed Integration\" anymore.\n\nOur customers that have greater challenges
  or unique needs can now purchase both separately since services are now optional.\n\nThis
  means digital health teams can get all the integration tooling they need — along
  with HITRUST CSF Certified, HIPAA compliant, secure infrastructure housed under
  one [Business Associate Agreement](/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
  — for as little as $1,150/mo.\n\nThe other exciting news about Datica's pricing
  is that this scales much better for you. It's pricing that is truly aligned with
  your success.\n\n## The Future of Integration Is Open\n\nThis is a shift in how
  we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health companies.
  You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance and security,
  but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. This new option gives
  that to you with a single click.\n\nHealthcare developers can get started on new
  projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning. We aim to empower the
  developer community to solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that
  are open, reliable, compliant, and secure.\n\nFor moments where projects seem too
  difficult, [our integration services team](/services) will be ready to jump in and
  help you with that lift. We see a world in which all of our customers can eventually
  own their own integrations and we want to provide the easiest path for customers
  to be able to manage that themselves. [Reach out](/services/#cta) if you have any
  questions, we'd love to help you out.\n"

  :summary: Our Healthcare Innovators podcast continues with an illuminative interview
    with Aaron Neinstein, MD on tech that tames the deluge of patient generated data.
  :blog_lead: We continue our conversations on the subject of healthcare innovation
    with an illuminative podcast interview with Aaron Neinstein, MD. [UCSF’s Dr. Neinstein](https://aaronneinstein.com/)
    gives us a view into some of the promising technologies emerging to organize,
    digest, and analyze the massive amounts of patient-generated data we are quickly
    becoming inundated with. Neinstein also shares his ideas about what we can expect
    to see in the near future, as clinicians gain access to this data.
  :post: "\nHere are a just few of the many ideas you’ll hear in Datica’s Healthcare
    Innovators Series Podcast, [“Emerging Healthcare Data Challenges from Patient
    Centric Technologies.”](https://datica.com/innovation/aaron-neinstein-md-emerging-healthcare-data-challenges-from-patient-centric-technologies/)\n\n-
    **On openness to patient generated data:** “A big thing is more incentives from
    the payors, so over the last two years, we've seen the introduction of the Medicare
    chronic care management codes which create the payment opportunity for use of
    patient-generated health data. What those codes do is allow you to bill on on
    a monthly ongoing basis for taking care of a patient who has two or more chronic
    diseases. You could theoretically have a nurse or someone else on your staff managing
    the patient remotely and be billing for that time.”\n\n- **On other disease communities
    using diabetes as a model for technology and tech services:** “One place in particular
    where we are seeing similarities to diabetes is with asthma. If you think about
    capturing the action and activity that a patient takes in the normal course of
    the day. That's what we are talking about here; these are chronic diseases, where
    coming in for an office visit three or four times a year allows a narrow snapshot
    of what's happening in somebody's life. The reason we care about patient-generated
    health data is in theory because it gives us the opportunity to see what somebody
    is doing day-to-day, 24/7, 365 in the context of their life, and tweak their treatment
    regimen or change their behavior to improve the management of their chronic disease.”\n\n-
    **On how EHRs fit into the future of patient-generated data:** “I think one of
    the things that people don't think about is how many different categories of patient-generated
    health data there actually are. If you break it down, you are talking about 7
    or 8 categories of things that comprise what we now called PGHD.”\n\nSubscribe

  :summary: There's much a digital health company needs to know about EHR integrations.
    Here are 4 essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers.
  :blog_lead: 'During the past three years, we''ve done [a lot of integration work](https://datica.com/platform/success/).
    We''ve worked on more than 150 integration projects with almost 30 EHR vendors.
    We''ve done this work with big organizations and vendors to small FQHCs and niche
    EHR vendors. As a result of all this integration experience, we now have a pretty
    good grasp on the intricacies of how integration works. We can reasonably estimate
    how long it takes us to do a project and how that varies with different types
    of vendors. '
  :post: "> What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of
    a computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" -- Morpheus,
    The Matrix\n\nHowever, despite our progress, there are still hundreds of systems
    that we have not integrated with. In the ambulatory setting alone, there are more
    than 650 technologies certified for Meaningful Use Stage 2. While working with
    the top 30 already gives us a leg up and covers a majority of the industry, it's
    not uncommon for us to hear about a new piece of HIT technology that our customers
    and prospects are looking to integrate with. \n\nDespite your perceptions of us
    as an integration services team, we don't have any secret super powers to solve
    problems with interoperability. Our solution, as simple as it may sound, is just
    being the best at our specialized skill set as we can be. This means:\n\n- Writing
    interfaces and transforming data to programmer-friendly formats using Mirth, an
    open-source interface engine. \n- Setting up VPNs when needed on open-source Strongswan
    appliances.\n- Having a team of experts in health data and project management
    on hand to analyze project needs. \n- Everything hosted on the HITRUST-certified
    Datica Platform, staffed by a team of ops, security, and compliance experts. \n\nWhile
    we may know about obscure technologies that power integrations at a given EHR
    vendor, our process is likely similar to anyone else's when kicking off a project.
    As such, it's worth noting that **some projects may be impossible to complete**
    due to external constraints. Turns out that data blocking in healthcare is really
    a thing. So, if Datica is not helping you in your pre-sales process with customers,
    it's up to you to ask all the necessary questions to ensure that you will be able
    to successfully integrate your application with the EHR and site in question.
    \n\n## Four essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers\n\n###
    1) Can your EHR support my digital health product's scope?\n\n<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"
    alt=\"XKCD comic on complexity\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\">\n\nThe most
    common data integration formats we use to exchange health data are [HL7v2](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)
    and CDA-formatted documents like CCDs and CCDAs. Even though these data formats
    are standards, this doesn't mean all EHRs support exchanging data through these
    formats. In fact, some EHRs have no integration capabilities at all. Make sure
    the EHR supports the data standards that you need. Particularly, make sure the
    EHR supports the data standards in the method you need them. For example, if you
    need CCDs *pushed* to you at the end of a visit vs. *pulling* them proactively,
    you will want to ensure the EHR has the capability to manage that process. There
    is a very real possibility here that the EHR may have no suitable integration
    technology, which may limit your data integration possibilities to flat-file style
    extracts or may require manual data entry to power your application.\n\nIt's worth
    noting that there are some integrations [that seem simple but are really complex](https://xkcd.com/1425/).
    For example, while it would seem obvious that any EHR could expose provider availability
    to schedule appointments, this is actually rare functionality. It's *easy* to
    know what appointments are scheduled/canceled but it's *hard* to know when you
    can schedule an appointment. Just because there are no appointments from 12:00-2:00
    doesn't mean the provider isn't doing hospital rounds or research. As such, what
    may have been an easy API query on Allscripts, Epic, and Athena turns into a nightmare
    of stored procedure R&D and database access requirements with smaller EHRs. This
    is why it's good to have experts on hand to help you understand the rules of the
    road and to match integration expectations to reality. \n\n\n### 2) Do you have
    the internal or external resources to perform the integration work?\n\nSmaller
    organizations may have an EHR with HL7, CDA, or API integration capabilities,
    however, they might not have the personnel to configure their instance to do that
    integration. It's not uncommon to find a nurse or clinic administrator who is
    also the EHR administrator. While they may be able to manage their provider's
    schedules or handle some claims, setting up an interface or API may be foreign
    to them. This can be a blocker for a project. \n\nDatica cannot directly assist
    with a backend EHR build. This is usually for one of these reasons:\n\n- The EHR
    vendor would require us to sign an agreement that had some kind of non-compete
    clause to it. \n- The EHR vendor will not grant us access to their systems. \n-
    We simply lack the expertise in 650 EHRs. \n\nAs such, if the organization needs
    assistance with an internal EHR build, it's out of the scope of our standard integration
    services. While we may be able to refer the organization to other consultants
    or vendors who can assist with this EHR build, additional scope and cost considerations
    would be included.\n\n### 3) Can you commit to getting work done within reasonable
    timelines?\n\nThe top KPI for a fast, successful installation is an agreed upon
    project plan with assigned task owners and due dates. At larger orgs, the only
    task owners are typically the EHR integrators (Datica) and organizational IT.
    However, in some integrations, there may be dependencies on vendors to perform
    some pieces of setup. This is particularly true if the org is not licensed for
    a given interface yet or if the EHR vendor hosts the organization's EHR instance.
    \n\nNot to sell you a horror story but, sometimes, these timelines can be brutal.
    While many projects go live within a month of kickoff, we've also seen projects
    span a year due to EHR vendors dragging their feet on either contracting or infrastructure
    deployments. Other than badgering effectively, unless your customer's organization
    can push their EHR vendor to move faster, it's hard to make the process any faster
    than it is. If your integrated product must be live by a certain point to reach
    contractual obligations to your customer, make sure your customer has the means
    to get that system live by that point. \n\n### 4) Who will validate clinical content
    and logic facilitated through integrations?\n\nYour application may want to segment
    patients based on certain clinical attributes sent in the payload of the HL7 or
    CDA message. For example, you may want your application to send an alert when
    a patient with diabetes is admitted to the hospital. The question, of course,
    is how do you define patients with diabetes? Will they be manually defined by
    clinicians or will you be trying to define them by diagnoses from the admission,
    in their problem list, or by other clinical attributes like High A1C or being
    prescribed insulin?\n\nWhile we can apply some logic to segment patients in our
    interface engine, we do not have clinical informaticists on hand to dictate or
    validate logic that we would create at your behest. The integration engine may
    not be the best place to have that application logic and you may consider those
    mappings and analysis to be IP of your company. You may decide that an organization
    purchasing your digital health product can validate your clinical content (Epic
    did this) or we are happy to refer you to informatics consultants who are qualified
    to assist you.\n\n## Evaluate the Integration's TCO\n\nWith these additional parameters,
    you may want to re-evaluate the [cost to integrate](https://datica.com/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-integrations/)
    your digital health product. If you need to hire a niche EHR consultant to build
    an interface on the EHR itself and it costs $5k, can you pass that along to your
    customer or extract that value within your product? If not, you may debate the
    merits of deploying your product in a standalone fashion or adjusting the terms
    of your deal for your customer. If you're new to this, we can help. All [Datica
    Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) customers can engage with Datica for pre-sales
    support to define implementation strategies and to determine feasibility and ease
    of integration at a given site. \n"

  :blog_lead: 'Almost three years ago, I wrote a blog post about why [there was no
    up front pricing](https://datica.com/blog/why-there-is-no-up-front-pricing/) for
    the Datica Platform or our integration services. It was as earnest as I could
    get about how I felt about our sales model at the time: there was no shortage
    of people who came to our website not understanding why handling some aspects
    of HIPAA compliance or data integration wasn''t as cheap as a $5 Digital Ocean
    droplet.'
  :post: "![Old office](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2eMSsIeNu8YcUuOW6qkEYS/6980a750bcb5cf100747466b6cb69a7e/Datica_old_office.001.png?fm=jpg)\n*That's
    me in 2015, in the background of a photo in Datica's original office.* \n \n*Editor's
    note: As we roll out updates and changes to our new Kubernetes-based compliance
    platform our pricing is fluxuating and we're temporarily back to providing custom
    quotes based on specific configurations. Learn more about our [public product
    roadmap](https://datica.com/blog/what-were-building-daticas-public-product-roadmap/)
    and the exciting things happening at Datica* \n\nWe've done a lot of work since
    then, and we've now changed our opinion on the topic. We now offer up front Datica
    pricing right on the website: [https://datica.com/pricing/](https://datica.com/pricing/).
    I'd like to go through my old article and discussed what changed and why we now
    offer upfront pricing.\n\n1) \"First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead
    to buyer confusion.\" & 2) \"Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges
    comparisons with companies who weren’t direct competitors.\"\n \nRealistically,
    our largest competitors in the compliant cloud space aren’t other PaaS vendors
    but rather DIY solutions on one of the major IaaS vendors like Amazon or Azure.
    At the time, it was hard to communicate exactly what the total cost of ownership
    for build vs. buy would be, since we didn’t fully understand our costs as we were
    building infra at scale and going through our initial sets of audits. We've since
    written massive amounts of documentation on the subject: our [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    and [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) guides provide in depth details
    on effort and costs while our [open-sourced policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies)
    provide a detailed roadmap of what it takes to prove HITRUST certification if
    you were going to DIY.  If you work in a \"We build everything 100% here\" shop,
    you'll find the policies useful for your own build-outs. If you are looking to
    partner with a vendor, we now can provide you with the data to demonstrate that
    we provide the best value on the market.\n \n3) Third, we saw that often prospects
    weren’t entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose
    neither.\n \nDatica is the platform on which everything is built. Compliance is
    the top requirement for all digital health applications and it's where developers
    looking to build or move to the cloud need to begin. Something like integration
    is built on top of the platform, in a complementary fashion. We didn't know how
    to communicate this best in 2015 and we probably didn't help ourselves with mountain
    climbing analogies later that year with Redpoint and Stratum. We've figured out
    better ways to communicate that we want to be your one stop shop for all your
    tough challenges in building digital health products in the cloud — above hosting
    and interface engines.\n \n4) Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of
    the Lean Startup movement: We want to talk to people.\n \nDon't worry! We're still
    out talking to people. We just don't need to bake it into all pieces of the sales
    process if you aren't interested anymore. In fact, we used a lot of feedback and
    discussions from customers and prospects to build the [Digital Health Success
    Framework](https://datica.com/dhsf/).\n \nWhile we made it easier to see our pricing
    and features, we still want to talk. It might be our midwestern roots, but we
    want to learn more about what you're working on and the challenges you're going
    through on your projects. We want to help, even if it means we send you along
    to someone else. Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://datica.com/contact/)!\n\n"

  :summary: Datica has announced the launch of The Platform 3.0 — Compliant Cloud
    reimagined including a HIPAA compliant & HITRUST CSF certified free trial.
  :blog_lead: "Successful products are predicated on the concept of balance. Being
    able to balance what to do, what not to do, and how to do it. It's all a delicate
    balance that at any time can tip the wrong way. And, when the scales tip, companies
    end up delivering sub-par experiences.\n \nAt Datica we've spent a considerable
    amount of time focusing on that balance — when to release new features, where
    to go in the market, who to talk to — it's part of what makes a startup a startup.
    Being able to move quickly, fail fast, and ultimately land in a place that just
    works."
  :post: "> For me, playwriting is and has always been like making a chair. Your concerns
    are balance, form, timing, lights, space, music. If you don't have these essentials,
    you might as well be writing a theoretical essay, not a play.\" - Sam Shepard\n
    \ \nIn March, when I was first promoted to run product, we had our hands in a
    number of different market verticals, feature ideas, and half-baked tools. We
    had spent the better part of two years figuring out where as an organization we
    needed to go. It was our ability to balance all of these activities while still
    supporting a functioning product that has brought us to the point we are today.\n
    \nThe Sam Shepard quote at the top of this article talks about essentials; the
    necessary building blocks of a product that make it stick. At Datica, we're dedicated
    to making our product stick. As such, we've developed a renewed focus on our core
    platform. Over the past four months our engineering team has been building features
    that we all believe are principal to our customers’ success. The overarching theme
    is one of self-service, giving customers the ability to do more on your own.\n
    \nIt is with this renewed focus in mind that I'm incredibly excited to announce
    the launch of [The Platform 3.0—Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    reimagined from the ground up.\n \nIf you've been following Datica for the past
    year or so you would have seen our product go through a number of different changes,
    even if you were just following along on the website. [We have evolved](https://datica.com/catalyze/)
    through multiple product name changes — PaaS, Stratum, and Compliant Cloud. Confusing
    as it may have been, we had very clear strategic goals in mind with each of those
    name evolutions that were valuable learning experiences. This evolution has brought
    us to where we are today, with a renewed focus on the core value of the platform.
    Hence \"The Platform\". We're making it easier this time.\n \n## Empowering new
    customers with self-service\n\nA large part of our core mission at Datica is to
    break down the barriers to compliance so that developing healthcare software is
    the same as developing consumer software. In short, we strive to make [compliance](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)
    a non-issue. This is by no means a small feat and it's not something we can tackle
    completely on our own. We need to empower you, our customers, in ways that allow
    you to help yourselves. We'll build the tools, our customers conquer the mountains.\n
    \nHow does this manifest?\n \n### Self-service onboarding\n\nFirst up is the ability
    to onboard through a [self-service portal](https://datica.com/pricing/). This
    means that as a new customer you can now sign up for a Datica account, enter your
    billing details, spec out an application environment, and deploy that application
    in a matter of minutes.\n \n### 14-day free trials\n\nIn addition to self-service
    onboarding, Datica now provides unfettered [14-day free trials](https://datica.com/pricing/)
    for new customers. This is unlike anything that has been done before in this industry.
    No product in the market has been able to provide a fully-compliant HIPAA & HITRUST
    CSF certified platform trial with no upfront cost.\n \n### Self-service code scaling\n\nBeyond
    14-day free trials, we're now giving customers the ability to scale code services
    entirely on your own. Instead of submitting a support ticket when you need an
    extra gigabyte of ram, simply navigate to that service in the dashboard and scale
    up and down as you wish. This functionality is available for all customer-defined
    services on the platform. \n \nIn addition to self-service scaling, Datica now
    provides customers with the ability to manage billing and contracting details
    in the dashboard.\n \n### Preconfigured Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificates\n\nLast,
    but not least, is our new [Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/)
    feature. One of the largest onboarding pain points for new customers is the ability
    to install, manage, and update SSL certificates on the platform. Now, with Let's
    Encrypt support, all new environments will come preconfigured with a Let's Encrypt
    SSL certificate. Additionally, existing customers can change over to Let's Encrypt
    using the new CLI commands shipping with the Platform 3.0 release.\n \n## Pushing
    forward\n\nWe've spent our time wandering the desert and we've come back with
    a renewed focus on the platform. We're ready now more than ever to make it the
    premier method of deploying healthcare applications to the cloud. Our unrelenting
    drive to make our customers successful is how we get there.\n \nOver the next
    several quarters we'll make drastic improvements to our logging system and the
    CLI console. We’ll also release new features that make it easier and less expensive
    to connect to EHRs than ever before.\n \n*Existing customers will require an amendment
    to their contracts. For more information on getting your contract updated please
    reach out to the upgrade team at upgrade@datica.com.*\n"

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
