:summary: A couple weeks ago at HIMSS, we hosted a CHIME focus group with about 20
  CIOs representing a broad swath of the provider market. The purpose of the conversation
  was to gauge readiness, strategies, and maturity of the cloud in healthcare.
:blog_lead: A couple weeks ago at HIMSS, we hosted a [CHIME](https://chimecentral.org)
  focus group with about twenty CIOs. The group CIOs represented public and private
  healthcare organizations, children’s and specialty hospitals, academic centers,
  and large integrated networks from across the country. It’s safe to say it was a
  broad swath of the provider market. The purpose of the conversation was not to try
  to sell Datica. Our goal was to have a discussion to gauge readiness, strategies,
  and maturity of the [cloud in healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/healthcare-cloud/),
  specifically the public cloud (AWS, Azure, and Google).
:post: |-
  Despite the diversity of organizations represented, the feedback and discussion with the focus group CIOs demonstrated consistency of high-level thinking about the cloud for healthcare delivery organizations. We’re sharing our findings from the session because we fundamentally believe transparency in healthcare technology and healthcare on the cloud benefits the entire industry, including Datica. Below are the topics we covered and the salient points we took away.

  ## What is the cloud?

  This garnered a lot of interesting responses like “a new way to spend money” and “x as a service”. It’s definitely something CIOs are looking at and, in some use cases, using; but, the universal sentiment was that the cloud isn’t going to solve immediate problems facing CIOs. Another interesting insight was that the cloud was seen as a new way to spend money. In the near-to-medium term, as healthcare organizations work directly with cloud service providers or through partners and business associates that are using the cloud, healthcare organizations are going to be managing both on-premise technology as well as spending on cloud. One quote I wrote down was “you can’t justify the move to the cloud for ROI alone”. One CIO mentioned vendors misrepresent the cloud when they pitch it as a cost savings to CIOs with his comment, “cloud providers have to make a margin”.

  ## What are the major roadblocks to the cloud?

  The major roadblocks to the cloud elucidated were competing priorities, security (more on that later), and human capital. Given the consensus of the cloud having a questionable ROI, or a long-term ROI at best, it makes sense that it’s not high on the priority list for CIOs when the majority of their resources are still dedicated to the care and feeding of EHRs. Additionally, we’ve discovered in other conversations that the human capital CIOs do have aren’t cloud, devops, or dev sec ops experts. One other point of feedback was a loss of control associated with a lack of support when moving to the cloud.

  ## How are you using the cloud today?

  With the exception of a couple CIOs mainly representing ancillary service providers, the major use of cloud today were things I’d classify as pet projects, or non-core IT projects. The cloud was being used in innovation, research, and by partners/vendors/business associates. The great cloud migration, or the lift and shift story, is definitely not happening at scale any time soon.

  ## How are you solving security and compliance on the cloud?

  There was not a consensus on how healthcare enterprises are solving the challenges of security and compliance on the cloud. Every CIO acknowledged the importance of security but it is definitely something organizations seem to still be figuring out. There were challenges around cloud security that most of the CIOs acknowledged were not solved problems.

  ## How are you validating 3rd party security on the cloud?

  This was an interesting one. I’ve always speculated that there is no way for healthcare organizations to effectively assess the security of their vendors when it comes to the cloud. Healthcare security and compliance groups don’t have the resources and cannot dedicate the time to verify everything from vendor policies and procedures to technical configurations. In the world of cloud, this challenge is compounded by the number and dynamic nature of available cloud services. Because of this, I’ve thought [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) would succeed as a proxy for bespoke security reviews. To some extent it has and most CIOs at our focus group were considering or already going down the path of HITRUST. But, the universal sentiment we got was that health systems felt they had to be able to do their own security reviews of 3rd parties. They viewed the risk as only partially tied to financial risk of data breach. The major concern we heard was reputation damage to the org and potential scale of a breach on the cloud.

  ## Is Shadow IT a concern at your organization?

  Based on feedback we’d gotten during many of our [Healthcare Innovators](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) podcasts, we published a report last year on [Shadow IT in Healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives/). We know Shadow IT is an important topic for healthcare provider organizations but we wanted to have an open-ended dialog to assess it’s visibility at the CIO level. Almost every CIO in the room expressed concern about Shadow IT at their organization. It seemed like a problem many CIOs had thought about. Some of the major culprits cited werre medical residents. There wasn’t consensus, but one area that emerged is the need for a bimodal IT offering — one for traditional, or core IT, and one for Shadow IT.  One interesting sidebar of this discussion concerned what to do about Shadow IT. The consensus seemed to be that stopping it isn’t an option given increasing knowledge of the Shadow IT community and the lower cost and complexity of cloud development.  It was suggested that a credentialing process be created to establish education requirements, acceptable tools and usage, reporting, etc.  This idea would require a lot of development to be viable, but it has interesting implications.

  We gained a lot of value from the discussion and we hope the CIOs who participated felt it was a good use of their time.

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    <figure>
    <script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/08ebxufc4q.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_08ebxufc4q seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>
    <figcaption>Datica Shared Responsibility Model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

  :blog_lead: |-
    HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

    AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
  :post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
    healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time
    again.\n\nInnovative health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying
    to adopt AWS:\n\n1. **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push
    projects to internally owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving
    to the cloud, those initiatives can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the
    DevOps and cloud engineering resources needed outside of their control.\n\n2.
    **Internal Compliance does not approve of the low levels of liability taken on
    by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
    roughly 1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical
    level and firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's
    responsibility. Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned
    with Internal Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector.
    While AWS themselves have some of the best infrastructure security measures in
    the world, the operating system level is still the responsibility now of the organization
    to secure. That's a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem
    requiring hard-to-find resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll
    combined, most healthcare enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas,
    Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur,
    articulated this exact pain while giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe
    width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n##
    Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST
    has been a godsend.\n\nFor three years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified
    on top of AWS. Our Platform absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the
    cloud, which extends AWS's excellent coverage for compliance **of** the cloud.
    \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
    enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
    internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
    projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
    the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
    \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
    Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and
    compliance in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe
    result is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are
    making a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n##
    Live presentation for those who can't make it at HIMSS\n\nIf you are not attending
    HIMSS this year, or if you are unable to make the 11:00 am time slot on Tuesday,
    March 6th, we are holding a 30-minute webinar later in March to expand on Travis'
    presentation. Please join us if you can't visit us in person at HIMSS.\n\n[Visit
    our webinar overview to register for the March 21st presentation at 12:00 pm CST.](https://content.datica.com/hitrust-on-aws-2018-03-21)\n\nWhile
    you’re at HIMSS make sure to also visit the Datica booth, #5077. See you at HIMSS!\n\n\n"

    is happening now and is grounded in innovation. Its sources might surprise you.
    \ \n\nIn addition to surveying news, stories, and industry reports, the quarterly
    report provides our takeaways on the recent HiMSS conference which we’ve extracted
    below. Make sure to get the [Spring Innovation Report](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
    for a complete look at the state of Innovation in Healthcare. "
  :post: "<img alt=\"himss-2018-logo\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/BejYKjLiuWuE0iEK6WQIM/521488e52b97804bab49f7dd0a1994e2/himss-2018-logo.png?w=240\"
    width=\"120\" class=\"float-left-on-medium\" />\n\nHIMSS 2018 saw the presence
    of three of the largest tech companies in the world flex their muscles. The event
    itself is evidence that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.\n\n##
    The 3 largest tech companies flex their muscles at HIMSS\n\n### Microsoft showcased
    Azure at HIMSS\n\nDue to their rich health IT history, Microsoft has engaged with
    HIMSS in the past, but the company’s positioning in 2018 is noteworthy. A through
    line across its booth facilities, its engagements, and in 1:1 conversations was
    a focus on modernizing health IT via intelligent solutions. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) certainly had a presence, but it was grounded in usable tools like Office
    365 and Microsoft Teams. Any cloud reference had less to do with Azure itself
    and more to do with Microsoft solutions on the cloud. \n\n### AWS went big HIMSS\n\nFor
    the first time in its history, AWS went big with an impressive HIMSS booth. This
    major physical presence is the only major one in healthcare outside of their own
    re:Invent conference. AWS had a mix of solution architecture Q&A, presentations
    from its broad partner ecosystem, and demonstrations of healthcare-specific cloud
    solutions available on AWS. Its 2018 presence showed AWS cares about being active
    in health IT and [AWS has a strong story to tell](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-on-aws-is-possible-find-out-how-at-himss18/)
    with both new digital health companies and enterprise health IT. \n\n### Google
    went all out at HIMSS\n\nBut then we have Google. It also spent big — much bigger
    than Microsoft or AWS. Google had a major booth, but also several keynotes and
    high profile sessions that all must have cost enormous amounts in sponsorships.
    Of the three, it’s easy to see through total spend and coverage that Google is
    making the biggest bet that its cloud offerings can help healthcare. The only
    problem is understanding the actionable theme Google had in mind. Is it looking
    to help hospitals migrate old systems to Google’s cloud? Is it trying to get AI
    adopted in enterprises? The most consistent message centered on helping smaller
    startups succeed, which is then curious why Google would spend so much money getting
    in front of hospital CIOs. \n\nThe aggregate observation is big tech is looking
    to spend big dollars to land a big presence with this big event. All are here
    to stay this time. \n\n## Healthcare innovation was everywhere at HIMSS18\n\n###
    Certain innovations are now mature \n\nFrom the presence of the booths, the coverage
    within sessions, and the chatter amongst attendees, two major areas of innovation
    have finally made it: telehealth and population health. \nThose who follow healthcare
    know these two areas aren’t new, per se. But that’s not the point. The key observation
    from HIMSS18 is that, in the aggregate, all companies have “made it.” Their spend
    was enormous, their booths packed, their messages grand, and their sessions well
    attended. For upwards of a decade, we’ve talked about the eventuality of both
    telehealth and population health. Well, HIMSS18 proved to us that the companies
    that figured out the models have finally crested the mountain in that long journey,
    and are now part of the health IT regulars. \n\n### The startups are mostly focused
    on AI \n\nMost early-stage companies were predominantly downstairs in the startup
    hub, but some were upstairs as well. Regardless of the location, a clear and obvious
    trend prevailed: Artificial Intelligence. AI is coming to healthcare. When it
    arrives, we aren’t certain. Much like telehealth, its timing will likely be tied
    to payment structures and when healthcare systems are allowed to receive reimbursement
    for its use. But the sheer volume of AI-focused business, products, and tools
    staggered attendees and it felt inevitable that AI will disrupt healthcare in
    some capacity. Our guess is that many net-new products will be deployed over the
    next two years, will show demonstrative impact, and then after that a larger watershed,
    will happen similarly to what we saw with telehealth and population health. \n\n###
    Net-new innovation is more popular on the cloud than migrating old systems \n\nLastly,
    we saw the [healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/healthcare-cloud/) as
    a mixed bag at HIMSS18. Conversation after conversation indicated a resistance
    to migrating old systems to the cloud. Ultimately, CIOs aren’t interested in the
    downside — higher hidden costs than the cloud vendor space indicates, high probability
    of downtime or failure of fragile systems during migration, and general unease
    with understanding risks and liabilities yet on the cloud. \n\nDatica ran a CHIME
    focus group with 18 hospital and health system CIOs. Across the board, their sentiment
    remained the same. Migration of existing systems just isn’t a priority. \nOn the
    flip side, much innovation is happening with new projects. These innovations can
    either be in the form of digital health products CIOs are purchasing, or as internal
    projects led by innovation groups. The cloud is not universally bad in the eyes
    of hospital CIOs. In fact, all 18 voiced the priority of cloud-first innovations
    when evaluating new tools or solutions. \nThis dichotomy became one of the more
    interesting observations from HIMSS18. You might also want to take a look at the
    thorough recap and analysis of that [CHIME focus group here](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).\n\n###
    More internal innovation is happening than many realize \n\nOne interesting thread
    throughout the entire conference hinged on the consistency of internal innovation
    being a focus. More conversations led to CIOs or innovation directors looking
    to internal resources for solving a specific problem at their system as opposed
    to buying a new product. \n\nIt’s not just centered with innovation groups, either.
    We were shocked to hear stories of how some institutions are completely rethinking
    innovation from the ground up, giving smaller teams more democracy in those innovations.
    The head of dermatology might be working on her own sanctioned project to innovate
    on a problem. The chief nursing officer might have the job of marshalling a skunkworks
    team to build a new tool for nurses. And so on. It’s happening across the country.
    \n\nIt’s great to see such innovation products constantly entering the health
    IT space. The level of sophistication in just the last few years has jumped considerably
    and will likely continue it’s rapid improvement through the coming years. \n\n\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
