:summary: By now you've heard of the CloudFlare leak of sensitive data. There's a
  specific part of HIPAA legislation that health care should be concerned about.
:blog_lead: |-
  By now you've likely heard of the [CloudFlare parser bug](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) that caused CloudFlare's CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, [a serious problem](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/834900838837411840), or [a historic event](https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/834905083976552449).

  At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/hipaa/). Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?

  As it turns out there's a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.
:post: "## The Conduit Exception\n\n[We've written in the past](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/the-hipaa-privacy-rule/)
  how the [Omnibus rule for HIPAA](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),
  introduced in 2013, has affected companies doing business in the healthcare industry.
  One important clarification made in the Omnibus rule is additional guidance around
  what does and does not fall under HIPAA and the conduit exception.\n\nThe conduit
  exception was introduced for reasons of practicality. In effect, the exception states
  that no legal agreements are required between covered entities and organizations
  that merely act as \"conduits\" for ePHI.\n\nIn the physical world this makes a
  lot of sense. Without this exception it would be impossible for your doctor to discuss
  health issues over the phone or send medical bills over postal mail.\n\nThings become
  a little blurrier in the electronic world. What exactly is the difference between
  an organization/service acting as a conduit for information and an organization/service
  acting as a business associate?\n\nAccording to the [legal wording](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),\n\n>
  … data transmission organizations that do not require access to protected health
  information on a routine basis would not be treated as business associates. This
  is consistent with our prior interpretation of the definition of \"business associate,\"
  through which we have stated that entities that act as mere conduits for the transport
  of protected health information but do not access the information other than on
  a random or infrequent basis are not business associates.\n\nThis is further clarified
  with:\n\n> The conduit exception is a narrow one and is intended to exclude only
  those entities providing mere courier services, such as the U.S. Postal Service
  or United Parcel Service and their electronic equivalents, such as, internet service
  providers (ISPs) providing mere data transmission services. As we have stated in
  prior guidance, a conduit transports information but does not access it other than
  on a random or infrequent basis as necessary to perform the transportation service
  or as required by other law.\n\nSo the final rule clearly calls out ISPs as falling
  under the conduit exemption and that a \"random or infrequent basis\" is the dividing
  line. This is a logical extension of the physical examples given earlier.\n\n##
  Are CDNs Exempt?\n\nUnfortunately, the final rule does not cover CDN services explicitly.
  Let's consider some of the cases where using a CDN makes sense and map them to the
  guidelines above.\n\nOne typical use for CDNs is to place static content geographically
  closer to end users, for example, static HTML or Javascript libraries. These are
  obviously not ePHI but often fall under HIPAA for various reasons.\n\nFor instance,
  if you have a web application and are dynamically loading Javascript from a CDN,
  and if that CDN were ever compromised, any maliciously-injected code could feasibly
  be used to exfiltrate ePHI out of your application. If you're not cryptographically
  verifying the content downloaded from the CDN you are opening up yourself to attack
  vectors. In this case, the CDN would _definitely_ not be covered by the conduit
  exemption; after all, it is storing executable code on your behalf.\n\nAnother use
  involves using the CDN to proxy an application server, essentially acting as a global
  caching layer. Some CDNs claim that because they offer encryption support (HTTPS),
  and they are simply acting as a path for cached information, they are exempt under
  the conduit exception. Unfortunately this argument is invalid and falls apart under
  scrutiny.\n\nSome CDNs require you to upload a copy of your HTTPS certificate and
  private key in order to get HTTPS support. In this case, if that certificate is
  also used to protect ePHI, this is _definitely_ not covered by the conduit exception.
  You are providing keying material that can be used to decrypt sensitive information.
  Not only would this fall under HIPAA legislation, this is bad security hygiene.\n\nEven
  if the CDN uses a separate HTTPS certificate and private key, if it is acting as
  a proxy in front of a health-related application the CDN's servers will likely receive,
  decrypt, and transmit ePHI. In contrast with an ISP the CDN will have access to
  ePHI on much more than a \"random or infrequent\" basis.\n\nAdditionally, simple
  metadata related to some websites may be sensitive. How would you feel if leaked
  HTTP request logs showed a username that corresponds with your Twitter handle visiting
  an intensely personal website such as [a disease-focused dating site](https://www.mpwh.com/)?
  Depending on what information is tracked in the request URLs, even web server access
  logs may inadvertently contain ePHI.\n\nOne can picture data centers full of HTTPS
  frontends silently processing data that may contain sensitive information. Given
  that the CDN staff has administrative access to those machines, how can you be sure
  any ePHI that happens to traverse through their network is being properly protected?
  What legal actions do you have in case it is not being handled correctly?\n\n##
  The Importance of the BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n\nThese issues were some
  of the key motivators for introducing the concept of the [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements),
  or BAA. In HIPAA, these legal agreements are used for a few important reasons:\n\n1.
  To clearly define expectations around how both parties follow HIPAA regulations,
  particularly around how data containing ePHI will be managed.\n2. To delineate the
  risks and responsibilities between both parties, particularly around breach notifications
  and penalties.\n\nWithout such a legal agreement in place allowing a third party
  to access data containing ePHI is a risky proposition. How will you know if data
  is being properly protected? If a security incident happens related to ePHI for
  your customers, how you will be notified so you can take appropriate actions?\n\nIf
  there is no agreement in place there is not a clear legal course of action to take
  in the event of a breach. In fact, given the way HIPAA regulations are enforced,
  without a BAA **you will be liable for any mistakes made by that third party.**\n\nThe
  fiscal repercussions of being on the hook for a breach caused by a third party is
  compelling enough for organizations to ensure that any services they use are covered
  under a BAA. But more importantly, the legal framework of the BAA means that you
  will have done at least a token amount of due diligence in protecting your customer's
  ePHI data. Allowing sensitive data to flow through a third party without such diligence
  is irresponsible and shows a complete lack of respect for your customer's basic
  privacy rights.\n\nOr as Gene Fry [summarized so succinctly](http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/hipaa-conduit-exception-rule/):\n\n>
  Any provider that states they are fully HIPAA compliant will sign a BAA with you,
  and if they don’t, you’re putting your organization and patients’ data at risk.\n\n##
  Impact of the CloudFlare Breach\n\nGiven the scale at which CloudFlare operates,
  the impact of this breach will likely take a long time to fully flesh out. While
  [CloudFlare reacted quickly to respond to this breach](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139)
  it will take some time to regain the trust they lost with this catastrophic mistake.\n\nTo
  the best of our knowledge CloudFlare has never offered a BAA for their customers,
  which means that any organization that used CloudFlare's CDN capabilities with ePHI
  needs to start invoking their breach procedures **now.** We hope all such organizations
  do the right thing and help protect any sensitive data entrusted to them by their
  customers.\n\n*Learn more about how [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud)

    access.

    Healthcare professionals have been tasked with achieving the fine balance between the need to ensure data security and the demand for complete access to information. Though with the incursion of medical and mobile devices – consumer, doctor and hospital – security needs must become top priority. Failure to implement proper access controls in the United States is one of the largest attributors to compromising healthcare organizations’ [patient data](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi) security. The cost of data breaches on providers as a whole is estimated to be at an astounding total of seven billion dollars. With a precarious price point like that, here are a few key points into securing network access:

    ### Network Access Control (NAC) Solutions

    In order to ensure quality patient care, providing absolute, immediate network access has become essential, especially in the face of mandated instant communication. With technological upgrades made daily on operating system versions, the risk for data breaches only rises, so an adaptable security solution becomes pertinent. Using a network access control (NAC) solution will allow the capabilities to identify the type of user and connected device, while simultaneously screening for threats such as obsolete antivirus protection. NAC solutions can permit a network wide view of security status across the breadth of equipment and devices; this view is highly valuable to healthcare organizations, especially those working with multiple vendors that comprise their internal infrastructure.

    ### Securing Network Access for Patrons

    A sundry population exists that accesses a healthcare network – visiting physicians, specialists, patient guests, family, etc. – so it is IT’s responsibility to ensure network security while reducing the administrative obligations that accompanies guest management. To do this, IT must secure the network by having each guest user and device be identifiable and only those that are authorized be able to connect. Taking identification further, network access can be restricted by device, department or time of day. This access must be provisioned though and guest management processes must become part of an automated workflow as to minimize the obligation on IT. For example, patrons should be automatically signed off from network access after a predetermined period of inactivity and concurrent logins must be disabled.

  :summary: The HIPAA Omnibus Rule accounted for the paradigm shift in technology
    development and cloud computing.
  :blog_lead: 'The HIPAA Omnibus Rule that went into effect in 2013 changed the landscape
    of HIPAA. It created a new name for business associate called a "subcontractor".
    In much the same way a business associate processes, transmits, or stores ePHI
    for a [covered entities](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/), a subcontractor
    processes, transmits, or stores ePHI for a business associate.

'
  :post: |+
    It's easier to just consider them a business associate of a business associate. And subcontractors are required to sign business associate agreements (BAAs). We get asked a lot about subcontractors and BAAs by customers and prospects.

    In creating this new category of entities, the Omnibus Rule accounted for the paradigm shift in technology development and cloud computing. The most commonly used example of a subcontractor is a cloud hosting provider, like Catalyze. But there are many other types of services that could be considered subcontractors. As data and services are exposed using web services, typically APIs, there is a huge number of BLANK as a Service offerings that have cropped up. Many modern applications utilize third party APIs for features and functionality. Using simple to consume APIs, modern applications can tap into databases, messaging (SMS or Push or email or Voice), metrics, logging, customer support, data sources, backup, and on and on. When applications use APIs, depending on the service, certain data is passed back and forth to third parties. According to the new Omnibus Rule, if ePHI data is passed to these 3rd party web services, those services are subcontractors and required to sign BAAs. Since things like IP addresses, when combined with information like a providers name, date of service, payment for healthcare service, can be considered ePHI, this gets very murky, very fast.

    What we're starting to see now, and what we should see a lot more of, are chains of BAAs from covered entity to a business associate to any number of subcontractors for that business associate. At the center is the covered entity. Branching out from there into business associates and then subcontractors, sort of like a tree. With this chain of relationships and BAAs, all entities are typically taking on some risk.

    The main questions relate to responsibility and risk exposure. At the end of they day, it's the covered entity, and likely the compliance office at the covered entity, that is going to decide what is acceptable for its business associates, and in turn what is acceptable for the subcontractors of its business associates. In the case of many compliant infrastructure providers, the BAAs they sign assume very little risk and leave much of the technical responsibility, and associated risk of a breach, on the customers that use them; we created Catalyze to provide a more sane approach to compliance, acting as more of a partner and full service compliance platform, with the associate risk that entails, to make it simpler to utilize the cloud in a compliant way.

    hackers and HHS. It's a dedication to doing the right thing for users and their
    PHI every day.
  :blog_lead: 'We have [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](/academy/business-associate-agreements)
    with all vendors that are partners to deliver our services which we pass through
    to our customers through our BAAs. It certainly simplifies things for our customers.

'
  :post: |-
    I was talking with a customer the other day about integrating with a service they used for real-time data processing. I first looked to see if this vendor would sign a BAA. I received this from their support staff:

    - The vendor in question doesn't necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant because they aren't storing data.
    - But, even if they did, they encrypted the data in transit and in storage.
    - Ergo, they are HIPAA-compliant.

    Parts of this are true, and it's good the vendor is encrypting data passing through their systems. However, a lot is left out.

    - There is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](/open-source/policies). At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA's physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#physical-safeguards-see-a-hrefhttpwww-hhs-govocrprivacyhipaaadministrativesecurityrulephyssafeguards-pdf164-310a). As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor to ensure legitimacy.
    - Even though the vendor claimed they were not storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection under HIPAA. Also, I would never take a vendor's word on this. You definitely want that promise in writing, in a BAA.
    - If you are going to work with a vendor who [transmits or stores PHI](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi), they've got to sign a BAA with you. Doesn't matter if they encrypt their data. Doesn't matter if they have printed policies that map to HIPAA rules. Doesn't matter if they are a big company that works with enterprises. Doesn't matter if they buy you dinner. Doesn't matter if they'll write a GUI in Visual Basic to scan for Angelina Jolie and Matthew Broderick. You will be on the hook in the event of an audit or breach and you will lack any avenue to seek legal recourse. That's the worst case scenario. HIPAA's rules and policies are exactly for that event.

    I'm always wary of companies that claim to be HIPAA-compliant that don't have clear BAAs or policies. HIPAA compliance isn't a sticker that you put on servers that wards off hackers and HHS. It's a dedication to doing the right thing for users and their PHI every day. There's no HIPAA police or mandated marketing policies, so there's nothing to stop companies from claiming HIPAA compliance by providing you zero or minimal reasonable safeguards of PHI. The bad news is that the moment you'd find out that you weren't covered under HIPAA, barring it didn't prevent a sale, would be at the worst possible moment of a breach or an audit. We can help you avoid this, and in addition to a BAA, you'll get superb service and ops support too.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
