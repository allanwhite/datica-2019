:summary: Datica has announced the launch of The Platform 3.0 — Compliant Cloud reimagined
  including a HIPAA compliant & HITRUST CSF certified free trial.
:blog_lead: "Successful products are predicated on the concept of balance. Being able
  to balance what to do, what not to do, and how to do it. It's all a delicate balance
  that at any time can tip the wrong way. And, when the scales tip, companies end
  up delivering sub-par experiences.\n \nAt Datica we've spent a considerable amount
  of time focusing on that balance — when to release new features, where to go in
  the market, who to talk to — it's part of what makes a startup a startup. Being
  able to move quickly, fail fast, and ultimately land in a place that just works."
:post: "> For me, playwriting is and has always been like making a chair. Your concerns
  are balance, form, timing, lights, space, music. If you don't have these essentials,
  you might as well be writing a theoretical essay, not a play.\" - Sam Shepard\n
  \ \nIn March, when I was first promoted to run product, we had our hands in a number
  of different market verticals, feature ideas, and half-baked tools. We had spent
  the better part of two years figuring out where as an organization we needed to
  go. It was our ability to balance all of these activities while still supporting
  a functioning product that has brought us to the point we are today.\n \nThe Sam
  Shepard quote at the top of this article talks about essentials; the necessary building
  blocks of a product that make it stick. At Datica, we're dedicated to making our
  product stick. As such, we've developed a renewed focus on our core platform. Over
  the past four months our engineering team has been building features that we all
  believe are principal to our customers’ success. The overarching theme is one of
  self-service, giving customers the ability to do more on your own.\n \nIt is with
  this renewed focus in mind that I'm incredibly excited to announce the launch of
  [The Platform 3.0—Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) reimagined from
  the ground up.\n \nIf you've been following Datica for the past year or so you would
  have seen our product go through a number of different changes, even if you were
  just following along on the website. [We have evolved](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/catalyze/)
  through multiple product name changes — PaaS, Stratum, and Compliant Cloud. Confusing
  as it may have been, we had very clear strategic goals in mind with each of those
  name evolutions that were valuable learning experiences. This evolution has brought
  us to where we are today, with a renewed focus on the core value of the platform.
  Hence \"The Platform\". We're making it easier this time.\n \n## Empowering new
  customers with self-service\n\nA large part of our core mission at Datica is to
  break down the barriers to compliance so that developing healthcare software is
  the same as developing consumer software. In short, we strive to make [compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)
  a non-issue. This is by no means a small feat and it's not something we can tackle
  completely on our own. We need to empower you, our customers, in ways that allow
  you to help yourselves. We'll build the tools, our customers conquer the mountains.\n
  \nHow does this manifest?\n \n### Self-service onboarding\n\nFirst up is the ability
  to onboard through a [self-service portal](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/). This means
  that as a new customer you can now sign up for a Datica account, enter your billing
  details, spec out an application environment, and deploy that application in a matter
  of minutes.\n \n### 14-day free trials\n\nIn addition to self-service onboarding,
  Datica now provides unfettered [14-day free trials](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/)
  for new customers. This is unlike anything that has been done before in this industry.
  No product in the market has been able to provide a fully-compliant HIPAA & HITRUST
  CSF certified platform trial with no upfront cost.\n \n### Self-service code scaling\n\nBeyond
  14-day free trials, we're now giving customers the ability to scale code services
  entirely on your own. Instead of submitting a support ticket when you need an extra
  gigabyte of ram, simply navigate to that service in the dashboard and scale up and
  down as you wish. This functionality is available for all customer-defined services
  on the platform. \n \nIn addition to self-service scaling, Datica now provides customers
  with the ability to manage billing and contracting details in the dashboard.\n \n###
  Preconfigured Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificates\n\nLast, but not least, is our new
  [Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/) feature. One of the largest
  onboarding pain points for new customers is the ability to install, manage, and
  update SSL certificates on the platform. Now, with Let's Encrypt support, all new
  environments will come preconfigured with a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. Additionally,
  existing customers can change over to Let's Encrypt using the new CLI commands shipping
  with the Platform 3.0 release.\n \n## Pushing forward\n\nWe've spent our time wandering
  the desert and we've come back with a renewed focus on the platform. We're ready
  now more than ever to make it the premier method of deploying healthcare applications
  to the cloud. Our unrelenting drive to make our customers successful is how we get
  there.\n \nOver the next several quarters we'll make drastic improvements to our
  logging system and the CLI console. We’ll also release new features that make it
  easier and less expensive to connect to EHRs than ever before.\n \n*Existing customers
  will require an amendment to their contracts. For more information on getting your
  contract updated please reach out to the upgrade team at upgrade@datica.com.*\n"

  :blog_lead: 'Almost three years ago, I wrote a blog post about why [there was no
    up front pricing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/why-there-is-no-up-front-pricing/) for
    the Datica Platform or our integration services. It was as earnest as I could
    get about how I felt about our sales model at the time: there was no shortage
    of people who came to our website not understanding why handling some aspects
    of HIPAA compliance or data integration wasn''t as cheap as a $5 Digital Ocean
    droplet.'
  :post: "![Old office](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2eMSsIeNu8YcUuOW6qkEYS/6980a750bcb5cf100747466b6cb69a7e/Datica_old_office.001.png?fm=jpg)\n*That's
    me in 2015, in the background of a photo in Datica's original office.* \n \n*Editor's
    note: As we roll out updates and changes to our new Kubernetes-based compliance
    platform our pricing is fluxuating and we're temporarily back to providing custom
    quotes based on specific configurations. Learn more about our [public product
    roadmap](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-were-building-daticas-public-product-roadmap/)
    and the exciting things happening at Datica* \n\nWe've done a lot of work since
    then, and we've now changed our opinion on the topic. We now offer up front Datica
    pricing right on the website: [https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/).
    I'd like to go through my old article and discussed what changed and why we now
    offer upfront pricing.\n\n1) \"First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead
    to buyer confusion.\" & 2) \"Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges
    comparisons with companies who weren’t direct competitors.\"\n \nRealistically,
    our largest competitors in the compliant cloud space aren’t other PaaS vendors
    but rather DIY solutions on one of the major IaaS vendors like Amazon or Azure.
    At the time, it was hard to communicate exactly what the total cost of ownership
    for build vs. buy would be, since we didn’t fully understand our costs as we were
    building infra at scale and going through our initial sets of audits. We've since
    written massive amounts of documentation on the subject: our [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    and [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) guides provide in depth details
    on effort and costs while our [open-sourced policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies)
    provide a detailed roadmap of what it takes to prove HITRUST certification if
    you were going to DIY.  If you work in a \"We build everything 100% here\" shop,
    you'll find the policies useful for your own build-outs. If you are looking to
    partner with a vendor, we now can provide you with the data to demonstrate that
    we provide the best value on the market.\n \n3) Third, we saw that often prospects
    weren’t entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose
    neither.\n \nDatica is the platform on which everything is built. Compliance is
    the top requirement for all digital health applications and it's where developers
    looking to build or move to the cloud need to begin. Something like integration
    is built on top of the platform, in a complementary fashion. We didn't know how
    to communicate this best in 2015 and we probably didn't help ourselves with mountain
    climbing analogies later that year with Redpoint and Stratum. We've figured out
    better ways to communicate that we want to be your one stop shop for all your
    tough challenges in building digital health products in the cloud — above hosting
    and interface engines.\n \n4) Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of
    the Lean Startup movement: We want to talk to people.\n \nDon't worry! We're still
    out talking to people. We just don't need to bake it into all pieces of the sales
    process if you aren't interested anymore. In fact, we used a lot of feedback and
    discussions from customers and prospects to build the [Digital Health Success
    Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/).\n \nWhile we made it easier to see our pricing
    and features, we still want to talk. It might be our midwestern roots, but we
    want to learn more about what you're working on and the challenges you're going
    through on your projects. We want to help, even if it means we send you along
    to someone else. Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/)!\n\n"

  :summary: Datica has spent extensive time and money on security and organizational
    policies and procedures specifically to comply with HIPAA and share with our customers.
  :blog_lead: The short answer to that question is, not surprisingly, **it takes A
    LOT of time, energy, and money to be 100% HIPAA compliant**. At Datica, we're
    focused on security and HIPAA compliance. It's a differentiator and we aren't
    reaching when we say *[It's in our DNA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)*,
    referring to HIPAA compliance. Because of that focus, we have a lot of [resources
    for compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/). That translates
    to a lot of time and money on security and organizational policies and procedures
    specifically to comply with HIPAA.
  :post: "\nWe recently completed our 3rd external [HITRUST audit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)
    along with an internal SOC 2 audit. The HITRUST audits were performed by [Coalfire
    Systems](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/), a large national 3rd party
    auditor. The results of that audit and assessment can be boiled down to this badge
    that our customers can post to their own websites.\n\n<a href=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance?utm_source=customerbadge\"><img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"
    src=\"https://datica-2019.netlify.app/public/img/customer-badges/datica-compliance-badge-dark-@2x.png\"
    width=\"220\" alt=\"HIPAA Compliant HITRUST CSF Infrastructure by Datica\"></a>\n\nThe
    truth is it took a lot of time and effort to get here, and we learned way more
    about HIPAA and security than we ever expected. We did not outsource any of our
    compliance work because it is core to what we do. All of our policies and procedures
    are written, reviewed, and maintained in house, just like our code; policies are
    reviewed, using a similar pull request process that we use for our code review,
    as well as by external auditors, but our policies are owned wholly by Datica.
    Below are some high level things we've learned.\n\n## Information security \n\nThis,
    and policies below, are the most obvious parts of HIPAA. Our technology is built
    from the ground up to be secure and expose data only when access is specifically
    granted, never by default. Starting with a minimum access standard is hard when
    you are trying to build a flexible cloud platform for developers but we think
    we've accomplished combining simplicity, security, and flexibility.\n\nAs part
    of Datica’s risk management program, we review the SOC 2 reports of AWS, Azure,
    Rackspace, and all other suppliers of services that involve ePHI. In turn, our
    customers should evaluate us as part of their program by reviewing Datica's compliance
    documents, specifically the HITRUST and SOC 2 reports. These reports confirm our
    risk management program as outlined in the [Risk Management section](https://policy.datica.com/#4.-risk-management-policy)
    of our compliance policy.\n\nThere are countless innovative and powerful things
    we do to maintain the integrity, privacy, and security of data on Datica and we
    make it a point to [open-source](https://github.com/daticahealth) those with our
    customers and the cloud community as a whole.\n\n## Policies \n\nSpeaking of policies,
    we have a lot of policies and I don't think we fully expected to spend so much
    time developing and refining them. The last time I checked we had about 26,000
    words worth of policies, including our BAA. You can look at our [policies here](https://policy.datica.com).\n\nAll
    of our policies are written in Markdown and we use Github for version control.
    Our [policies are open sourced](https://github.com/daticahealth) in hopes that
    others can use them to simplify their lives.\n\n## Procedures for HIPAA compliance\n\nPolicies
    are the easy part compared to procedures. Policies dictate the procedures that
    are required to adhere to those policies. Procedures are the processes that define
    specifically how we operate at Datica. Procedures can make for tedious work, especially
    when it comes to HIPAA compliance where documentation is essential at pretty much
    all everything. We did not anticipate how many procedures we'd need to put into
    place but we've been creative in their application and it's let us remain agile
    within a highly regulated industry.\n\n## Forms and tracking for HIPAA\n\nTightly
    tied to procedures above are the number of forms and the amount of tracking that
    we do. As an example, when you create a policy for [system access](https://policy.datica.com/#system-access-policy),
    you need a way to track requests and access grants to various systems and data.
    This is one of many examples, including changes to our infrastructure, firewall
    rules, etc. We lean heavily on JIRA Issues and tracking for this, and find them
    to be very effective. When we were going through our HIPAA audits and our HITRUST
    audit, this was a very easy way for us to show evidence of following policies
    and procedures.\n\n## HIPAA Training \n\nPart of the HIPAA requirements are that
    all workforce members (employees and contractors) have training on HIPAA. We looked
    at the available training options and felt that the majority were created for
    covered entities, people that handle paper records, and people that work with
    patients. We decided those had zero value to our employees so we wrote our own
    [HIPAA introductory training](https://training.datica.com). All new employees
    at Datica complete this training. We also do regular demonstrations that cover
    topics related to security, privacy, and health industry trends for all Datica
    team members.\n\n## BAAs for new technologies\n\nAt Datica we don't have ready
    access to any ePHI, but we do store sensitive information and support our customers
    with their applications. As such, we made the decision early on to either own
    and manage systems that store sensitive information or work with companies that
    will sign BAAs with us. \n\nWe took all of these steps, dedication all of these
    resources, and spent all of these resources because operating as a business associate,
    with all organization and admin requirements met, sets us apart from everybody
    else in the compliant infrastructure business. We don't just sign business associate
    agreements (BAAs) and secure our infrastructure, we comply with HIPAA to the full
    extent of the rules. It gives us additional insight into our customers' needs
    and keeps us intimately close to the problem we are solving. It is also extremely
    valuable to our customers when they work with compliance offices and point to
    our audit reports and [guides](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).\n\nWhen you decide
    to go down the path of hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant cloud, we
    encourage you to spend time digging deeper than sales and into how the offerings
    and organizations available to you differ in approaches to HIPAA, and which are
    really solving your problem vs selling you a [checkbox for a BAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements).
    If you have a question about about compliance at Datica, please [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com)
    and we'll be happy to tell you everything we've learned and why we're so proactive
    about compliance and transparency.\n"

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
