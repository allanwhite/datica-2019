:summary: We had some amazing inspiration from the 2015 Digital Health Summer Summit
  co-hosted by the Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI).
:blog_lead: |-
  With 2016 rapidly approaching, we are reflecting on what a huge success 2015 was for us but we really can't take all the credit – we had some amazing inspiration from fellow industry leaders. One of the most memorable experiences we partook in and sponsored this year was the [2015 Digital Health Summer Summit][1] co-hosted by the [Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI) at UCSF][2] where my fellow Cofounder and CEO, [Travis Good][3], got the opportunity to moderate a panel on [dealmaking, piloting and scaling][4]. As a relatively young company, we are all ears to the learnings offered by others, and what we took from this event back in June inspired our next six months and beyond.

:post: "As we discussed in our recap of the summit, the importance of partnerships
  seemed to be a recurring theme throughout the conference.  Afterall, we're all working
  towards the same goal: exceptional patient care at a fraction of the cost. In order
  to truly shift to a value-based care model though, transformative partnerships are
  essential, as Director of CDHI, [Michael Blum, MD][5], stated in his Keynote presentation
  (video below). [Dr. Blum][6] is responsible for building partnerships and overseeing
  the strategic direction of CDHI so it was extremely insightful to listen to his
  comprehensive vantage point on UCSF's transformatvie partnerships and how they are
  working to transform healthcare delivery with innovations in digital health.\n\nCDHI
  at UCSF is full of passion and intellect, pioneering a new era of precision medicine
  to improve global health with innnovators from all arenas of digital health. One
  of the innovators they partner with happens to be a partnership we have in common
  – [Voalte][7].  Just last month, we attended and sponsored Voalte's first annual
  user conference, [VUE15][8], where we learned about Voalte's newly publicized [partnership
  with Uber][9]. Yet another perfect example of how these alliances are transforming
  the industry.\n\n### 4 considerations we apply to our own partnerships\n\nAfter
  the Digital Health Summer Summit we became aware and hypercritical to those we work
  with. Here are a few of the citerion we consider:\n\n1. **Strategic alignment with
  care, precision and process **– Linking our structure and resources with strategy
  and technology results in more effective partnerships through cost optimization,
  relationship intimacy and disruptive innovations. \n2. **Understanding our partner
  organizations as well as we know our own **–** **There is clearly added value in
  working with other organizations so a common understanding of culture, values, and
  approach needs to exist.\n3. **Mitigation and minimalization of** **risk** – Jumping
  into a partnerhsip is easy but addressing risks prior is essential as the both entities'
  reputations are on the line. Engaging in low-risk, trial collaborations is one potential
  method for evaluating a potential partner before any serious commitment is made;
  this is why most innovators adopt pilot programs.\n4. **Clarification of roles**
  – Individual members' responsibilities with division of labor and legal agreements
  should be enacted from that first kickoff meeting. Internal discussions around every
  engagement and positioning of new partnerships and opportunites need to be had and
  agreed upon.\n\nWhat are some of the criterion you consider in your organization's
  partnerships? [Tweet us][10] about them!\n\n[5]: https://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-blum-md/18/873/aa0\n[6]:
