:blog_lead: "Healthcare systems are currently presented with the opportunity to contribute
  towards worthwhile innovations. The intersection currently happening between domains
  is disrupting the industry, allowing healthcare enterprises to leverage their influence
  to control costs and quality of patient care. There are cogent forces driving these
  disruptive innovations such as the need for economical, intuitive, and automated
  products and services. One way that healthcare providers can drive this innovation
  is through strategic partnerships with vendors. \n"
:post: "We at Catalyze salute those healthcare systems seeking to better the industry
  and would like to call attention to two transformative partnerships.\n\n### Cleveland
  Clinic & HealthSpot\n\nBack in 2014, [Cleveland Clinic](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/),
  ranked a top five hospital in the nation for 21 consecutive years, partnered with
  [HealthSpot](https://www.healthspot.net/), a health IT firm, to provide telemedicine
  kiosks to increase the scope of patient care. HealthSpot seeks to combine technology
  with physician expertise to offer a transformative patient-provider relationship.
  These kiosks are constructed for walk-in patients with minor conditions to receive
  treatment from their physician remotely. The kiosks are connected to Cleveland Clinic’s
  EMR system and integrates the information from patient’s visits into the patient’s
  record. [Toby Cosgrove](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/205372152-Toby-Cosgrove?trk=mp-details-footer-follow),
  MD, CEO, and President of Cleveland Clinic, said in a new release on the collaboration,
  “Healthcare innovation is essential to make care more accessible to patients. This
  relationship allows patients to utilize the latest technology to connect to Cleveland
  Clinic experts in a more convenient way. This strengthens our ability to meet the
  growing need of patients in everyday settings, delivering higher value for their
  healthcare dollar.”\n\n### Children’s Specialized Hospital & VGo\n\n[Children’s
  Specialized Hospital](http://www.childrens-specialized.org/), the largest pediatric
  rehabilitation health system in the country, and [VGo](http://www.vgocom.com/) partnered
  to implement robot utilization that enables physicians to interact with special
  needs patients 24 hours a day, even when the physician is offsite. Children’s Specialized
  Hospital was the first pediatric rehabilitations hospital to facilitate “telepresence”
  technology.

  DO, CMO of Children’s Specialized Hospital was quoted in a news release saying,
  “Telemedicine is transforming the way we provide healthcare, and we are fortunate
  Children’s Specialized Hospital can offer this innovative tool to improve patient
