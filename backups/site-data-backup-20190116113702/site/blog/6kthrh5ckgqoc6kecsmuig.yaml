:summary: We are moving towards a future where overcommitment to compliance and larger
  investments in security are prerequisites for healthcare innovation.
:blog_lead: 'One interesting tidbit to come out of HIMSS 2015 was an interview with
  Adam Greene, who formally worked out of the Department of Health and Human Services''
  Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Initially covered by [GovInfoSecurity](http://www.govinfosecurity.com/interviews/could-big-hipaa-settlements-be-coming-i-2633),
  Mr. Greene hinted that the **largest HIPAA violation settlements we''ve ever seen
  could emerge later this year**. The interview was recorded, and is worth a listen
  for those interested.

'
:post: |+
  The increasing financial liability of insecure or noncompliant systems is a major concern for healthcare institutions and digital health startups alike. For entrepreneurs, the threat is existential—one slip and the business is likely over. For healthcare institutions, the threat, while not quite as existential, is equally feared.

  We are moving towards a future where overcommitment to compliance and larger investments in security are prerequisites for healthcare innovation. While these items have always been a priority, if Mr. Greene's projection proves true, the calculus on new internal and external projects will change.

  ## Focus on your job, not compliance

  Focus. We all desire it with our jobs. Compliance is a distraction. We haven't been shy to pitch this sentiment [throughout our website](https://datica.com/). While originally it was focused more towards digital health startups, the same can be said to healthcare administrators.

  We understand your job, Ms. CIO and Mr. CTO, is to [innovate](https://datica.com/innovation/). It is to provide better patient care that leads to better patient outcomes. You would prefer to spend your days evaluating new ideas, judging new technology, and implementing smart programs. What you don't want to be doing is worrying about regulation and [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) with each new proposed project.

  We are starting to see the [trust](https://datica.com/compliance/) Datica brings to the infrastructure part of projects as critical to healthcare administrators' ability to focus on the job. If Mr. Greene's hypothesis that we'll soon see unprecedented settlements comes true, the importance of this trust will only increase.

  ## What HIPAA settlements mean for digital health startups

  It's already difficult gaining the attention of hospital administrators. As our [Innovation Series](https://datica.com/innovation/) highlights, CIOs are looking for many signals.

  * Smart ideas to real problems
  * Stable companies with impressive founding teams
  * Financially viable engagements
  * Easy to implement solutions

  Just to name a few. If **HIPAA settlements** hit hard and fast, assurance that external vendors—like your digital health startup—are not a compliance risk will vault to the top of list. Proving you can solve a real problem while not being a security liability will be central to your sales pitch.

'
  :post: "### So what does a HIPAA Risk Assessment require?\n\nThe Department of Health
    and Human Services has defined nine necessary constituents of a HIPAA risk assessment
    that all healthcare and healthcare-related organizations that store or share ePHI
    must include in their assessment document:\n\n1. Assessment Scope - Inclusive
    of any and all potential risks and susceptibilities to the privacy, procurability,
    and morality of ePHI. Organizations should be inclusive of electronic media that
    is utilized such as portable devices, networks, and desktops. If there are multiple
    sites, it is important to include the network security between them in the scope;
    this includes your hosting terms with third-parties or business associates.\n\n2.
    Data Reserve - Where is the data being stored, collected, conserved or transmitted?
    \n\n3. Specify and Record Latent Risks and Susceptibilities - Predicting future
    HIPAA violations can really help your organization rapidly and effectively find
    a resolution.\n\n4. Evaluate Existing Security Measures - This will include any
    encryption, two-factor authentication, and all other security methods that your
    HIPAA hosting provider has put in effect.\n \n5. Evaluate the Feasibility of a
    Risk Occurring - In association with #3, this will accurately estimate the possibility
    of an ePHI breach.\n\n6. Evaluate the Impact a Risk Occurrence Could Have - Assess
    how many people could be affected and the level of PHI that could be exposed,
    inclusive of health information and billing information. \n\n7. Assess the Level
    of Risk - The Department of Human and Health Services recommends taking #5 and
    #6 to establish the level of risk. When documenting these risk levels, accompany
    with them a list of actions that would be performed in a mitigative response.\n\n8.
    Prepare Documentation - There are no parameters around documentation formatting
    but the assessment must be in writing.\n\n9. Regular Reviews and Updates to HIPAA
    Risk Assessment - It is crucial that the assessment is ever ongoing. It is recommended
    that a new assessment is taken whenever new processes, technologies, or operations
    are introduced into an organization. \n\nCurious how we at Datica do our HIPAA
    Risk Assessment? \n\nCheck out our [Datica HIPAA Docs](https://hipaa.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-compliance)

    for the healthcare IT professional. \n"
  :post: |
    ### Business Associates must provide proof of compliance to Covered Entities
    According to the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, covered entities must ensure that their [business associates](/blog/the-importance-of-business-associate-agreements-baas) are instituting proper compliance efforts. This is formerly referred to as “satisfactory assurance” and covered entities must receive this to assure that [protected health information](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi) managed by business associates is meeting the security and privacy protection requirements of the Omnibus Rules, as well as HIPAA and HITECH. So not only must business associates be compliant, but they must provide documentation other sources of information to prove compliance, which has always been the most difficult part of HIPAA.

    ### No penalty caps

    Under the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, certain clarity has been brought to penalties for violations. Although the actual Omnibus Rule seems to be silent on the subject, HITECH seemed to put a cap on the total fines that could be assessed, but the Omnibus Rule does provide new language to revise HITECH’s penalty cap. It is stated in the addendum that there can be civil penalties up to $1.5 million for all identical HIPAA violations in a year. Both covered entities and business associates, can receive further penalties if willful neglect is at play. There can also be additional forfeits if these violations are not identical for up to another $1.5 million per non-identical violation.

    ### Data breaches are assumed with PHI disclosure

    Prior to the HIPAA Omnibus Rules, when covered entities and business associates had sensible supposition that any unseemly disclosed PHI had not been accessed, then that was it, no further investigation or reporting had to be done. Now, under the Omnibus Rule, the disclosure of PHI is automatically assumed to be a [data breach](/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches). “Innocent until proven guilty” no longer applies. The covered entity or business associate will now need to show that there is a very slim chance that the PHI has been undermined. Now organizations must prove their innocence rather than it being assumed. These instances will always be included in proper HIPAA compliance documentation as retaining investigation proof is a mandated process.

  :post: |-
    Certain tasks simply cannot be addressed efficiently when done manually. With the appropriate technology, hospitals and healthcare entities can move beyond the limitations of random and manual audits. Now, patient privacy monitoring can be automated.

    Automation implementation through technology helps healthcare organizations investigate and track breaches more efficiently as well. Reports on unauthorized access attempts to patient medical records are generated in addition to enacted practices to prevent another breach. Having automated solutions for integrating and correlating access to PHI across various healthcare systems ensures the simplest and most effective way to streamline all processes and procedures that ensure compliance. The OCR HIPAA audits and the HIPAA Omnibus Rule mandate healthcare organizations have live practices that prove a hospital is able to monitor and react to patient records access.

    When evaluating technology for a patient privacy-monitoring program, the following checklist can ensure the selected system is capable of critical capabilities:

    1. Key monitoring of all patient records access: By automatically aggregating audit logs from across the entire organization and providing single search queries and proactive auditing
    2. Catching and resolving single as well as recurring breaches in real-time: It is important that inappropriate activity be spotted as it happens by proactively auditing all access to patient records
    3. Documenting breach investigations and their resolution: With a centralized and automated system, information required for documenting all investigation and their resolutions can be easily provided for fulfilling notification requirements
    4. Providing reporting per state and federal guidelines: Helps in the creation of a centralized, comprehensive environment for reviewing documented findings and providing insight into areas that require additional security measures and/ or employee education
    5. Documenting the release of medical records: When releasing medical records, a HIPAA violation can occur in so many ways and it is important that there is a procedure in place to document and track their release
    6. Accounting for disclosures: Hospitals and business associates are required to address all PHI disclosures, and the process must be able to track and document the disclosures in a central repository
    7. Meeting MACRA requirements of patient privacy: Should allow hospitals to implement policies and procedures for preventing, detecting, containing and correcting security violations.

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
