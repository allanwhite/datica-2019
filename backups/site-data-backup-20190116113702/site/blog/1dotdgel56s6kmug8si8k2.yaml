  :description: FHIR is the latest standard to be developed under the HL7 organization.
    Pronounced 'Fire' , FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
    I think it's the most interesting standard to have come out of HL7 since the original
    HL7 protocol.

:summary: 'Mark Olschesky shares what he learned, saw, and enjoyed at the 2nd annual
  HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. Hint: FHIR is fast becoming a reality.'
:blog_lead: I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at the
  2nd [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable](http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/roundtable/2017/03/).
  This topped my must-attend 2017 events after I attended the first event last fall
  in Boston. Here's what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.
:post: "## A Recap of the HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable\n\n### Datica's presentation\nI
  presented a demonstration of Datica, highlighting how vendors and innovation groups
  can use [Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) to build applications
  that aggregate hospital registration and scheduling feeds along with vitals and
  results from multiple organizations. They can then build the longitudinal patient
  records in an easy to query method. Of course, the underlying data storage format
  and query mechanisms are those provided by FHIR. It's an effective catalyst for
  companies building a new product that relies on data integration, especially from
  disparate sources. If you need to facilitate faster application development for
  you or your team, let us know and we’ll schedule a demo.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/MpnXJGu24MqkQo88WOWMu/f737b76a63cf82ad05e296baaa631752/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo.jpg)\n
  \n### More live demos\nWhile the last FHIR Applications Roundtable featured many
  \"conceptual\" demonstrations of applications, during this second roundtable we
  saw more applications directly embedded into EHRs; presenters demonstrated their
  apps within the Cerner and Epic EHRs. After this year’s presentations, I can say
  with even more certainty that FHIR is for real.\n \n### Real-life use cases for
  PHRs and patient-initiated interoperability\nPersonal Health Records (PHRs) have
  existed for years, but often lacked true utility due to their inability to integrate
  directly with EHRs and their associated patient portals. As such, most PHRs operated
  via manual patient entry of their data into the PHR software. This had changed.
  Multiple demos showed how PHRs could use SMART on FHIR to access data from multiple
  EHRs and patient portals, all with permissions and scope set by the patient. Live
  demos highlighted this functionality, including one given by Michele Mottini from
  CareEvolution showing access of data from Cedars-Sinai My CS-Link (powered by Epic's
  MyChart). As someone who operates primarily on the B2B side of interoperability
  but yearned for real solutions around patient-initiated interoperability, seeing
  that patients will have the ability to aggregate data from multiple portals and
  hospitals soon is exciting. A hat tip to Epic and Cerner for making this happen.\n
  \n### Need for API management\nA few vendors provided presentations on how access
  controls could be layered on top of FHIR for more pragmatic management of FHIR resources.
  It seems like [EMR vendors are remaining hands-off](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
  in this space, leading other vendors to rush in to fill the gap in API management
  (including Datica!).\n \n### People from all sides of the healthcare technology
  spectrum\nThe ability to talk to employees from startups, publicly-traded companies,
  hospitals and payers, life sciences and pharma all in the same place is amazing
  at the Apps Roundtable. Once again, [people are investing time and resources in
  FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/). A data standard is only
  as good as its utility and more and more companies are pledging to utilize it. As
  someone who wants to see interoperability improved through pragmatic standards-based
  integration, this provides hope that we'll get there.\n\n### Duke is lovely\nAfter
  things wrapped up on Wednesday, I meandered around the Medical School. Taking a
  short walk from the hospital towards the Duke Chapel and Gardens on a nice sunny
  day provided a peaceful environment only steps from the hospital.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/32c1t5oUPSUSScGW0UM2gi/175e508b0ac48fb5a8492063b591199b/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior.jpg)\n\nDatica
  is a proud member of the [HL7 organization](http://www.hl7.org/). Basing our integration
  and data management approaches around standards like FHIR gives our customers the
  best chance at being future-proof vs. proprietary data formats built by other vendors.
  These HL7 events gives us a first-hand look at what others are working on and how
  we can help make that happen with Datica Compliant Cloud.\n\n*Get the guide to open

    1. Discover why other vertical developers have avoided developing within healthcare and why FHIR changes that
    2. Get the inside scoop on timing of FHIR production use case estimates
    3. Become educated on what FHIR won’t help you solve
    4. Learn more about the Argonaut Project and the role it plays with the new standards development
  :post: |-
    **On why FHIR changes things for one developer outside of healthcare:** "THAT I can work with. I look at it and it’s a language I can read; it’s something that I’m happy to build to, because it makes complete sense with the way I’ve been doing internet technology in other sectors."

    **On why those outside healthcare start with patient facing apps:** "They seem to approach it from the patient perspective, in part because they are not working from the inside out, so that’s their point of access in the healthcare system."

    **On predictions around production timing:** "I think we’ll start to see that as people get certified to meet a particular use case related to a consumer-facing API, we’ll put more and more specific things into production, maybe later this year and certainly in 2017. There’s increasing demand that I’m always surprised by.

    **On the Argonaut Project:** "We have a growing an implementation community, which is 90+ organization who have enrolled in the implementation community. I don’t want to pretend that we have 90 active participants every week. That’s the reality of these kinds of things — there’s a lot of interest and participation at different levels, according to what their needs are."

    "The whole purpose of the Argonaut Project was to say let’s take the work that is being done at the standards level and see what we can do to accelerate a subset of the broader FHIR that’s being developed through the standards development organization HL7."

    **On what FHIR won’t solve:** "The things that [FHIR] won’t solve is disincentives or lack of incentives that exist in the market for exchanging information in the first place. It doesn't solve any of those things."

    **On whether FHIR will replace HL7 version 2:** "One thing I can say with confidence is even if it does, it's going to be a very long transition process. I think we'll have version 2 point-to-point interface transactions in place for a long time, in part because they are pretty rock solid and they work, and they are in place today. It's the classic "if it's not broken, don't fix it."

    **On the key stakeholder who might put patient-generated data to use:  "**Everyone wants to upload their FitBit data somewhere and they are discovering that their doctors really don't want it. What if CVS said, ‘Send your FitBit stuff to me. I have a team of epidemiologist and others and fancy algorithms that will do a lot of the signal-to-noise analysis and you tell us who your PCP is and we will tell your PCP when we see something that they should be concerned about.’ And then patients trust CVS even more and they are tied in even more with CVS."

    as your #1 FHIR resource  as we remain an industry leader on HIPAA compliant integration.

'
  :post: "In our documentation we discuss what makes FHIR so promising—starting with
    what makes its foundation solid:\r\n\r\n- A simpler way to exchange data without
    the inflexible workflow of other HL7 standards.\r\n- Utilization of a direct RESTful
    style.\r\n- The heavy emphasis on connectathons, convention and referral implementations,
    etc. as an integral part of the FHIR process.\r\n- Focus on targeting almost all
    common use cases in contrast to the minority of exceptions.\r\n\r\nBut even more
    valuable and important than the technical factors that create its base are the
    components that FHIR addresses that enables persons to generate and reserve more
    funds with the key operators being:\r\n\r\n- Medical device integration\r\n- Mobile
    healthcare applications + the cloud\r\n- A highly flexible and customizable workflow\r\n\r\nFHIR
    realistically could be the pilot for new and improved efficiencies. For vendors
    like Catalyze, FHIR brings new opportunity to offer value to our business partners,
    and for the end users, FHIR will provide leading-edge methods for streamlining
    patient care and lowering the final costs. \r\n\r\nFor all of this and more, go

  :summary: 'The buzz at HIMSS 2017: analytics, machine learning, AI, cyber-security,
    patient-centered care, and open data were a few themes we saw this year.'
  :blog_lead: "[HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/) is done. It’s time for
    the outpouring of commentaries on the event. And, amazingly, it’s already time
    to be thinking about next year if you’re an exhibitor. I realize the big companies
    do this but, at Datica, we too are planning and already booked our booth for next
    year. Thankfully we got a good booth space on the top floor and not in the basement
    (Vegas needs 2 levels to support HIMSS whereas Orlando only needs one massive
    level)."
  :post: "\n## Major Themes\n\nYou could have predicted these going into the event
    based on the sessions and promotional material.\n\n- **Analytics / machine learning
    / AI**. If I was to only pick one theme this year, this would be it. From Watson
    to Health Catalyst to the population health offerings of pretty much every EHR
    vendor, some form of analytics was woven into everything this year. Like patient
    engagement, a recurring HIMSS theme, [data analytics](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-benefits-of-accessible-big-data-analytics/)
    is seen as a major part of the future of care. Analytics does hold amazing potential
    but, like patient engagement, health systems need to develop strategies for how
    and where to use analytics if they are going to be successful. Analytics for analytics
    sake won’t help. Understanding the problems to solve or questions to answer with
    analytics is the key first step.\n- **Cybersecurity**. As more and more traditional
    health data goes digital, and more and more digital health data is generated by
    sensors and apps, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger topic. More health data flowing
    into more places means more financial risk of a [data breach](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    Cybersecurity is an essential part of digital health, just like cloud is an essential
    part of digital health. This should be a recurring theme of HIMSS as the next
    10 years are going to be defined by healthcare moving data between new technologies
    and between new partnerships.\n- **Patient-centered care**. This is the one I
    wasn’t sure if I should include because I feel like some variation of this has
    been a recurring theme. I guess being a constant theme still makes it a theme.
    The idea of [patient centricity](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-cmio-role-in-the-era-of-value-based-care/),
    maybe because it has been a constant theme, is starting to mature. Services need
    to be centered on patients, and many of those services will be technology driven.
    The reason for services need to be patient-centered is 1) that’s what patients
    expect today and 2) that is what providers, payors, and life sciences need to
    do to compete for patients, members, and customers. I think we’ve swung back from
    the days when we thought B2C, or going direct to consumer, would work across most
    patient populations. Groups like Healthgrades still own a lot of consumer health
    traffic but integrating those consumer tools with providers and more formal care
    is also a part of patient centricity. \n- **Open data**. This one definitely isn’t
    new. I remember hearing [Todd Park beating the drum about *data liberación*](http://healthstandards.com/blog/2015/06/23/data-liberacion/)
    back in 2011. It only took three more years for most EHR vendors to start to get
    behind a new standard called FHIR and another three or so years, until today,
    when EHRs are ready to expose data via FHIR. I’m bullish on FHIR as a potential
    data standard but highly skeptical of FHIR as a path to open data and innovation.
    We have projects like Argonaut driving towards new ways to use FHIR so we’ll have
    to wait and see how those develop. The overwhelming sentiment around open data
    is that access to data, ideally in a trusted and consistent bi-directional way,
    is the only way to build the technology ecosystem that’s needed to put patients
    at the center of care and start to drive towards the [triple aim].\n\n## Same
    same, but different\n\nThere’s a saying I first heard in Thailand and use from
    time to time - [*same same but different*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish).
    I think it pretty accurately describes my impression of HIMSS 2017.\n\nStepping
    back, looking at HIMSS as a whole, it felt like we had simply transported all
    the infrastructure and logistics from Vegas in 2016 to Orlando in 2017. It didn’t
    really feel too [much different from HIMSS 2015](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/himss-2015-recap/),
    for that matter. [HIStalkapalooza](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/visit-the-datica-vip-area-at-histalkapalooza-2017/)
    happened. The Athena party happened. Lots of bankers parties with better food
    and drink options. Uber didn’t work well. Restaurants were full all the time.
    Epic, Cerner, Athena and a few others still had the largest booths. Yeah, it felt
    like HIMSS.\n\nBut then, in other ways, it felt very different from previous years.
    The impression I got, on a consistent basis, is that people are burned out on
    the status quo. People are tired of HIMSS being the same year after year. People
    are tired of \"doing things to check boxes\", a reference to buying EHRs to get
    money from Meaningful Use, and \"want to really start making things happen\".
    These quotes are from people at large health systems, people in the same roles
    that would have said something like \"Epic is going to do that\" when asked about
    patient engagement or population health or pretty much anything health IT just
    a few years ago. These are decision makers at the core of the health IT industry
    and not just startups and investors. The tide has very clearly turned in the industry.\n\nThis
    is exciting! It will take time to see how quickly this sea change practically
    takes hold and we start to see more and more digital health technologies adopted
    and scaled at health systems. But, the process is starting and big systems are
    developing strategies and processes for the next 3-5 years. And, maybe the most
    shocking part, especially compared to several years ago, is that health systems
    are looking outside their EHR vendors for the future of health IT.\n\n*Want to

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
