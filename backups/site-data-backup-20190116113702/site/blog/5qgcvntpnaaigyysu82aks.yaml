:blog_lead: _FierceHealthcare_ reporter Susan D. Hall outlined some important challenges
  for digital health in a recent [article](http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/it/amid-opportunities-digital-health-poses-challenges-for-cardiology)
  titled, "Amid opportunities, digital health poses challenges for cardiology." The
  article covers three challenges. One, the need for the onslaught of healthcare data
  to be better aggregated in context for doctors and patients alike. Two, the challenge
  of proving mobile health applications' efficacy as a stand-alone therapeutic.
:post: "However, her third point about a need for gathering strong evidence around
  mobile health applications is the one Datica is hearing about most. Two physicians
  we recently interviewed expressed similar concerns. In a recent [_Healthcare Innovators
  Podcast_][2], Datica CEO Travis Good, MD interviewed Dr. Mark Shapiro, a hospitalist
  from San Diego, as well as the host of [_Explore the Space_][3] podcast. Dr. Shapiro
  shared his thoughts about the dilemma physicians face when called upon to recommend
  applications without thorough industry validation of those devices.\n\nShapiro also
  used Theranos, the blood-testing startup example, to illustrate why he isn't a first
  adopter of technology. \"As [applications] become more fully vetted, and we do get
  some clinical data to support their utility, as well as their safety and efficacy,
  I'm on board; I'm in. I'm not the guy that is going to stand on the lawn saying
  I don't want technology coming my way, but we need to be prudent.\" He explained
  that as a physician, those recommendations take on a whole new level of meaning
  when used to make big decisions about a life. \"When [using] very powerful diagnostic
  information from something, we need to be sure of where it is coming from and its
  quality before we implement it on a large scale.\"\n\nPrimary care physician, informatics
  researcher and entrepreneur Ida Sim, MD, PhD expressed a correlating sentiment in
  her recent interview for the _Healthcare Innovators Podcast_. \"Obviously as a system,
  we need to think about which are the right apps, which are the best sensors, how
  accurate they are and how validated; that's something we need to do as an industry.\"\n\nDr.
  Sim's podcast interview will be published next week and offers a first-hand look
  at what physicians are thinking through as they face the real possibility of incorporating
  a new source of information â€” patient-generated data. Grab your headphones, pen
  and paper for notes, because her insights on where this data should or could be
  stored are ones that all digital health vendors, EHR companies and healthcare providers
  should listen to and record.  \n\nIf you aren't following the wealth of thought
