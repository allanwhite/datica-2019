:summary: 'For the first time in twenty years, hospitals, vendors, and even payers
  and life sciences providers agree on something: FHIR is the way forward.'
:blog_lead: The hype about [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)
  has spread like, well, wildfire. The healthcare industry is often targeted by new,
  sexy technologies that sound great on the surface but often have few practical implementations.
  FHIR is NOT one of those technologies. In fact, FHIR has many practical use cases
  and benefits. More importantly, for the first time in twenty years, healthcare organizations,
  vendors, and even payers and life sciences providers agree this is the path forward
  for modern integration. This prevalent support is speeding FHIR’s adoption and feedback
  loop on improvement. Datica’s newest guide, [What Health Systems can Gain from FHIR
  Adoption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/), takes a candid look
  at the factors fueling open-data transformation at hospitals and health systems.
  Here are a few highlights from the guide.
:post: "\n## EHR’s aren’t cutting it. \n\nHospitals, in particular, are looking for
  technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have accomplished
  what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order to improve accessibility
  of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally stored and can be viewed
  across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR implementations laid the information
  technology groundwork that would become the fabric of a healthcare transformation
  movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis Good wrote in a recent blog post on the
  [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
  the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
  \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
  with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
  And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
  solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do not,
  reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new solutions
  than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking this organizational
  transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The industry has been focused
  on interoperability for the reason that being able to access the aggregated data
  is the only way to move from documentation tools to innovative care delivery models.
  An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single implementation of the standard
  [in a centralized data hub](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/managed-integration/) is the most
  efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients expect
  transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once were. They
  expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience because of their
  experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that patients are consumers
  in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
  of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare – has
  changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
  did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a mortgage.
  Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes, and clear,
  transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is what people
  have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n## Government
  mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are going to be
  required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.  We’ve seen references
  to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
  [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
  Century Cures legislation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
  The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
  in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
  providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
  and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
  for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
  on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
  and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health Systems
  can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
  to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables in
  health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational improvement
  perspective.\n\n"

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
