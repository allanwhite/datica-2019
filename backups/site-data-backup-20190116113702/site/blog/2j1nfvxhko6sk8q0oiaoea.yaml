:summary: Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population at
  a significantly reduced cost is the basis for innovation of most healthcare systems.
:blog_lead: "Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population
  at a significantly reduced cost is the ultimate dream of most healthcare systems.
  [Innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) is the key to being able to provide
  that healthcare excellence but there are socioeconomic needs that need to be addressed
  first. The healthcare innovation model has been largely driven by copious amounts
  of research and development to construct new technologies and processes, which can
  prove to be very costly. Healthcare spending is already skyrocketing as more Americans
  are getting sicker, so just as there is a desire for disruptive technologies, a
  disruptive approach to innovation is warranted. Frugal innovation will be the approach
  that delivers more social and economic benefits while utilizing fewer resources
  and promoting affordability, sustainability, accessibility, and quality. \n"
:post: "\nFrugal innovation, falling in sync with the industry’s transition from volume
  to value care, will mandate a preference towards simplicity over sophistication.
  Healthcare solutions that are easier to use are more accessible, demand little maintenance,
  and are less expensive. Sometimes the simplest ideas truly are the best. It pays
  to also consider what is already applicable in a patient’s present environment,
  so review what technologies and processes could potentially be repurposed to solve
  another existing need. This will allow you to compensate for what is scarce with
  what is abundant. Providers should be exercising their already existing resources,
  like mobile and satellite connectivity, to deliver care better, faster, and cheaper.
  \n\nPublic and private sectors of healthcare need to collaborate together to increase
  their community impact. Amalgamating knowledge and networks will allow for further
  reach into any endeavor. Healthcare pockets of excellence will stay just that, assisting
  a small portion of populations instead of providing support to those who could truly
  benefit from the advancements. Adopting a collaboration [solution platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/)
  that will allow for higher engagement from professionals and patients alike to fix
  what needs fixing. Ultimately, co-operating between sectors will allow for frugal
  innovation to take place resulting in co-creation of sustainable and affordable
  health solutions that benefit a larger populace. \n"

  :summary: Private, Public, and Hybrid clouds all exist in healthcare. Hybrid clouds
    represent the largest area of growth in healthcare organizations.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

    <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">
    <img src="https://images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1OrH0GVvn2iAaqGuOMi66U/65b0f7f0407c6229bca3561517303c53/report-infographic-preview-sq.jpg?w=300" alt="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" class="float-right" width="150" >
    </a>

    We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
  :post: |+
    ## Shift to IaaS

    For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

    Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

    The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

    * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
    * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

    That's a remarkable jump.

    ## Data Data Everywhere

    The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

    Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

    Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

    ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

    What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

    The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

    The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

    ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

    |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
    |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
    |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
    |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
    |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
    |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

    ## What this means to healthcare

    We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

    We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.

  :summary: 'These big ideas in healthcare innovation explore a lack of interoperability,
    the role of EHRs, and how data standards like FHIR ignite transformation. '
  :blog_lead: "Connectedness is the final frontier for healthcare. In many ways, the
    true breakthrough for innovation will come once interoperability becomes the default
    instead of the barrier it has been for several decades. With that focus, we recently
    compiled the six biggest ideas from the 2016 Datica Healthcare Innovation Series
    into a [third annual report](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/2016/). The report
    explores the history behind the lack of interoperability, the role EHRs play,
    and what new data standards, like FHIR, can do ignite true transformation. \n\nSince
    2014, this continuing [interview series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) has sought
    to understand how innovation happens in healthcare. Nine of the greatest minds
    in healthcare share their insights about data standards and integration principles
    in the complete 2016 annual report. These six ideas are a summation of the thoughts
    in the report."
  :post: "## Six Big Ideas\n\n### 1. Innovation is a global endeavor. \n\n> “If you
    talk only to yourself, you stay the way you are... If you talk only to others
    in healthcare, you move with the pack... It’s only if you talk outside of your
    domain that you can leap boundaries.” — Mark Smith, MD\n\nOne truth about new
    ideas is they are typically the combination of existing ideas. Therefore the greatest
    innovations are spurred by bumping together diverse thinkers with diverse backgrounds.
    The more this happens, the higher probability true innovation will occur. The
    takeaway: global minds, often outside of healthcare, are some of the best sources
    of healthcare innovation at the national level.\n\n### 2. Part of the challenge
    of technology adoption is due to the difficulty in understanding and absorbing
    the technology.\n\n> “When I talk to implementors in the FHIR community about
    this, there’s this thing that goes around about RESTful APIs — the 5-5-5 rule
    — 5 seconds to find the API, 5 minutes to understand what it was doing and 5 hours
    to have something working. But to that I add, 5 years to begin to understand healthcare.”
    — Grahame Grieve \n\nWhether it’s the native complexity of the standard or the
    poor documentation that is behind the times, traditional data standards have not
    been inviting to energetic entrepreneurial problem solvers. The barrier to adoption
    is a subtle yet underrated consideration when wondering why interoperability isn’t
    better than its current state. The good news: FHIR tries to tackle this problem
    head on.\n\n### 3. The pace of FHIR adoption has been insanely fast (by healthcare
    standards). \n> ”[FHIR has] reached a point of adoption where there is enough
    critical mass to ensure that its APIs can be the standard and the usefulness of
    the platform can be assured.” -Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD\n\nHealthcare is rightfully
    skeptical of the hot newness. For decades it has been told what new technology
    or process will save the day. While FHIR doesn’t solve all the problems, there
    is an industry view that FHIR truly is a breakthrough moment on interoperability.
    The data behind the swelling sentiment is the rate of adoption across sub-domains,
    across vendors, and across use cases, as well as being embraced by the government.\n\n###
    4. More data is not necessarily the answer to innovation because it’s often useless
    data. \n> “Doctors are rightfully skeptical in getting all your Fitbit or whatnot
    data because it doesn’t fit the way we generally use data.” -Ida Sim, MD, PhD\n\nThe
    unacceptable state of interoperability is often viewed as the biggest blocker
    to innovation. Exchanging data really is the key to the next healthcare transformation.
    Yet the other side of the coin—the deluge of data that is exchanged but is actually
    relatively useless—can be just as much of a depressant on innovation.\n\n### 5.
    The EHR must be a partner to the rest of healthcare.\n\n> “The government has
    spent somewhere between twenty to thirty billion dollars on EMR deployment and
    there is a little bit of embarrassment and concern why these things aren’t interoperable.”
    -Dr. Mark Braunstein\n\nShared incentives have not always been present for EHR
    vendors. While they have been the core driver in the most important transformation
    so far—the digitization of health data—they have not behaved in a way that contributes
    to increased interoperability and true innovation. In their defense, it’s not
    necessarily their fault: the economic incentives have not been present, and Meaningful
    Use didn’t enforce it. But that does not excuse the growing sentiment that EHR
    vendors must embrace being at the forefront of the next wave of transformation.\n\n###
    6. Healthcare’s situations are unique.\n\n> “The challenges that we face are always
    the ones that have confronted us in my three plus decades for caring for patients—policy.”
    -Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD\n\nThis is not a ground-breaking thought: healthcare is
    unique from every other industry in the economy because of its combination of
    regulatory, economic, political, security, privacy, and complexity pressures—not
    to mention we are dealing with people’s lives, not tweets. But, it is important
    to be reminded that these situations exist, and healthcare innovation is predicated
    on managing the uniqueness up front.\n\nWe invite you to read the complete report
    for many more great insights on innovation."

  :summary: 'For the first time in twenty years, hospitals, vendors, and even payers
    and life sciences providers agree on something: FHIR is the way forward.'
  :blog_lead: The hype about [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)
    has spread like, well, wildfire. The healthcare industry is often targeted by
    new, sexy technologies that sound great on the surface but often have few practical
    implementations. FHIR is NOT one of those technologies. In fact, FHIR has many
    practical use cases and benefits. More importantly, for the first time in twenty
    years, healthcare organizations, vendors, and even payers and life sciences providers
    agree this is the path forward for modern integration. This prevalent support
    is speeding FHIR’s adoption and feedback loop on improvement. Datica’s newest
    guide, [What Health Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    takes a candid look at the factors fueling open-data transformation at hospitals
    and health systems. Here are a few highlights from the guide.
  :post: "\n## EHR’s aren’t cutting it. \n\nHospitals, in particular, are looking
    for technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have
    accomplished what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order
    to improve accessibility of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally
    stored and can be viewed across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR
    implementations laid the information technology groundwork that would become the
    fabric of a healthcare transformation movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis
    Good wrote in a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
    the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
    \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
    with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
    And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
    solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do
    not, reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new
    solutions than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking
    this organizational transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The
    industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason that being able to
    access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation tools to
    innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single
    implementation of the standard [in a centralized data hub](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/managed-integration/)
    is the most efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients
    expect transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once
    were. They expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience
    because of their experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that
    patients are consumers in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
    of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare –
    has changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
    did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a
    mortgage. Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes,
    and clear, transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is
    what people have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n##
    Government mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are
    going to be required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.
    \ We’ve seen references to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
    [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
    Century Cures legislation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
    The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
    in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
    providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
    and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
    for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
    on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
    and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health
    Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables
    in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
