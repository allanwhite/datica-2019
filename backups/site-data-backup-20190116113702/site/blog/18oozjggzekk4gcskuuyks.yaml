:summary: Minimizing risk and maximizing protections for patient data.
:blog_lead: 'It might seem strange but communicating directly with individuals about
  their health is a pretty new concept. It''s part of larger trends in healthcare
  that put the patient in more control of their data, and make the patient a more
  informed and active member of the care team. Patient activation and engagement are
  not the subjects of this post, though they are near and dear to our hearts at Catalyze.

'
:post: "Whatever the reason driving new forms of communication and touch points with
  patients, the privacy and security aspects of HIPAA make healthcare communication
  different from personal communication in other verticals. It's not quite as easy
  to implement 2-way SMS with your physician as it is for your wireless carrier to
  do SMS surveys for feedback. One of the things that makes HIPAA really interesting,
  and really challenging in some respects, is its flexibility. Much of HIPAA, especially
  the Security Rule, isn't prescriptive about the specific types of technologies that
  need to be used, or the specific settings for systems used to transmit, process,
  or store protected health information (PHI). On top of that, HIPAA allows patients
  to opt-in or agree to certain types of communication as long as those patients are
  given a basic understanding of the risk associated with those communication mediums.
  Many patients are OK with emails, or even SMS messages, for health. It's certainly
  much more efficient and effective than the paper mail that dominates healthcare
  today.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a very interesting [project](http://www.medstartr.com/projects/188-hacking-hipaa),
  which didn't get funded, set out to create a standards Notice of Privacy Practices
  (NPP) that would standardize the way in which patients choose communication preferences.
  Unfortunately the project didn't reach it's funding goals but the idea to create
  standard processes and language for patient privacy preference is well timed.\r\n\r\nSo
  theoretically you, as an individual, could opt-in to receiving PHI through SMS (\"Hello
  Mr. Smith! It's time to take your lisinopril. Reply 1 if taken, 2 if not.\"), despite
  the fact that SMS violates some prescriptive HIPAA security rules around encryption.
  That' great! And it's very helpful for healthcare developers and enterprises that
  want to engage patients because snail mail or portal mail (where uses have to log
  in to a secure portal to access a message) do not equal stickiness for an engagement
  campaign.\r\n\r\nBut having a patient opt-in to SMS or email or Push or any number
  of other delivery methods does not mean that the technology behind the message can
  violate the HIPAA security rule. It also doesn't mean the patient opted-out of the
  same security controls associated with handling ePHI. It just means that SMS can
  be used to deliver health-related messages to the patient.\r\n\r\nSMS is a good
  example because there are very successful, and popular, SMS delivery services, Twilio
  and Plivo being the biggest, that can be used to deliver SMS (or voice). But, according
  to the new HIPAA Omnibus rules, those delivery services are still considered subcontractors
  and subject to the same rules and risks of any other business associate in the eyes
  of HIPAA and HHS. ePHI passes through, and is typically queued, on systems while
  awaiting delivery. Email delivery is very similar to SMS in these ways, just replace
  Twilio and Plivo with Mailgun and Postmark. Push too.\r\n\r\nSo what can you do
  as a developer? It's a matter of being thoughtful about who you work with and understanding
  where PHI flows. Many infrastructure companies understand the unique needs in healthcare
  and the broadened scope of HIPAA. But, at the same time, you have to be proactive
  when you work with vendors to assure you minimize risk and maximize protections
  for patient data.\r\n\r\n"
