:summary: Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
  key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
  epic transformations.
:blog_lead: 'Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
  key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
  epic transformations. Today’s healthcare CIO can come from a myriad of backgrounds
  since IT is no longer a prerequisite for the position. Rather than a technical nature,
  a business-oriented mindset is crucial in order for healthcare CIOs to be strategic
  and manage the system’s financial metrics. With the healthcare industry shifting
  gears and the CIOs no longer narrowly focusing on the technology, what is included
  in the scope of work for the modern healthcare CIO?

'
:post: "## Population Health Management\n\nForward-thinking healthcare leaders have
  been actively pursuing population health management objectives. These objectives
  pertain to some of the most challenging cohorts that the twenty-first-century CIO
  has fully embraced. Proven solutions show that data analytics play a vital role
  in providing insight into individuals and populations, assuring that standardized,
  actionable, and substantial healthcare delivery information is received. The CIO
  of healthcare systems has the power to leverage influence to shift the quality of
  human health across entire segments of the population. The key challenges faced
  involve data: patient ascertainment, stratification, and analytics for exertions
  or interventions. \n\n## Strategic Interoperability\n\nA lot of buzz around interoperability
  has been happening since 2013 and for justifiable cause. Interoperability addresses
  some of healthcare’s most pressing plights so the demand for achieving interoperability
  is only on the rise. Despite this severe imposition, most healthcare organizations
  have only begun their journey to achieving interoperability. \n\nIntegration engines
  are what most healthcare organizations currently use to enable simplistic messaging
  between systems. This fits the homogenous nature of the [HL7v2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/)
  standard. Having your integration capabilities entirely behind the hospital's firewall
  is no longer enough as interoperability requires a more strategic stance. These
  organizations need an interoperability solution that can facilitate strategic growth
  plans through acquisitions and mergers. Interoperability not only has become an
  industry-level issue but is also a prerequisite for success in other healthcare
  initiatives such as coordinated care, patient engagement, and [enterprise innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/).
  \n\n## Big Data Analytics\n\nIn the CIO’s domain, an ever-growing scope of data
  is overseen, distributed among multiple divergent systems, both in structured and
  unstructured configurations. Never seen before, content from social media and text
  messages can be found in a patient’s health record, contributing to the volume,
  momentum, and diversity of data. With all of the latest technologies in mobile devices,
  physician dashboards, telehealth, etc., CIOs are faced with one of the greatest
  HIT challenges of aggregating, normalizing, and integrating all of that Big Data
  down to the actionable direction at the time of care. CIOs are being looked upon
  to make this data interoperable, support engagement, and coerce the proper exploits
  by understanding the data from a technical and cultural framework. \n\nWant to read

    ## Bringing HITRUST CSF Certification to AWS

    Datica's compliant cloud platform is now HITRUST CSF Certified for its customers hosting workloads on [Amazon Web Services][1] (AWS). Datica passed its Common Security Framework (CSF) assessment from the Health Information Trust Alliance ([HITRUST][2]) — the industry's benchmark for measuring compliance and security. By utilizing AWS services and solutions, Datica provides a fully managed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified platform for the healthcare industry that offers development teams fast, flexible, and secure access to the cloud.

    "Healthcare is an industry in the midst of transitioning to the cloud, and AWS is strategically positioned to service the healthcare industry's computing needs. AWS's work with Datica, a company that focuses on meeting healthcare's unique compliance needs through security frameworks like HITRUST, helps position AWS to play a key role in the health industry's transformation," said Josh Hofmann, Global Lead, Partner Ecosystem, Amazon Web Services, Inc.

    ## HL7 Roundtable & The Future of Healthcare Conferences

    Hosted at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA this week, is the [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable][4]. [Mark Olschesky][5], Datica Chief Data Officer, will be giving a presentation on Using Datica Redpoint's FHIR Hub for Interoperability. The SMART on FHIR®-enabled Patient Engagement Solution from Healthwise leverages SMART standard to enable integration into EHRs. The solution leverages the Patient, Encounter, and other FHIR resources to retrieve patient context and pre-populate the Healthwise solution with relevant patient education recommendations for the clinician. Among Mark will be a diverse community of developers who have deployed real-world applications that will enable others to learn the capabilities of FHIR.

Datica Chief Strategy Officer [Casey Bryson][5] will be in attendance among other national and state health leaders to analyze trends, policies, and innovations, shaping Wisconsin's changing healthcare landscape. Panelists will discuss prevalence of partnerships, the intersection of healthcare and community population health, the impact of data and more.

    ## Cofounder Dr. Travis Good Featured in Becker's and Practice Mentors

    Is health IT really 'digital snake oil?' Eight industry leaders, including Dr. Travis Good, reacted to Dr. James Madara's speech and were featured in Becker's Health IT & CIO Review. Dr. Madara[ made the comparison][7] in his address at the 2016 AMA Annual Meeting. "From ineffective EHRs to an explosion of direct-to-consumer digital health products to apps, some of which are poor quality — this is the digital snake oil of the 21st century," he said. But not all stakeholders share Dr. Madara's criticism of the digital health landscape. Dr. Travis Good, among other healthcare stakeholders weighed in on "digital snake oil," and whether that's a fair description of the digital health landscape in [Becker's recent publication][8].

    As we all should know, compliance is mandatory. So stop and think about how many electronic devices you use everyday. Are they all HIPAA compliant? Are you assuming that others take care of that for you? Dr. Travis Good had the pleasure of being featured in the [Practice Mentors Podcast: Electronic Devices And HIPAA Compliance Is Mandatory][9]. You may be surprised as you listen to Travis Good and Kathleen Mills discuss the finer points of this topic. You'll want to know these safeguards to protect yourself from unwanted trouble that could end your practice.

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
