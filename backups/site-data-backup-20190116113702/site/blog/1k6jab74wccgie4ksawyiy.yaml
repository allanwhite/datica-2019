:summary: There's still a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about HITRUST,
  even among vendords and consultants. This article will clear up some of the confusion.
:blog_lead: Recently, I was surprised to see a handful of online posts from vendors
  and consultants about HITRUST, voicing opinions that don't quite match up with my
  understanding and experiences. The questions raised and inaccurate claims made showed
  me that there's still a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about HITRUST.
:post: "To understand where we are today, it's important to know where [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/)
  came from. After HIPAA was passed into law in 1996, the following decade or so was
  a confusing, disorganized morass in which the HIPAA Security Rule did not provide
  prescriptive measures for covered entities (CE) and [business associates (BA)](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
  Basically, these organizations were given the flexibility to implement comprehensive
  information security programs and analyze their own levels of risk — something many
  healthcare organizations had no experience with, so even those who did have programs
  had ones that were significantly less robust than they needed.\n\nIn 2007, leaders
  within the healthcare field — including CIOs, security and privacy officers from
  leading healthcare providers, insurers and vendors — came together to solve this
  problem. HITRUST initially developed an information security framework with the
  intentions of creating an industry standard, including control baselines so an organization
  could make their own choice based on their unique needs. Originally referred to
  as the [HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework),
  the CSF was developed specifically for healthcare — designed to be scalable, customizable
  and capable of providing certifiable risk assurances.\n\nToday, the HITRUST CSF
  is the most widely adopted information privacy and security risk management framework
  among healthcare organizations in the United States. In addition, many organizations
  outside of the U.S. have also implemented the HITRUST CSF.\n\nNaturally, there are
  always questions and concerns about paradigm-shifting approaches — especially when
  it concerns information security and privacy. Every day seems to bring more risk
  and news stories about hacks and breaches. So it makes complete sense for a group
  of experts to lead the charge and collaboratively build a security framework that
  can benefit the entire industry. \n\nWith that said, here are a few of the issues
  that I saw being discussed online — and my take on them:\n\n## Misconception #1:
  The HITRUST approach is too expensive — costing excessive money, time and resources.\n\nSome
  people forget how things used to be — when \"doing it yourself\" was expensive and
  time-consuming, usually with poor results. While a company usually starts with an
  inexpensive [HITRUST self-assessment](http://content.datica.com/what-is-a-hitrust-csf-self-assessment),
  that's just the first step. \n\nThe costs of a HITRUST-validated assessment are
  commensurate with a third-party assessment; and if you perform a comprehensive assessment
  of any type, the costs should be roughly equivalent. Although in many cases, the
  overall information privacy and security assessment costs can be substantially less
  because of the assess-once, report-many approach supported by the HITRUST CSF Assurance
  program. The alignment between the HITRUST CSF and CSF Assurance programs allows
  a single CSF Assessment report to support multiple objectives (such as a HIPAA risk
  assessment or an assessment against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework), and this
  same report can be accepted by multiple external parties (business partners, government
  agencies, etc.) — reducing the costs associated with multiple assessments. \n\nIn
  addition, a HITRUST CSF assessment will identify which controls will be evaluated
  and provide illustrative assessment procedures, which allow for better preparation
  — and potentially reducing costs. In addition, an organization can get a HITRUST
  CSF Validated report and a SOC 2 report based on one assessment, making the costs
  substantially less than doing two separate assessments.\n\nOf course, determining
  the ultimate value of a HITRUST CSF Assessment centers on the peace of mind found
  after going through the process — and knowing that a breach can cost millions of
  dollars. Also, what are the other options that would be comprehensive, relevant
  and consistent, while offering the needed transparency?  \n\nComparatively, the
  costs of the HITRUST approach are negligible. It might seem reductive to say, but
  the age-old question must be considered: \"How much are you willing to spend for
  peace of mind?\" Of course, more bottom-line-focused professionals simply have to
  look at the return on investment (ROI) to see the true value.\n\n## Misconception
  #2: It's unnecessarily burdensome to implement the HITRUST methodology.\n\nAs I
  mentioned above, the \"old way\" of establishing your own information security program
  was both undirected and cumbersome, costing tremendous amounts of time and money.
  To be sure, implementing the HITRUST CSF at my company took effort. \n\nBut all
  of us at Datica understand the importance of comprehensive risk management, and
  chose HITRUST to help us train for a higher level of information security and create
  the optimal organizational structure. \n\nWhile the assessment required significant
  time and resources to complete, the ability to satisfy multiple assessment and reporting
  requirements saved us both time and money in the long run. (Based on our experience,
  we also recommend designating a team member as the internal subject matter expert.)
  We truly believe it's more than worth the effort.\n\nOne of my esteemed colleagues,
  Lee Penn, is the CFO and Chief Compliance Officer at PDHI —  a SaaS company that
  develops and distributes the ConXus Platform for delivering workplace wellness and
  population health management programs. Lee — also a member of the HITRUST Business
  Associate Council — noted that his company had a similar experience to ours. He
  said that while it was time and resource-intensive — particularly so, as it was
  the first third-party attestation that PDHI had ever sought — they're a better company,
  with a more effective information privacy and security program for having made the
  effort to achieve certification under the HITRUST CSF. It's now part of the PDHI
  culture — and the resources they now save by not having to undergo repetitive assessments
  easily offsets the ongoing costs of maintaining the certification — while heightening
  PDHI's trustworthiness to its clients.\n\nWhile other methodologies use a simplistic
  and non-prescriptive \"red/yellow/green stoplight\" and costly, unique questionnaires
  — which most would agree provided too much wiggle room with compliance — HITRUST's
  more sophisticated scoring model provides better accuracy and precision than a checklist
  approach, and subsequently better assurances about the state of an organization's
  information protection, whether for use internally or by a third party. \n\n## Misconception
  #3: The results and efficacy of the HITRUST approach are questionable.\n\nQuite
  simply, nobody else reaches the level of quality assurance for third-party assessments
  as those conducted by HITRUST Assessors. And organizations now have over 50 assessors
  (a number that continues to grow) to choose from, so users can \"shop around\" and
  take advantage of free market dynamics to find one that meets their specific needs.
  \n\nI was recently speaking with Pamela Arora — senior vice president and chief
  information officer at Children's Health in Dallas — who has seen the same benefits
  from her organization's efforts as my own company. She observed that with the threat
  landscape continuously evolving, we must continue work to ensure our security programs
  protect patient and organizational data from end to end, because you're only as
  strong as your weakest link. Protecting data, she noted, is one of their highest
  priorities; therefore, if a partner goes through the third-party certification with
  HITRUST, they're able to be more confident that the organization's security posture
  is not eroded, since they know the partners also meet CSF security requirements.
  \  \n\nPamela recognizes that challenges exist. In some instances, an organization's
  culture may initially be resistant to pursuing certification, but with continued
  encouragement from the industry — and demonstration of the value in CSF certification
  — they're confident that potential resistance will ultimately melt away.\n\nClearly,
  the widespread adoption of the HITRUST CSF — which is used for everything from a
  \"best practices\" reference to the basis for a certifiable information protection
  program — demonstrates that the HITRUST approach works. If that's not enough evidence,
  a recent review by Allied World U.S. stated that [\"organizations that had obtained
  a HITRUST CSF Certification posed lower cyber-related risks than those organizations
  that have not.\"][1]\n\n## Misconception #4: Making HITRUST certification a requirement
  is unfair. \n\nThis complaint really confuses me — and I'm a vendor. There are many
  good reasons why organizations are requiring a HITRUST CSF certification of their
  business associates, and most of them positively benefit the business associates.
  Covered entities have been expanding and enhancing their information protection
  since passage of the HITECH ACT — a trend which has only been exacerbated by recent
  statistics on 3rd party-related breaches. \n\nThe result has been an increase in
  the number of requests for assessments or other forms of assurance — which are often
  different from one covered entity to another, and subsequently add cost and complexity
  to the healthcare system. Fortunately, this trend has been recognized by a growing
  number of covered entities, who have seen resources distracted from their own information
  protection programs to perform and evaluate assessments of their vendors and other
  business associates.\n\nFor organizations that have a strong information privacy
  and security program, undergoing a HITRUST CSF assessment is not a difficult process
  — and those that aren't committed to stronger privacy and security were not going
  to hide from a comprehensive assessment regardless. This way, they have a smart
  option that can be used more broadly across the industry. In fact, that's one of
  the roles of the HITRUST Business Associate Council — to ensure that vendors are
  fully engaging in the process and working more broadly with the industry (and even
  across industries) to ensure the HITRUST CSF Assessment reports are accepted. \n\n##
  The bottom line: Together, we can make things better.\n\nBuilding industry consensus
  on information protection methodologies and standards is what the [HITRUST Alliance](https://hitrustalliance.net/)
  is all about. It takes experienced, respected professionals to lead the way for
  improvements in any industry, and healthcare is no different. Professionals from
  every corner of the industry have provided — and continue to provide — their valuable
  time and insight. HITRUST welcomes active participation in its committees and working
  groups, and constructive feedback through its comment process from anyone in the
  field who would like to share their ideas for the betterment of us all. \n\nThe
  truth is that we're all in this together, and our common goal is the common good
  — protecting individually identifiable healthcare information. At every level, our
  industry has to embrace the shift to digital management of healthcare information,
  understand the risks involved in this change, and take appropriate steps to manage
  them. By working together, we can all focus on creating practical, reliable ways
  to improve security and minimize risk. In my view, HITRUST has taken a leading role
  in improving the state of information protection in the healthcare industry and
  is doing so efficiently and effectively.\n\n[1]: https://hitrustalliance.net/content/uploads/2016/02/HITRUST-CSF-AWAC-Cyber-Insurance-PR_final-for-wire.pdf"

  :blog_lead: |-
    HHS released it's official [Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing][1] last month. The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask. In some ways, it's HHS playing catchup to the industry. The cloud, while still early in terms of adoption in healthcare, is already heavily used for creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting ePHI. Look no further than [athenahealth][2], one of the largest EHR providers, for an example of a lot of ePHI in the cloud. Storing or moving data around different cloud-based services is becoming more and more commonplace.

    > A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity. - Dalai Lama

    Personally, I think HHS could and should play a more active and significant role in trends like cloud computing. I acknowledge it's hard to keep up with pace of technology in healthcare but there's still more HHS could do to engage with those leading these technical charges. That said, it's good to have official guidance from HHS.

    Yesterday I jointly conducted a webinar with [Coalfire][3]. Today I will recap some of the highlights, and pull out the salient points from the guidance and summarized them below. (_Note: CSP stands for cloud service provider._)

    * **Lacking encryption keys doesn't prevent you from being liable under HIPAA.** From the guidance, _This is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules._ This has been a claim by some CSPs and this is one of the most clear and relevant aspects of the HHS guidance. The claim by some CSPs is that, by not having the keys to decrypt ePHI, they are not a subcontractor or business associate. HHS says they are because they still store receive and maintain, even if that ePHI is encrypted and the CSP does not have the key to decrypt it. CSPs that fall into this bucket at considered _no-view services_ by HSS.
    * **But lacking keys does change obligations.** From the guidance, _In particular, where only the customer controls who is able to view the ePHI maintained by the CSP, certain access controls, such as authentication or unique user identification, may be the responsibility of the customer, while others, such as encryption, may be the responsibility of the CSP business associate._ This is the first I've seen HHS acknowledge—implicitly, at least—the concept of compliance inheritance for HIPAA. At Datica, we [pioneered][4] the concept of inheritance and still feel strongly that compliance inheritance is the best path to securing data, reducing risk of breach, and complying with HIPAA, in a cloud-based world.
    * **Lacking keys it could change breach reporting.** From the guidance, _If the ePHI that has been breached is encrypted consistent with the HIPAA standards set forth in 45 CFR § 164.402(2) and HHS' Guidance [13](#) the incident falls within the breach "safe harbor" and the CSP business associate is not required to report the incident to its customer._ This is significant as it changes breach reporting requirements for no-view CSPs, and breach reporting is a big part of HIPAA and a big part of what covered entities want to understand about their business associates and partners.
    * **All types of cloud configurations are ok for HIPAA.** From the guidance, _…while a covered entity or business associate may use cloud-based services of any configuration (public, hybrid, private, etc.), [3](#) provided it enters into a BAA with the CSP, the type of cloud configuration to be used may affect the risk analysis and risk management plans of all parties and the resultant provisions of the BAA._ NIST [defines][5] different cloud deployment models. The most common are public and private, or some mix of those two that NIST defines as hybrid. Organizations can comply with HIPAA using any deployment model but there are different risks associated with each and it is the job of the covered entity and business associate to properly assess the risk when selecting the proper deployment model. I would have preferred HHS go further and call out [single-tenant and multi-tenant in regards to HIPAA and cloud][6].
    * **SLAs need to align with BAAs.** From the guidance, _If a covered entity or business associate enters into a SLA with a CSP, it should ensure that the terms of the SLA are consistent with the BAA and the HIPAA Rules._ This is something that many business associates don't do but should. The core of this guidance is that the SLA from a CSP should ensure that access to ePHI is not restricted due to excessive downtime.
    * **Security and breach reporting should be very specifically defined.** From the guidance, _The Security Rule, however, is flexible and does not prescribe the level of detail, frequency, or format of reports of security incidents, which may be worked out between the parties to the business associate agreement (BAA)._ With ePHI moving between CSPs (think APIs and [Blank-as-a-Service][7]), it's imperative that each party knows what it is responsible for reporting. Reporting is essential to investigating and shutting off breaches.
    * **Cloud service providers do not need to store ePHI for some period of time.** From the guidance, _No, the HIPAA Rules generally do not require a business associate to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI) beyond the time it provides services to a covered entity or business associate._ This [not news][8] to us but it something that is frequently misunderstood about HIPAA so it's good that HHS called this out for CSPs.
    * **It's ok to use servers outside the USA.** From the guidance, _Yes, provided the covered entity (or business associate) enters into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the CSP and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules._ This surprised me a little. Not because I don't agree with HHS but because I have a hard time imagining the use case for this. We have global customers, particularly in the life sciences arena, who need global deployments. In those cases, we deploy separate apps and databases across different regions depending on where end users reside. All customers we have that work with US citizens are deployed in US data centers.
    * **Documentation of security practices is not required from cloud service providers.** From the guidance, _The HIPAA Rules do not expressly require that a CSP provide documentation of its security practices to or otherwise allow a customer to audit its security practices._ This type of documentation, while not required, may still be needed by covered entities and business associates based on the their determination of risk.

    ## What was not in the guidance?

    I think a few things were missing and that HHS didn't go far enough.

    1. **Define compliance inheritance.** I think HHS could go further here. HITRUST is a [good example][9] by incorporating the concept of inheritance into the CSF. Inheriting aspects of HIPAA is a core part of cloud deployments and should be addressed by HHS.
    2. **Address questions about multi-tenancy.** This is probably the most frequent question when it comes to ePHI + cloud. It would have been good to have official guidance as a part of the cloud guidance from HHS.
    3. **Start moving towards a universal, readable BAA.** The BAA [template][10] that HSS has on it's site, while useful in its generalizability, is too broad. There are things we know about the cloud and one of them, related to inheritance above, is that different parties can own different obligations. Creating a universal BAA, even if HHS is just the convener of industry leaders, would go a long way to helping healthcare move to the cloud in a safe way.

    Healthcare, and it's data and applications, are slowly but surely embracing the cloud. The recent guidance from HHS has gotten a lot of attention. Hopefully this summary was helpful. If you have any other questions, reach out to us at [hello@datica.com][11].

    costs.

    ### **Direct costs of becoming HITRUST CSF certified**

    A validated HITRUST Assessment that results in a HITRUST CSF Certification is a more complete, certified version of a HIPAA audit. It was created by large healthcare enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance programs. A standard web app is used to enter information and those entries are validated by a HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization, reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you _hopefully_ get HITRUST certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees to HITRUST and to your auditor, or approved assessor. The direct cost, at the low end, is about $40,000-$60,000 but costs can be much higher for larger organizations.

    ### **Indirect costs **of becoming HITRUST CSF certified****

    As Steve Jobs said, "the most precious resource we have is time" and indirect costs are harder to quantify. In regard to the Datica HITRUST assessment, we estimate the total time spent for all employees and have come to an estimate of 200 hours. Also necessary to consider is the time spent between each audit to address issues and solidify compliance and infosec programs. Though not captured for our HITRUST assessment, this contributes to the overall cost of compliance.

    ### **Total costs **of becoming HITRUST CSF certified****

    Conservatively estimating the cost of an hour of work to be $100/hour, a rough calculation can be tallied. With the cost of salaries, benefits and lost opportunities from work not performed simultaneously (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc) a partial loss must be considered. Based on those numbers, the total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is appraised $60,000 - $80,000. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For us, HITRUST Certification was a no brainer because audits are part of our value proposition to customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large deals. It's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews, sort of like miniature audits. These also cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
