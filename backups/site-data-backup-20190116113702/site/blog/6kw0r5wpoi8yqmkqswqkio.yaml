:summary: 'Are digital health apps consumer-facing, or used in a clinical setting?
  How are they improving patient outcomes? How are digital health apps integrated
  into clinicians’ workflows? '
:blog_lead: "Digital health is something of a buzzword in the industry right now,
  but evidence is emerging that digital health apps have the potential to both improve
  patient outcomes and [save money across the healthcare system](https://datica.com/blog/digital-health-apps-could-save-7-billion/).
  \n\n"
:post: "## What is a Digital Health Application? \n\nMobile health, or mHealth, is
  a type of digital health and is used within the larger context of what the World
  Health Organization (WHO) describes as electronic health. Apps, of course, are designed
  to be used with mobile devices.\n\nOne of the largest barriers for health organizations
  to adopting mHealth in past has been the issue of [changing reimbursement models](https://datica.com/blog/changing-reimbursement-means-new-opportunities/).
  Healthcare has been a fee-for-service business — essentially providers earned money
  when people needed care — but now policymakers are shifting to a value-based system.
  In a value-based system, keeping patients healthy will result in more earnings.
  \n\nPopulation health, care for chronic conditions, reducing hospital readmissions,
  and other methods of keeping people well are more important in a value-based care
  system than in a fee-for-service system. Digital health apps can enhance value-based
  care through things like appointment reminders, patient monitoring for those with
  chronic conditions, and various other functions that can improve the overall health
  of a given community or patient population. \n\nAre digital health apps consumer-facing,
  or used in a clinical setting? How are they improving patient outcomes? How are
  digital health apps integrated into clinicians’ workflows? \n\n## 11 Types of Digital
  Health Tools\n\nData firm IQVIA lists 11 specific categories of digital health tools
  in their report [The Growing Value of Digital Healthcare](: \n\n1. Consumer Mobile
  Apps\n2. Consumer Wearables\n3. Connected Biometric Sensors\n4. Smartphone Cameras\n5.
  Clinical Trial Patient Information Collection Tools\n6. In-Home Connected Virtual
  Assistants\n7. Telemedicine and Virtual Physician Visits\n8. Personal Health Records\n9.
  Web-based Interactive Programs\n10. Text Messaging or Email\n11. Health System Disease
  Management Apps\n\nIn the IQVIA definition, digital health is mHealth. \n\n> The
  term is used throughout this report as meaning the use of connected mobile devices
  — including, but not limited to, mobile phones, tablets, consumer wearables, connected
  biosensors, and in-home virtual assistants — to improve health.”  \n\nNo set definition
  has been settled on for mHealth, but many are quite similar. \n\n## What Defines
  mHealth? \n\nThere are a few [different definitions for mhealth](http://www.himss.org/definitions-mhealth)
  in use, but nearly all of them agree that mobile health includes a variety of apps
  and devices. Here’s a small selection of definitions for mHealth by various organizations:
  \ \n\n* Foundation of the National Institutes of Health (FNIH): “mHealth is ‘the
  delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices’” \n* The mHealth
  Alliance: “mHealth stands for mobile-based or mobile-enhance solutions that deliver
  health. The ubiquity of mobile devices in the developed or developing world presents
  the opportunity to improve health outcomes through the delivery of innovative medical
  and health services with information and communication technologies to the farthest
  reaches of the globe.” \n* WHO: “Mobile Health (mHealth) is an area of electronic
  health (eHealth) and it is the provision of health services and information via
  mobile technologies such as mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).”
  \n\n## Examples of companies innovating in the mHealth space\n\nThe Datica Platform
  serves as the compliance and data foundation for hundreds of customers developing
  breakthrough apps in the mHealth space. Here are just a few examples of our customers
  who are mHealth innovators.\n\n### CareMessage\n\n[CareMessage](https://datica.com/customer/caremessage/#spotlight)
  technology allows for automated appointment reminders for some of the most at-risk
  patient populations. The technology takes three critical factors into account: the
  patient’s precondition symptoms, their language preferences, and how they want to
  receive messages. \n\nAutomated appointment reminders for those who use the so-called
  safety net of the American healthcare system reduces the cost of missed appointments,
  improves patient/provider relationships, and improves health literacy. \n\n### Purple
  Binder\n\nDesigned to help hospital social workers find the resources their clients
  need, [Purple Binder](https://datica.com/customer/purple-binder/#spotlight) seeks
  to bridge the gap between social and economic services and healthcare services.
  They are currently working to build a messaging portal that will allow the hospitals
  and social services organizations connect when patients are referred. \n\n### healthfinch\n\nWhile
  many problems in the healthcare system involve patient services, some of them center
  around healthcare providers. For example, physician burnout is a huge problem, and
  one reason for it is ever-increasing burden of clerical work. [Healthfinch](https://datica.com/customer/healthfinch/)
  automates some of the mundane and repeatable tasks that physicians often sacrifice
  time that would otherwise be spent with patients to complete. "

  :summary: Digital health apps have been accompanied by plenty of hype, but a new
    report shows that the hype may be justified with $7 billion/year potential.
  :blog_lead: Digital health apps have been around for a few years, and have been
    accompanied by plenty of hype, but a new report shows that the hype may be justified
    — not because of innovation, but because such apps have the potential to save
    the US healthcare system as much as $7 billion annually.
  :post: "A recent [report from the data science firm IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/institute/reports/the-growing-value-of-digital-health)
    examines the impact of digital health apps on the healthcare industry. In the
    last two years — the time since the last report on the topic from IQVIA — there
    has been both an increase in the number of apps available, as well as in the amount
    of evidence supporting the benefits of their use. \n\nThe report includes some
    noteworthy statistics:\n\n* There are 318,000 health apps and 340 wearable devices
    available worldwide\n* Since 2015, 153,000 new apps have appeared in the Apple
    Store and Google Play\n* 200 new health apps are added each day\n* 40% of those
    new apps are related to health condition management/patient care\n* 55% use sensor
    data\n* 95% of all health apps have fewer than 5000 installs\n* 41 apps have more
    than 10 million downloads each, and account for nearly half of all health app
    downloads\n* 25% of physicians actively recommend digital health apps\n* 13% of
    physicians use remote patient monitoring technologies\n* 20% of large health systems
    are moving from digital health app pilot programs to full-scale rollouts\n\nEach
    one of those facts could be the topic of a blog post, but the report also addresses
    another interesting point: the fact that digital health apps can both provide
    improved patient outcomes and save the health system money. According to the report:
    \n\n> The use of Digital Health apps in just five patient populations where they
    have proven reductions in acute care utilization (diabetes prevention, diabetes,
    asthma, cardiac rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation) would save the U.S.
    healthcare system $7 billion per year and provide tangible outcomes improvements.\"
    \n\nIt is noteworthy that, in the statement above, the report is only discussing
    five specific patient populations — those that have been been investigated in
    random clinical trials (RCTs) extensively and been proven to reduce the use of
    acute care facilities. RCTs are considered the gold-standard in clinical investigations.
    \n\nOne of the most significant points included in the report is the fact that
    the number of studies investigating digital health apps, especially RCTs, has
    been accelerating. There were 571 such studies between 2007 and 2017, with 25%
    of them being published in 2017. \n\nThe evidence provided by scientific investigations
    is crucial because it demonstrates the [value of digital health apps](https://datica.com/blog/esther-dyson-q-and-a-on-digital-health-and-getting-to-the-end-game/).
    According to the report:\n\n> Value in healthcare can be defined as the health
    outcomes created for patients relative to the cost of generating those health
    outcomes, as well as the extent to which the ‘triple aim’ of improving the patient
    experience, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita costs
    of healthcare is delivered.”  \n\nThe digital health apps that are available for
    diabetes prevention, diabetes, [asthma](https://datica.com/customer/propeller/),
    cardiac rehabilitation, and pulmonary rehabilitation have been tested and shown
    to reduce the number of times patients must seek acute care. If they were adopted
    widely, the savings — $7 billion annually — would be significant. \n\nAlthough
    decisions within specific healthcare systems are generally made one app, or one
    category, at a time, policymakers consider the value of digital health apps in
    a more general way, such as the value to the overall health system. And, in the
    case of Congress, “value” often means cost-savings. \n\nThe report notes that
    policy initiatives related to technology adoption within the healthcare system
    are relatively rare, and when they do occur, the driver is usually evidence of
    significant cost savings. \n\n> Given the acceleration in clinical evidence development
    in recent years, persuasive cost savings arguments surrounding Digital Health
    apps may be within reach.” "

  :summary: Dr. Naomi Fried shared her ideas on the differences in innovation between
    pharma and hospitals, and opportunities for digital health vendors in pharma.
  :blog_lead: "Naomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare
    innovation and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most
    recently, as Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External
    Partnerships, she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients
    and healthcare professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation
    beyond the molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients
    and providers. \n\nIn our [July, 2017 podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/naomi-fried-how-digital-health-companies-can-help-pharma-innovate/)
    Travis Good, MD interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting in a lively chat about the differences
    between the way pharma and hospital systems innovate, as well as the advantages
    digital health vendors can tap when working with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways
    from the podcast. "
  :post: "\n> A whole world of opportunity exists for startups to bring new digital
    ideas into the market. Digital health vendors should be seeking out pharma for
    expertise and advice and working with providers to get to patient populations
    and to bring these new ideas forward to us. - Dr. Naomi Fried, Founder and CEO,
    [Health Innovation Strategies](http://www.healthinnovationstrategies.com/)\n\n##
    Pharma companies are slower to innovate than hospitals \n\nInnovation centers
    are prevalent throughout today’s healthcare ecosystem. But when innovation at
    Pharma companies is compared to innovation at hospitals and large health systems,
    hospitals cross the finish line first. “When it comes to testing and implementing
    patient-facing innovations, particularly new digital health tools, I think providers
    generally move more quickly,” says Fried. “They are closer to the patient, with
    fewer regulatory barriers to navigate around. So they tend to be more likely to
    jump in and try things. I’d say when it comes to [digital health innovation](https://datica.com/innovation/)
    for patients, hospitals are probably actually a bit ahead of pharma.”\n\n## Digital
    health vendors and pharma should partner\n\nInnovation in the pharmaceutical industry
    is fueled by both internal development and the external development taking place
    in digital health startups across the globe. The fastest path to innovation is
    in the partnerships being developed between the two. “Digital health companies
    usually have specialized domain knowledge,” Fried comments. “Tech-savvy, entrepreneurial
    startups tend to have a consumer bent and are better at developing user experiences
    and consumer-oriented solutions than large pharma companies.”\n\n> Digital health
    startups generally move more quickly and often develop products in months rather
    than years, and they can also make changes quickly and respond to feedback they
    get.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, pharma companies can help [digital health
    vendors](https://datica.com/dhsf/) get past some of the healthcare-specific hurdles
    to get their products to market faster. Fried explains, “Digital health startups
    can leverage and learn from pharma's well-established processes around healthcare
    industry-specific details. Those include things like CPT coding and thinking about
    payer reimbursement. They don't have to reinvent the wheel or invest heavily in
    developing regulatory expertise but really can look to a pharma partner who can
    help them leapfrog to where they are going.”\n\n“Where startups lack the infrastructure
    needed to reach customers and have trouble scaling up, this is something that
    pharmaceutical companies have done well. So I think that teaming up with pharmaceutical
    companies and tapping their extensive marketing infrastructures and distribution
    channels can really help digital startups get traction, much faster than they
    could if they were on their own.”\n\n## The three biggest opportunities for digital
    health products\n\nDr. Fried describes three areas within digital health patient
    care that improve value and have the potential to reduce costs.\n\n### 1. Medication
    adherence\n\nMedication adherence has a big effect on outcomes and is supported
    and driven by digital tools. “When patients are more compliant in taking their
    medications, the stakeholders — doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and payers
    — all benefit. I think medication adherence is one of the Holy Grails in healthcare.
    Getting patients to take their medications at the right time, with the right dosage
    for a condition can really save costs and improve patient outcomes,” explains
    Fried.\n\n### 2. Digital diagnosis and prediction\n\nA cost savings to the system
    and better outcomes for the patients make diagnosis and prediction technology
    a winning opportunity for digital health vendors to explore.  Fried explains by
    example, “Prophylactically taking medication that will avoid an asthma attack
    may mean a patient takes more drugs at a certain time. But the net result is a
    lower cost for the overall episode or even no episode at all, avoiding expenses
    like a trip to the emergency department.”\n\n### 3. Digiceuticals\n\nThese are
    digital therapies that treat a patient for a condition in addition to, or instead
    of, a traditional pharmaceutical solution. Fried says, “They can either be complementary
    to medication or they may even have the potential to substitute for medication.
    An example of a complementary digiceutical would be a pain management app that
    goes along with pain medication that a patient might take after surgery. This
    could result in the patient needing less medication or healing more quickly. An
    example of a substitute digiceutical is a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD). Kids could use these apps rather than taking a medication.”\n\n>
    I think digiceuticals will clearly drive improved outcomes and lower the cost
    of healthcare with digital health solutions that bring value in addition to medication.
    I think that the complementary and synergistic effects of digital health with
    medications are a net-win for patients, for pharma, and also for the payers.\n\nTune

  :summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as
    connected health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
  :blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is
    very often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica.com/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
    or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
    they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track
    an individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health
    is much more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality
    in today’s world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative
    strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day
    lives of people.
  :post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed
    Joe Kvedar, MD](https://datica.com/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President,
    Connected Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet
    of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/) which is packed with
    real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors
    drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been a proponent
    of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest HIT influencers
    in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems to be solved.
    Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable
    sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected health journey\nSome
    aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re only likely a
    few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health journey.
    Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1. **The
    future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
    is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
    prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
    offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
    is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
    it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
    already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr.
    Kvedar explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate
    that data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis
    will become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
    the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
    that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
    digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
    it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says.
    “The next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create
    a unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected
    health journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example,
    motivating them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting
    to happen today despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr.
    Kvedar says the business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance,
    United Health Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device.
    If they achieve three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that
    wearable device, they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome
    parts of the healthcare industry seem to embrace the connected health journey
    faster than others. “Companies like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking
    in wearables’ data and giving consumers something back in return. They are all
    seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of
    the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs and hospitals are used to
    making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't quite figured out
    how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward hospitals for
    keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges are happily
    being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability \nEven
    though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for consumers,
    there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area of interoperability.
    \ Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n \n- **Proprietary
    technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s financial best
    interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you are an IT vendor,
    almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom all the way down
    to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in and upsell you
    new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering
    their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep
    you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On the
    hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven by
    the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
    a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
    to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
    interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
    award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible
    way hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could
    conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government
    purchasers that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have
    a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump
    administration, but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world
    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and
    chronic illness management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing
    health technology devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic
    illnesses but also helping to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n-
    **Wearables provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't
    result in symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol,
    visceral fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't
    really, on a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context,
    you can think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables
    provide feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a
    Fitbit, for example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be
    motivated to walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always
    motivate a lifestyle change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation.
    “It turns out there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t
    care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
    person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback
    loop is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains.
    That could be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe
    continues, “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in
    the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is
    the Spire device that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory
    rate; it tells you whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe
    differently under different conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables
    market as data becomes more meaningful to people with insights rather than just
    numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians
    today are inundated with data, most of it today within the EHR. Clinicians spend
    too much time clicking, finding, charting, and checking boxes to document the
    in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard to imagine connected health
    data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy process. Dr. Kvedar suggests
    this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n \n1. **The current state:**
    Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr. Kvedar sees connected health
    in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We have quite a few examples of
    that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and a lot of our primary care
    practices are patient centers or medical homes as part of our population health
    management structure. In those practices, there is someone whose responsibility
    is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide that person
    with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that are either
    difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is not enough
    of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
    is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to
    get their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags
    the patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort
    through. Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something
    that really needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**
    \ Most industries today are already using intelligent analysis software and data
    science that creates meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data.
    Dr. Kvedar describes how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at
    the beginning of a new era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've
    been tracking their blood pressure for the last two months. We should be able
    to give you a dashboard view that shows what blood pressures are normal when they
    go up, why they go up. Do they go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do
    they go up after a meal? That would give you some real insight into how to care
    for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions that seeing this all become a reality
    with physicians is dependent on solving more than just the problems of data overload
    and dashboards. Here are two other important dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If
    you call it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds
    scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort
    of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration. Will that change? Not sure.
    Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by two years from now will be
    value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans are now doing this but
    the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason we did medical home
    across our system is because of value-based payments and it makes much more sense
    in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of AI.** “On the one hand,
    we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call it decision support,
    maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you
    are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how you frame it. And,
    of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that and how you convince
    docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going to get sued because
    there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right in the algorithm.”
    \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The pieces of connected
    health are here today, but we still have to put them together. Some of that will
    be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is even societal.”\n\nMake
