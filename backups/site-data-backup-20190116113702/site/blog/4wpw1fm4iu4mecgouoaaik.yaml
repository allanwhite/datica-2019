:summary: 'Results of a recent survey by the AHIMA shows that information governance
  is becoming a business imperative in healthcare organizations with benefits reaching
  to business intelligence and compliance.

'
:blog_lead: 'Every industry has its own jargon, but tech has more than jargon; it
  also has buzzwords. A recent buzzword-phrase in healthcare IT has been information
  governance. However, a recent survey and subsequent whitepaper by the American Health
  Information Management Association (AHIMA) shows that information governance is
  moving from buzzword to serious business imperative in healthcare organizations
  with benefits reaching to business intelligence and compliance.

'
:post: "\n## A Survey People Wanted To Take \n\nMore than 1,500 healthcare professionals
  responded to AHIMA’s survey, making it the largest survey response — by about 16%
  — AHIMA has ever gotten. Simply the fact so many people responded to the survey
  is evidence that more people have some understanding of information governance,
  according to [Kathy Downing](http://www.ahima.org/speakers/kadowning), director
  of practice excellence at AHIMA, and co-author of the white paper titled [“The Pulse
  on Information Governance in Healthcare.”](http://research.zarca.com/survey.aspx?k=RQsURPPsVSPsPsPsP&lang=0&data=)\n\n>
  Our thought is that more people have an understanding of information governance
  and so are more willing to click the button and take the survey,” Downing said in
  an interview with Datica. \n\nThe survey took place between July and August of 2017.
  It was web-based and targeted to management and staff in both provider and non-provider
  organizations. AHIMA lists eight important points that can be gleaned from the survey
  results, and the first is that people are beginning to see information governance
  as a critical business initiative. \n\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/5O26VkkrtKa6iKuSEGucKo/91678b45d2d4fb4f0643600e9f0e1076/Screen_Shot_2018-03-23_at_10.52.15_AM.png?w=1000\"
  alt=\"Information Governance\">\n  <figcaption>Copyright AHIMA, \"The Pulse on Information
  Governance in Healthcare\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n## Possible Parallels Between
  PM and IG\n\nHowever, that recognition doesn’t necessarily mean that organizations
  are taking action. Nearly 85% of the respondents said they were familiar with information
  governance, but 44% said no formal structure for information governance had been
  established within their organization. \n\nMany information governance programs
  are still in their infancy, and Downing noted that there will probably be some similarities
  between the adoption of information governance and the way project management came
  to be part of every healthcare organization. \n\nProject management wasn’t implemented
  as a whole organizational unit in many — if any — healthcare organizations. Instead,
  people did projects using the principles of project management, and over time the
  structure became ubiquitous throughout the industry. It’s entirely possible that
  information governance will follow a similar adoption process. \n\nDowning says
  that she is seeing organizations using current projects with the intent of making
  them part of their information governance program eventually. “As they have success
  with those projects, they’ll say, ‘Okay, that was an example of information governance,’”
  says Downing. \n\n## Compliance is high on the list of IG benefits \n\nThe respondents
  to the AHIMA survey answered questions regarding the functions or operations of
  information governance they expected to be most beneficial as well. Analytics, business
  intelligence, and informatics was the one most often identified as likely to be
  most beneficial, at 46%. Compliance was second with just over 21% choosing it as
  the most beneficial function of information governance. \n\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/nBr9JjijHa82888se8wsa/14c5ebbdf213517b2de28690a5dffddd/Screen_Shot_2018-03-23_at_10.51.35_AM.png?w=1000\"
  alt=\"Expected Benefits of Information Governance\">\n  <figcaption>Copyright AHIMA,
  \"The Pulse on Information Governance in Healthcare\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nDowning
  says that right now, people at different levels within organizations have varying
  levels of understanding about information governance — and the higher up, the more
  they realize the importance. \n\nSpeaking specifically of developers and programmers,
  Downing said she hopes they will begin to see that “information governance is about
  the creation, the maintenance, the use, and the storage of information over its
  entire life cycle.” She goes on to say that information governance is something
  that programmers and developers understand, but says the future of how information
  is handled is a concern. \n\n> We have concerns about the long-term information
  retention strategies.” \n\nDowning challenges IT developers to consider the full
  life-cycle of [compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/), including what
  the patient information contained in their products will look like in 20 or 21 years
  when it is the time to destroy it. \n\n\n"

  :summary: 'One thing is certain: healthcare still has a security problem. Out of
    295 breaches reported so far for 2017, 132 are hacking/IT incident breaches.'
  :blog_lead: "The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil
    Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information.
    The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the
    [HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html
    ). \n\nBecause entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report
    it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However,
    a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be
    instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent [penalties of GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)
    coming in May of 2018. "
  :post: "## HIPAA Security is still a problem\n\nOne thing is certain: healthcare
    [still has a security problem](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
    The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT
    incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
    2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg\"
    alt=\"2017 Data Breaches by Type\">\n\nOne of the largest, which occurred at Airway
    Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in
    a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and
    reported the breach to HHS in June. \n\nAccording to [a story about the Airway
    Oxygen breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier)
    in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed
    an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and
    applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed
    monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a
    cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.
    \n\nThe story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all
    of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s
    no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking. \n\n##
    Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers\n\nAnother interesting
    thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities
    reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered
    security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies,
    and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches
    as well. \n\nLate in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, [MongoDB databases
    fell victim to ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html)
    attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due
    to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice)
    that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special
    hacking tool.” \n\nMongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software,
    but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September
    2017, as many as 26,000 [databases were hijacked and held for ransom](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find).
    Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in
    the attacks, along with other entities. \n\n## Lessons from others’ mistakes\n\nOn
    December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st
    Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
    (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI)
    was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals. \n\nThe FBI found that
    the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server.
    As many as 2.2 million people were affected. \n\nThe settlement was for 21CO to
    pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to
    an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein & Lehr LLP,\nthe results
    of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into [what all healthcare
    entities should be doing](https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement):
    \n\n> The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate
    and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI);
    (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and
    vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement
    procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and,
    (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate
    without having written business associate agreement in place.” \n\nThe CAP that
    21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising
    security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements,
    among several other steps. \n\nSaul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr offer advice to other
    business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing, \n\n> As we begin
    2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy,
    Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance
    and make timely adjustments as appropriate.” \n\nAs we move through 2018 and toward
    May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves
    us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not
    only with HIPAA, but also [with GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/). After
    all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that
    amount in GDPR fines.\n\nLet Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for
    your digital health application with our HITRUST-certified healthcare platform.

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    <script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/08ebxufc4q.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_08ebxufc4q seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>

    </figure>

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

  :summary: Complying with HIPAA and proving it are two very different things. Datica
    is HIPAA compliant AND can prove it with our HITRUST CSF certification.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > “If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected.”   — [Dr. Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/), Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer, Datica

    Complying with [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can point you to the [documentation](https://hipaa.datica.com/) we’ve created to show how we comply with all the various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification, the only way to *[prove HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/)* is to go through [3rd party audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-auditing-and-logging/) as we have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance easier for our customers.
  :post: "\nUnlike many other technology companies who claim to be [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
    we have definitive validation and proof in the form of our [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/).
    HITRUST, for those that don’t know, is an industry-driven attempt to create a
    prescriptive, standardized, repeatable compliance framework that all organizations
    in healthcare can trust.\n\n\n## The 5 <strike>Simple</strike> Painful Steps to
    HITRUST CSF Certification\n\nWe went through our first [HITRUST CSF audit alongside
    Coalfire](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) — a 3rd party auditor — in 2015 and
    are now in the midst of our 2017 renewal audit. After going through this a few
    times now, we can summarize the HITRUST CSF Certification process with these five
    giant steps. It’s an involved process and there are no shortcuts. A company considering
    HITRUST Certification must traverse the same steps.\n\n### Step 1: Investigate
    the process\n\nThere are different ways to conduct an audit and the first undertaking
    is for the company to work with their auditor (for example, [Coalfire](https://www.coalfire.com/))
    to make a decision about which kind of audit to do. HITRUST CSF is fast becoming
    the standard, but many auditors have proprietary auditing processes that are also
    an option. When Datica went through this step, and in an effort to move from HIPAA
    to HITRUST CSF Certification, Datica executives and employees spent considerable
    time researching the domains of HITRUST.\n\n### Step 2: Scope the project with
    the chosen HITRUST CSF Assessor\n\nThis step is fairly straightforward involving
    the estimation of time and cost. In this part of the process, it’s determined
    how many and which of the 19 total HITRUST domains, dozens of controls, and 700+
    potential requirements apply to the company. Controls vary depending on the type
    of company and products being certified. For exmaple, a cloud platform like Datica
    has several hundred requirements that apply to us whereas a company that is not
    cloud based may have a completely different set of controls and requirements that
    apply to them. We have all the details about the domains, controls, and requirements
    that applied to Datica which we'll describe in a future [Acadmy article](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/).
    Subscribe to the right so you don’t miss that.\n\n### Step 3: Complete the CSF\n\nA
    sizeable amount of documentation is involved during the completion, including
    policies, risk assessments, as well as technical documentation and configurations.
    This can take 3-6 months the first year and around 2 months for subsequent audits.
    The amount of time this takes is highly dependent on the full scope of each company's
    audit determined in step 2. \n\n### Step 4: Validate the CSF with assessor \n\nThe
    company will need to provide evidence for entries in the CSF. This part of the
    process can take 4-5 weeks.\n\n### Step 5: Certify the CSF with HITRUST Alliance\n\nAlmost
    there! This is the lengthiest part of the process, with it taking up to 18 months
    for lawyers at the HITRUST Alliance to audit the audit involving back and forth
    on specific line items. Now that HITRUST CSF is becoming the standard way to conduct
    HIPAA compliance audits, the volume of requests going through HITRUST has increased
    from just hundreds in 2016 to thousands now in 2017. Once this step is complete,
    the company receives a HITRUST CSF certificate. \n\n## Rinse and Repeat\n\nThis
    whole process needs to be completed on an annual basis but the good news is it’s
    much faster, slightly easier,  and potentially [less expensive](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-cost-of-hitrust-csf-certification)
    the second time around. HITRUST isn’t easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience
    we’ve gained as a company and the extensive testing of our technology brings great
    value to our customers. The best news of all of this for Datica customers is that
    HITRUST allows for inheritance, which means if you are planning to obtain your
    own CSF certification, you can inherit Datica’s certificate to shortcut an average
    of 40% of the time and costs of the process.\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
