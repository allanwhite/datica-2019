:summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further down
  the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there is.
:blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
  by [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
  to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
  covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the subcontractor
  gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about who really is a
  business associate and who needs to sign a business associate agreement. \n"
:post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
  is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
  business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
  or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another business
  associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business associates
  handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
  information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI access, all business
  associates are required to sign what’s called a [business associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
  The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres to
  HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also typically
  defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type of data
  they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications (such
  as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose BAA
  do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule
  in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
  something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or hosting
  provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide additional
  services to the business associates, which are providing services for the covered
  entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain that follows
  the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered entity. The next
  link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors (also business
  associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors as business associates
  of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path of the chain. So, a covered
  entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business associates’ subcontractors,
  but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the chain is required by [regulation
  and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
  to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the covered
  entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is a hospital
  and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link (or business
  associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification in their
  BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and vendors
  who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken beliefs
  we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
  because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not storing
  PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection under
  HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because they
  encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial, but there
  is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything we
  do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/).
  At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
  physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
  As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
  to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because the
  vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered entity.
  As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system, you are also
  automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you subcontracted with
  will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state that covered entities
  MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their business associates,
  and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and so on, no matter how far
  “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may seem complicated, but don’t
  forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure that individuals’ health information
  remains protected by all parties involved."

    But is there an ideal version everyone should pursue?
  :blog_lead: |
    >   I wish I could, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight
    >   — _I wish I knew_
  :post: "Previously we talked about the importance of business associate agreements.
    But is there an ideal version everyone should pursue?\n\nGenerically, there isn't
    necessarily an ideal business associate agreement (BAA) because the contract depends
    heavily on the services procured. It's difficult to peg the perfect blanket BAA
    that is ideal for every company and every scenario.\n\nWe can, however, point
    to the ideal hosting business associate agreement. After three audits and numerous
    interactions with enterprise healthcare institutions, middle-sized companies,
    and startups, [we've published](https://policy.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa)
    what we believe is the best approach to a hosting BAA.\n\nVerbosity is always
    present in legalese, so we condensed the the keys to a good BAA down into 5 points.
    If possible, look for them in your future BAAs. Not having these in place will
    expose you to significant risk, incur additional costs, increase your time to
    market, or hamper your enterprise sales process.\n\n### 1. Responsibility for
    encryption (at rest or in transit)\n\nA core HIPAA mandate. Data at rest and in-transit
    *must* be encrypted. Ideally, your hosting provider should take care of this for
    you so that you are free to just focus on your application. This is [not often
    the case](http://bit.ly/1sHXvCb). Pay special attention to any in-transit caveats
    in the BAA. At Datica, we take care of all this for you.\n\n### 2. Breach notification
    timelines\n\nEnterprise healthcare is a general way to describe covered entities
    such as health systems, hospitals, health plans and insurance. You will discover
    their breach notification timelines are strict ranging from 24 hours to 7 days,
    which is constantly decreasing as breach penalties become more significant. Ensure
    that timelines across your vendors align. At Datica, our breach notification is
    4 hours after discovery of said breach. It's not uncommon for other hosting providers
    to range from 30-60 days.\n\n### 3. Logging (audit and more)\n\nLogging is [expensive](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/98877420250/receiving-your-first-splunk-bill),
    but a key requirement to ensure appropriate tracking of access and ongoing activity.
    With Datica, you get your own dedicated logging instance built from an ELK (Elastic
    Search, Logstash and Kibana) stack. You are free to utilize that instance for
    other purposes as well (such as app and db specific logging etc.). Every one of
    our current customers who have migrated over to us from other IaaS / hosting providers
    have been pleasantly surprised that we include this in our service. \n\n### 4.
    Backup and Disaster Recovery\n\nBackups are critical to avoiding PHI data loss.
    Most BAAs will outline it as your responsibility. We backup data on a regular
    schedule, so we take on the backup burden for you. Disaster Recovery (DR) is also
    important, but the exact requirement is slightly ambiguous. HIPAA just requires
    you to be able to re-instantiate your environment within whatever timeline your
    BAA sets. The advantage of the 12-factor approach we follow (similar to Heroku)
    is that it allows quick recovery of your environment and since the data is backed
    up on a regular basis, with Datica, you will be able to prove DR capabilities
    out of the box.\n\n### 5. Covered Services\n\nThis is primarily targeted at IaaS
    (infrastructure as a service) providers. AWS especially, provides a huge variety
    of services. Please pay attention to the services that fall under the BAA and
    the caveats that come with their use. Can the load balancer be used directly or
    are there caveats around SSL termination? Can you use the DBaaS solution? Are
    the VMs provided ephemeral in nature or is data persisted?\n\n### Summary: TL;DR\n\nPlease
    pay attention to the BAA. It is used as a mechanism to transfer responsibility
    and associated risk and liability. Look for specific caveats around covered services
    and encryption responsibilities. Logging especially can significantly increase
    costs. There is a difference between \"HIPAA ready\" and \"HIPAA compliant\".
    Look for more detail on this topic shortly from us. Catalyze provides an out-of-the-box
    solution to make your infrastructure HIPAA compliant.\n\n"

  :summary: HIPAA compliance isn't a sticker that you put on servers that wards off
    hackers and HHS. It's a dedication to doing the right thing for users and their
    PHI every day.
  :blog_lead: 'We have [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](/academy/business-associate-agreements)
    with all vendors that are partners to deliver our services which we pass through
    to our customers through our BAAs. It certainly simplifies things for our customers.

'
  :post: |-
    I was talking with a customer the other day about integrating with a service they used for real-time data processing. I first looked to see if this vendor would sign a BAA. I received this from their support staff:

    - The vendor in question doesn't necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant because they aren't storing data.
    - But, even if they did, they encrypted the data in transit and in storage.
    - Ergo, they are HIPAA-compliant.

    Parts of this are true, and it's good the vendor is encrypting data passing through their systems. However, a lot is left out.

    - There is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](/open-source/policies). At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA's physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#physical-safeguards-see-a-hrefhttpwww-hhs-govocrprivacyhipaaadministrativesecurityrulephyssafeguards-pdf164-310a). As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor to ensure legitimacy.
    - Even though the vendor claimed they were not storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection under HIPAA. Also, I would never take a vendor's word on this. You definitely want that promise in writing, in a BAA.
    - If you are going to work with a vendor who [transmits or stores PHI](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi), they've got to sign a BAA with you. Doesn't matter if they encrypt their data. Doesn't matter if they have printed policies that map to HIPAA rules. Doesn't matter if they are a big company that works with enterprises. Doesn't matter if they buy you dinner. Doesn't matter if they'll write a GUI in Visual Basic to scan for Angelina Jolie and Matthew Broderick. You will be on the hook in the event of an audit or breach and you will lack any avenue to seek legal recourse. That's the worst case scenario. HIPAA's rules and policies are exactly for that event.

    I'm always wary of companies that claim to be HIPAA-compliant that don't have clear BAAs or policies. HIPAA compliance isn't a sticker that you put on servers that wards off hackers and HHS. It's a dedication to doing the right thing for users and their PHI every day. There's no HIPAA police or mandated marketing policies, so there's nothing to stop companies from claiming HIPAA compliance by providing you zero or minimal reasonable safeguards of PHI. The bad news is that the moment you'd find out that you weren't covered under HIPAA, barring it didn't prevent a sale, would be at the worst possible moment of a breach or an audit. We can help you avoid this, and in addition to a BAA, you'll get superb service and ops support too.

  :summary: Simply put, a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) defines responsibility,

  :blog_lead: 'HIPAA guidelines define the safeguards for protected health information

  :post: "We've written about [BAAs before](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    Start there for a general understanding. The rest of this article, as well as
    a [Part 2 that talks about the top 5 things to look for in a business associate
    agreement](https://datica.com/blog/top-5-things-you-find-in-an-ideal-business-associate-agreement/),
    will dive into why selecting a BAA is important, and give guidance when doing
    so.\n\n## It's not just a checkbox\n\n>   A chain is only as strong as its weakest
    link.\n>   —  A wise engineer\n\nDatica has talked to many companies about their
    HIPAA compliant hosting requirements and how our Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
    can address their requirements. Our mission is to help them get most of the way
    down the road of [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Often we discuss the topic of other vendors in the space, both similar HIPAA-compliant
    platforms or traditional companies like AWS, Firehost, Bluebox, etc. While the
    conversion usually focuses on technology and features, we emphasize the differences
    in our business associate agreements as well, because, in some ways, it is our
    best feature. With Datica, you sign one BAA to cover the entire compliance spectrum.\n\nUnlike
    several others, we do not require a non-disclosure agreement (NDAs) to view our
    BAA. In fact, it's [publicly available](https://policy.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa)
    as a part of our [open-sourced policies](https://catalyzeio.github.io/policies);
    we often encourage newer companies to use the business associate agreement template
    as a starting point for their own BAA. We specifically set aside time with new
    customers to explain what it covers and what is doesn't and why.\n\nIt is very
    important you read the language in the BAA from your vendor and understand it
    well. While it might seem the thought \"I have a BAA with my vendor\" is sufficient,
    the reality is when a breach or any other kind of security incident happens, you're
    at risk for whatever was declared in your BAA. In many ways a BAA is a mechanism
    for transferring risk (and thus liability) from one entity to another by having
    each entity acknowledging their responsibility in managing specific aspects of
    the legal mandates. \n\n## Briefly, how a business associate agreement works\n\nBusiness
    associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new
    HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon the definition of _business
    associate_ to include something called subcontractors. _Subcontractors_ are typically
    service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business
    associates, which are providing services for the covered entities.\n\nThe effect
    has been increased chaining of responsibilities—a good thing in today's technology
    landscape. As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos,
    more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, [considered
    subcontractors](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
    These _subcontractors_ (e.g. Datica, AWS) sign BAAs with _business associates_
    (you), who in turn sign a BAA with _covered entities_ (health system, health plan).\n\nIt
    is critical for you to remember that ultimately you, as the business associate
    signing a contract with a covered entity, are the one left holding the ball. It
    is your responsibility to ensure the following:\n\n- **Know your BAAs.** Since
    a chain of entities (like IaaS / hosting providers, APIs and SaaS) touch the ePHI,
    each must have BAAs in place with you that are consistent and not contradictory.
    For example, a business associate selling to Hospital ABC can't agree to a 24-hour
    breach notification policy if the hosting provider has a physical breach notification
    policy of 2 months.\n- **Meet your responsibilities.** If all the hosting provider
    gives you is VMs and VPN access, you are now responsible for everything else HIPAA
    demands. We're talking about encryption at-rest or in-transit (even within your
    dedicated environment), dedicated logging, and so on. Know what HIPAA requires
    and what you're left having to take care of yourself!\n\n## The takeaway\n\nThat
    leaves you with an intriguing proposition. By choosing Datica, you only ever have
    to sign one BAA. Never will you have to worry about lining up consistency with
    multiple vendors, or dreading the anxiety of gaps not covered.\n\nIn our next
    article, we will take a look at the top things you should look for in a BAA. If
    you have any BAA questions, feel free to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com),

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

  :summary: The biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply
    the complexity of understanding everything. This new compliance self-assessment
    worksheet will help.
  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on
    the cloud. Sometimes it''s simple, like how long to retain PHI data for disaster
    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,
    like if the emergent serverless computing paradigm meets the requirements of global

  :post: |2

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###
    HIPAA Resources\n\n* [Understanding Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/)\n*
    [Datica HIPAA Mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)\n* [Learn the basics of HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/)\n*
    [Whis is HIPAA Important?](http://content.datica.com/why-is-hipaa-important )\n*

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
