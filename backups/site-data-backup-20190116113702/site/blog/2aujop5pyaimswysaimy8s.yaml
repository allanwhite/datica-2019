  As the CIO of MD Anderson, Mr. Belmont has many responsibilities, but currently one of the biggest is managing the new Epic install. In this interview, we talked about implementations such as this, important metrics for CIOs to track, and how to manage transformation and change.

  [Read the interview or watch the video recordings here.](https://catalyze.io/innovation/chris-belmont)

  This is our third interview. Previously we interviewed [Dr. Marc Chasin](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/marc-chasin-md/) with St. Luke's in Boise, ID. Dr. Chasin shared how to create a culture of innovation, and the challenges unique to rural systems. We also spoke with [Dr. Wayne Guerra](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/wayne-guerra-md-mba/), cofounder of iTriage. Dr. Guerra told the riveting origin story of iTriage, and gave tips on how to sell your startup into enterprise healthcare.

  We have many more interviews with some of healthcare's best innovators and leading CIOs lined up throughout 2015. More information about the series, as well as a phenomenal discussion with Dr. Molly Coye from UCLA health, will be published in March.
