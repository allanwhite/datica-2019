:summary: Cybersecurity is top of mind for most CEOs and so it was no surprise that
  it was a hot topic at this week's Health IT Summit in Boston.
:blog_lead: 'I attended and spoke at the [Healthcare Informatics Health IT Summit](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/page2/health-it-summit-series-calendar-events)
  this week in Boston, which started yesterday and ends today. The event was well
  organized and attended. The program was geared towards practical applications and
  lessons for healthcare technology. Health system and information exchange executives
  spoke at many of the sessions. '
:post: "## Security in the cloud\n \nIf there was a primary theme, it was cybersecurity.
  One of the two days of the event, and several extra sessions, were focused on cybersecurity.
  Given that cybersecurity is [top mind for most CIOs](http://www.himss.org/sites/himssorg/files/2016-cybersecurity-report.pdf),
  this makes a lot of sense. The other topics covered including digital health innovation
  and policy, with specific discussion of how policy is shaping health system initiatives,
  partnerships, and technology.\n \nBut ultimately, cybersecurity is the most important
  and most tangible discussion of the moment for health system administrators, and
  this conference demonstrated that fact.\n \nThe relationship between security and
  the cloud is an interesting one from our perspective. Historically, healthcare has
  been skeptical of the “cloud” because it has been deemed insecure. _Why would you
  trust your data in someone else’s data center when you can control your own servers?_
  A reasonable stance 10 years ago, but now that view is obsolete, and you can tell
  healthcare is shifting in its perception of security in the cloud.\n \nFirst, the
  sheer size of talented engineers focused on security at the top infrastructure providers
  is a commonsensical way to view security in the cloud. The largest cloud providers—Amazon,
  Microsoft, Google and IBM—have close to 10,000 active engineers focused on security
  and reliability of their platforms. Contrast this to the skeleton crew in most health
  systems managing a full stack of hardware and software, often using decades-old
  server technology.\n \nBut perhaps the most important reason that security is now
  better in the cloud than it is with old owned infrastructure is because of shared
  incentives. In short, the largest cloud providers are incentivized more than anyone
  else to be the most secure. If they were to have a single breach, their very multi-billion-dollar
  business models would be at risk. Contrast this to the incentives of an internal,
  stodgy IT staff at a hospital who have very different incentives.\n \nAll told,
  cybersecurity is one of the most important topics to healthcare administrators,
  and this conference’s focus on it showed that.\n \n## The Success of Digital Health\n
  \nMy talk was focused on strategies for digital health success.  We’ve spent a good
  chunk of time distilling down the 3,000+ conversations we’ve had with digital health
  innovators into a simple-to-use and actionable framework that we think the industry
  can use as both a roadmap as well as a spot check for gaps to scaling.\n \nThese
  digital health success strategies apply equally well to a small startup all the
  way up to an innovation group at a Fortune 100. This is the first time we’ve presented
  the framework and are thrilled with the positive feedback we’ve already gotten from
  attendees in Boston.\n \nWithin the coming weeks, we plan to publish the framework
  for anyone in healthcare to use and learn from. Feedback is always welcome and ideally,
  we will have others contribute to the framework. Given the sheer volume of content
  in it—which was clear as I put my talk together and presented—the key to its usefulness
  will be the interactive experience, which will be an iterative process as well.\n

  :summary: Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away
    but it's happening now as healthcare embraces SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :blog_lead: Something interesting has been happening in healthcare over the last
    several years. While we’ve been focused on meaningful use, EHRs, and Obamacare,
    healthcare has quietly started to [embrace the cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/).
    Most of us imagined the cloud onramp in healthcare to be many years away. But
    it hasn’t been. In many ways, it’s happened the same way it happened in other
    industries — through data connections between on-premise legacy systems and new
    cloud-based solutions. Just like many enterprises embraced the cloud over the
    last 15 years with Salesforce, so too are healthcare enterprises embracing new
    SaaS-based digital health solutions.
  :post: " \n## Data is in the Driver’s Seat\n \n**Healthcare’s onramp to the cloud
    is about data**, not about [lifting and shifting](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/feature/When-to-adopt-the-lift-and-shift-cloud-migration-model)
    legacy systems out of hospital data centers and into the cloud. And, the nature
    of the cloud enables a paradigm shift in the types of solutions that are succeeding.
    Digital health technologies, the major drivers of the future of health IT, are
    being selected *based on the best* of breed model, not *one size fits all* model
    of the [monolithic EHRs](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    that have proliferated and dominated health IT resources for the last fifteen
    years. This swing back to best of breed is important because it opens the door
    for new, highly-targeted and highly-valuable solutions to flourish. Healthcare
    is letting a thousand digital health flowers bloom. On the flip side, this new
    model also creates a ton of noise in the industry that champions and decision
    makers at healthcare enterprises have to wade through.\n \nDon’t get me wrong,
    there are still bottlenecks to the onramp, most notably data integration and,
    most frequently, a non-technical problem; but, even integration is becoming a
    solved problem (FHIR, new APIs, new knowledge transfer, and open source tools
    to educate and jumpstart integrations, etc). [EHR integration](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    is certainly easier to solve than setting up and managing a host of digital health
    applications on premise.\n \n## Beware of the Data Security Risks\n \nBut, this
    type of onramp to the cloud does create a new set of risks for healthcare organizations.
    **The data onramp, in many ways, is more risky than lift and shift.** The data
    being shipped to the cloud is health data and the stewards of that health data
    are [covered entities](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    (mostly health systems and insurance companies). This data isn’t contact information
    for sales prospects going into Salesforce. Privacy and security are always important
    but, in healthcare, there is a significant financial risk if you get them wrong.\n
    \nThe risk is compounded as healthcare organizations work with more and more cloud-based
    digital health solutions, as is now happening in the best of breed model that
    has emerged. The challenge in healthcare is that HIPAA is loosely defined at best,
    and loosely audited at worst. So a healthcare organization may work with ten different
    digital health solutions and all ten of those solutions may be on the same cloud
    provider, say AWS for this example, but every one of those digital health solutions
    addresses [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and
    data security in different ways. This makes it nearly impossible for healthcare
    organizations to maintain a consistent data governance posture and, maybe more
    importantly, to understand the their current risk of breach or security incident.\n
    \n## Cloud Cybersecurity Depends on Consistency\n \nSomething we often hear from
    healthcare organizations is that they have a mix of cloud-based solutions that
    are connected to their EHRs. These solutions can include applications built in
    house, applications built by development groups contracted by the organization,
    and SaaS applications developed and supported from 3rd party vendors. Chances
    are every one of those instances is secured and managed differently. At Datica,
    we run a fleet of 500+ cloud hosts across multiple data centers, running many
    different applications and technology stacks. All of those hosts and networks
    are audited and assessed on an ongoing basis. Trust us when we say that **doing
    cybersecurity in the cloud, consistently and continually, is non-trivial.** And
    it’s our [core expertise](https://datica.com/compliance/)!\n \nThese data risks
    are mitigated to some extent in the lift and shift model as the cloud is managed
    and configured in a standard way for technologies [migrating to the cloud](https://datica.com/blog/hybrid-cloud-is-now-the-preferred-option-within-healthcare/).
    But, that’s not the model we have in healthcare for the foreseeable future; lift
    and shift will happen, but our best guess is that is five to ten  years away for
    even progressive organizations. Ultimately, covered entities will bear the cost
    of data breaches and it is up to them to find a way to reduce that risk. The onramp
    to the cloud has already started and is has created new risks. Healthcare organizations
    need to get ahead of these risks as they continue to test and scale best of breed
    digital health solutions.\n \n"

  :summary: 'The buzz at HIMSS 2017: analytics, machine learning, AI, cyber-security,
    patient-centered care, and open data were a few themes we saw this year.'
  :blog_lead: "[HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/) is done. It’s time for
    the outpouring of commentaries on the event. And, amazingly, it’s already time
    to be thinking about next year if you’re an exhibitor. I realize the big companies
    do this but, at Datica, we too are planning and already booked our booth for next
    year. Thankfully we got a good booth space on the top floor and not in the basement
    (Vegas needs 2 levels to support HIMSS whereas Orlando only needs one massive
    level)."
  :post: "\n## Major Themes\n\nYou could have predicted these going into the event
    based on the sessions and promotional material.\n\n- **Analytics / machine learning
    / AI**. If I was to only pick one theme this year, this would be it. From Watson
    to Health Catalyst to the population health offerings of pretty much every EHR
    vendor, some form of analytics was woven into everything this year. Like patient
    engagement, a recurring HIMSS theme, [data analytics](https://datica.com/blog/3-benefits-of-accessible-big-data-analytics/)
    is seen as a major part of the future of care. Analytics does hold amazing potential
    but, like patient engagement, health systems need to develop strategies for how
    and where to use analytics if they are going to be successful. Analytics for analytics
    sake won’t help. Understanding the problems to solve or questions to answer with
    analytics is the key first step.\n- **Cybersecurity**. As more and more traditional
    health data goes digital, and more and more digital health data is generated by
    sensors and apps, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger topic. More health data flowing
    into more places means more financial risk of a [data breach](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    Cybersecurity is an essential part of digital health, just like cloud is an essential
    part of digital health. This should be a recurring theme of HIMSS as the next
    10 years are going to be defined by healthcare moving data between new technologies
    and between new partnerships.\n- **Patient-centered care**. This is the one I
    wasn’t sure if I should include because I feel like some variation of this has
    been a recurring theme. I guess being a constant theme still makes it a theme.
    The idea of [patient centricity](https://datica.com/blog/the-cmio-role-in-the-era-of-value-based-care/),
    maybe because it has been a constant theme, is starting to mature. Services need
    to be centered on patients, and many of those services will be technology driven.
    The reason for services need to be patient-centered is 1) that’s what patients
    expect today and 2) that is what providers, payors, and life sciences need to
    do to compete for patients, members, and customers. I think we’ve swung back from
    the days when we thought B2C, or going direct to consumer, would work across most
    patient populations. Groups like Healthgrades still own a lot of consumer health
    traffic but integrating those consumer tools with providers and more formal care
    is also a part of patient centricity. \n- **Open data**. This one definitely isn’t
    new. I remember hearing [Todd Park beating the drum about *data liberación*](http://healthstandards.com/blog/2015/06/23/data-liberacion/)
    back in 2011. It only took three more years for most EHR vendors to start to get
    behind a new standard called FHIR and another three or so years, until today,
    when EHRs are ready to expose data via FHIR. I’m bullish on FHIR as a potential
    data standard but highly skeptical of FHIR as a path to open data and innovation.
    We have projects like Argonaut driving towards new ways to use FHIR so we’ll have
    to wait and see how those develop. The overwhelming sentiment around open data
    is that access to data, ideally in a trusted and consistent bi-directional way,
    is the only way to build the technology ecosystem that’s needed to put patients
    at the center of care and start to drive towards the [triple aim].\n\n## Same
    same, but different\n\nThere’s a saying I first heard in Thailand and use from
    time to time - [*same same but different*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish).
    I think it pretty accurately describes my impression of HIMSS 2017.\n\nStepping
    back, looking at HIMSS as a whole, it felt like we had simply transported all
    the infrastructure and logistics from Vegas in 2016 to Orlando in 2017. It didn’t
    really feel too [much different from HIMSS 2015](https://datica.com/blog/himss-2015-recap/),
    for that matter. [HIStalkapalooza](https://datica.com/blog/visit-the-datica-vip-area-at-histalkapalooza-2017/)
    happened. The Athena party happened. Lots of bankers parties with better food
    and drink options. Uber didn’t work well. Restaurants were full all the time.
    Epic, Cerner, Athena and a few others still had the largest booths. Yeah, it felt
    like HIMSS.\n\nBut then, in other ways, it felt very different from previous years.
    The impression I got, on a consistent basis, is that people are burned out on
    the status quo. People are tired of HIMSS being the same year after year. People
    are tired of \"doing things to check boxes\", a reference to buying EHRs to get
    money from Meaningful Use, and \"want to really start making things happen\".
    These quotes are from people at large health systems, people in the same roles
    that would have said something like \"Epic is going to do that\" when asked about
    patient engagement or population health or pretty much anything health IT just
    a few years ago. These are decision makers at the core of the health IT industry
    and not just startups and investors. The tide has very clearly turned in the industry.\n\nThis
    is exciting! It will take time to see how quickly this sea change practically
    takes hold and we start to see more and more digital health technologies adopted
    and scaled at health systems. But, the process is starting and big systems are
    developing strategies and processes for the next 3-5 years. And, maybe the most
    shocking part, especially compared to several years ago, is that health systems
    are looking outside their EHR vendors for the future of health IT.\n\n*Want to
