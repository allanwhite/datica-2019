  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Healthâ€”The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,
    among others. His expertise on compliance, HIPAA, and health IT is highly regarded
    and sought after. He recently released his first book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). "

:blog_lead: With all the buzzwords in the healthcare industry, it has become impossible
  to keep track of their many interpretations and evolutions, but more importantly,
  tracking how to properly enable solutions. Clinically integrated networks have their
  many benefits. As regarded by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) they are permitted
  collaborations between otherwise competing providers (physicians and/or hospitals).
  These partnerships are organized in a manner that not only improves efficiencies
  in care delivery, including care quality and cost reduction, but also avoids any
  potential rival ramifications, such as competitor pricing fixes. Additionally, clinical
  integration enables providers to engage in contracted collaborations while evading
  the heavy scrutiny of the antitrust laws.
:post: |-
  Over the years, the notion of _clinical integration_ has evolved. The FTC in 1996 instituted a few guiding principles: 1) The framework must be based on the equal ownership of the substantial risk by the participant providers; 2) Clinical integration must produce an outcome that benefits consumers; 3) The goal is to provide supplemental services at a reduced price point, or that this would at least be an end result. Today, there are a few different features that underlie clinical integration:

  * Utilization of information technologies to establish relevant patient data exchange
  * Implementation and development of clinical protocols to minimize unpredictable variations in care
  * Evaluation of clinical results to confirm compliance with conventions that are furthering positive outcomes

  Previously, physicians handled the clinical affairs while healthcare administrators managed the finances and operations. Presently, those roles have blurred. Reimbursement now involves risk-sharing, which necessitates healthcare professionals work together directly to stipulate coordinated care. With such close working environments, some baselines must be met to fully enable the acceleration of clinical integration.

  ### 1. Party Transparency

  Each party must know how others are providing patient care. Transparency can truly be the catalyst to complete trust in a budding transformative partnership. Data must be exchanged, and all must work in tandem to ensure that data is an accurate clinical representation.

  ### 2. Aligned Commitment

  Developing a shared mission, vision, and values that each party can commit to will establish a process of inclusion for all involved.

  ### 3. Forthright Engagement

  Party engagement is critical, but must be based on mutual respect. Management needs to work with physicians at the start instead of strategizing independently and then attempting to assure physician buy-in.

  ### 4. Superior Support

  Only systems that support the above will be built to successfully deliver. Systems are necessary to cement any process changes into each party's daily activities. A properly enacted system helps maintain a collaborative culture of safety, quality, and reliability.
