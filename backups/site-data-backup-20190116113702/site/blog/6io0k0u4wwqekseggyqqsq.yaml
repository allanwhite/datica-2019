:summary: What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about patient engagement?
  Find out in the 3rd issue of “Mapping Digital Health” with Dr. John Moore of Twine
  Health.
:blog_lead: What does a breakdancing eye surgeon have to say about healthcare today?
  As the third in our [Mapping Digital Health](/blog/mapping-digital-health-an-interview-with-c-sats-co-founder-derek-streat/)
  series of interviews, we asked [Dr. John Moore](https://www.twinehealth.com/john-moore),
  CEO and Founder of Twine Health, about the status of patient engagement in healthcare.
  Moore’s entrepreneurial career had an unusual start when, as an undergrad at Boston
  University, he founded a breakdancing club. As he completed medical school and trained
  to become a specialized eye surgeon, he recognized a major break in communication
  between patients and their doctors once they left their doctor’s offices. Moore
  founded [Twine Health](https://www.twinehealth.com) in order to create technology
  that really reaches patients.
:post: |-
  > Not surprisingly, when people are put into the driver's seat in their care, supported by doctors, nurses, health coaches, and others, their outcomes dramatically improve and the satisfaction of all parties soars.”

  ## Q&A with Dr. John Moore

  ### What kind of impact is patient engagement making in healthcare?

  The term patient engagement has become quite diluted over the past decade such that, lately, it typically refers simply to sending out e-mail appointment reminders and surveys and getting patients to sign up for patient portals to get them to do what their clinicians say. In this respect, the impact is relatively slim. At the same time, there is a transformative approach growing that we prefer to call "health activation," which is incredibly exciting and is proving to have a larger impact every day. The likes of Omada Health, [Propeller Health](/customer/propeller/), [HealthLoop](/customer/healthloop/), Twine Health, and others are working on solutions to help people truly collaborate with their care teams and to become activated in their own health behavior change. Not surprisingly, when people are put into the driver's seat in their care, supported by doctors, nurses, health coaches, and others, their outcomes dramatically improve and the satisfaction of all parties soars. There is still a long way to go to scale this phenomenon, but this progress makes it an exciting time to be in healthcare.

  </figure>

  ### Is the "consumerization of patient care" making patient engagement easier? better?

  There is no doubt that freeing care from the shackles of our current fee-for-service insurance payment system makes empowering people to participate more deeply in their care easier and better. When doctors only get paid to see people in the office and hurry them through, there isn't much space for collaboration. A great example of the consumerization of care is the direct primary care movement in this county. Clinicians, especially in primary and preventative care, are fed up with the broken payment model and its unbearable administrative burden. And people are fed up with co-pays, deductibles, and terrible customer service. They are turning to direct primary care, a subscription-based model of primary care that brings the consumer directly to the clinician without insurance processes and other barriers. These practices get back to the basics of healthy therapeutic relationships and, by being unfettered from archaic payment models, they are free to adopt new workflows and technologies to further enhance the experience and to optimize health activation.

  In parallel with this consumerization effort, it is incredibly important to consider the world of workplace health that is paving the path ahead of consumerization and is about to boom. Self-insured employers, which make up more than 70% of those companies with greater than 500 employees, are tired of seeing rising healthcare cost by relying on the mainstream healthcare system. They are contracting with a new breed of healthcare providers that are building on-site primary care clinics and bringing health coaches to the office and to employee smart phones. While it might take consumers a while to start paying out of pocket for healthcare services, their employers are ready to pay the bill for them because this new breed of healthcare providers is proving that people love the convenience of their services and that they can dramatically decrease employer overall healthcare costs by improving prevention and chronic disease care.

  ### How important are the roles of advisors in building a digital health company?

  One of the biggest challenges in building a digital health company lies in finding the right product-market fit. Healthcare is incredibly complex, risk-averse, and sometimes perverse in its incentives in that healthcare pays providers for services, whether or not they help a patient’s outcomes. Having advisors that understand these complexities is incredibly valuable. They can help you to minimize missteps on your way to finding a product-market fit that makes your company successful while allowing you to maintain dedication to the patient experience and outcomes.

  :blog_lead: This second interview of our “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape”
    series, highlights the digital health innovation of Strata Health within the United
    States, and beyond. Operational in North America, the UK, France, and Australia,
    Strata Health is a privately held Canadian corporation of professionals with empathy
    for those who need care and intense respect for those who devote themselves to
    caring for others.
  :post: "_[Peter Smith](https://stratahealth.com/about-us/executive-team/), Executive
    Vice President Canada for Strata Health, shares his insights into digital health
    innovation across the globe. Working with healthcare practitioners, clinicians,
    IT specialists and administrators, [Strata Health](https://stratahealth.com/)
    pioneered the development of powerful software tools that have revolutionized
    patient flow, benefiting patients, caregivers and system efficiencies alike. Their
    proprietary intelligent referral technology has positive effects right through
    the care system from better matching of patients to specialists all the way to
    reducing paperwork._ \n\n## Q & A with Peter Smith\n\n### You operate in multiple
    countries with the U.S. being the most recent, whereas the typical digital health
    product is U.S.-centric. Do you see a big difference between the application or
    the success of digital health in the U.S. versus the rest of the world?\n\nBroadly
    speaking the application of digital health in the U.S. is more advanced than the
    rest of the world. This is due to the level of investment, the size of the population,
    and the amount of profit in the U.S. health market. There are also many other
    countries and innovation hotspots in the world but the U.S. generally attracts
    the most investment into digital health. But when you look at specific areas of
    digital health you can find examples where the U.S. lags behind the rest of the
    modern world. For example, using digital health tools and technology to improve
    the overall efficiency and cost of the health system is not that prevalent yet
    in the U.S. market. This is, at least in part, due to the fact that the U.S. market
    is for-profit private healthcare, which can create different incentives than you
    see in countries where the healthcare system is public. In countries with government
    paid (public) healthcare, those government bodies are driven to make the entire
    healthcare system as efficient as possible.\n\n### What's the biggest challenge
    holding back digital health innovation within the U.S. market?\n\nThere are many
    silos within the U.S. health market, and these silos most often operate as for-profit
    enterprises. This means each of these silos is looking to innovate when it makes
    economic sense for that silo, but not necessarily economic sense for the system,
    and not necessarily better care for the patient.\n\nThe U.S. is learning from
    the public health systems in the world. Examples are the creation of Accountable
    Care Organizations (which make providers jointly accountable for the health of
    their patients), and the concept of episode-based bundled payments (where providers
    are paid a fixed fee for a particular diagnosis or procedure, but no more if complications
    arise). The U.S. needs to review the interactions a patient makes with the various
    parts of the U.S. health system during a episodic journey, and then evaluate if
    the system is creating the right incentives for providers to perform in the best
    interest of the system and the patient, while still being a private enterprise.\n\n###
    Do you find the interest in digital health from C-suites to be the same in all
    the countries you operate in? Or different?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes there is
    equal interest in digital health from C-suites in Canada, U.S., U.K., Scotland,
    France, and Australia.\n\n### What’s Strata's greatest success story?\n\nThe health
    and social care teams across Cumbria are set to further roll out their Strata
    Health air traffic control system to manage patient transitions across the whole
    of the region. NHS Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust, University Hospitals
    of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, and Cumbria County Council have to date
    automated the process of health and social care referrals across the region, enabling
    transparent and consistent patient transitions supporting the patient journey
    while eradicating paper in the process. \n\n\n"

    the ongoing series called “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape,” highlighting
    the great work pursued by fellow digital health innovators.
  :post: "_Our first interview is with Seattle-based [C-SATS](https://www.csats.com),
    Inc., a venture-backed healthcare technology company on a mission to empower the
    nation’s 16 million healthcare workers and institutions to assess and improve
    their performance continuously, accurately and objectively._\n\n_Based on technology
    developed at the University of Washington by a team of surgeons, engineers and
    biostatisticians, C-SATS’ performance management system utilizes a unique combination
    of distributed experts and other reviewers available 24/7 from the Internet to
    assess healthcare professionals’ technical performance with accuracy equivalent
    to current gold standards…but at 80+% savings in cost and time to results._\n\n\n_We
    spoke with Derek Streat, C-SATS Co-founder and CEO._\n\n### When you think about
    digital health innovation for the healthcare industry and its institutions, what
    stage or part of the cycle are we in? \n\n<div class=\"person-card--vertical float-right-on-medium\">\n
    \   <img class=\"avatar circle\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2BF7cmdlRYYuOeguewIwUE/d88c8e111b8e4efedd7cee80666807a6/ZT4A0459-LinkedIn_72_dpi.jpg?f=face&fit=thumb&w=250&q=45\"
    alt=\"Derek Streat, Co-founder and CEO, C-SATS\">\n    <div class=\"person-card--caption\">\n
    \       <div class=\"person-name\">Derek Streat</div>\n        <div class=\"person-title\">Co-founder
    and CEO, C-SATS</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nWe’re still very early. Only within
    the last five years has the healthcare industry gotten around to thinking purposefully
    about patient experience. In most other industries, it’s standard operating procedure
    to surprise and delight your customers. We’re early with respect to technology
    enablement and platforms as well. The [electronic health records](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    and other systems that house the immense data generated about patients are still
    largely proprietary and closed. [Interoperability](https://datica.com/dhsf/#integration-understand-technology-landscape)
    is still a significant barrier to things like well-coordinated care, even within
    a single institution, because the systems are fundamentally built to stay closed
    and preserve legacy monopolies.  \n\n### Why doesn’t digital health innovation
    take hold faster in the healthcare industry?\n\nOne reason is the entrenched,
    closed-technology systems and infrastructure, making switching costs very high.
    A heightened sensitivity to privacy, security, compliance, and regulation erects
    barriers and costs as well. Health systems don’t just throw a new application
    in front of patients, and for good reason: the stakes are incredibly high. And
    if you're more risk averse, you’ll move slower. Finally, the economic models in
    healthcare are sufficiently broken that startups, often the source of scrappy
    innovation in other industries, have a harder time. That’s because those receiving
    value (patients) are disconnected from those who pay for it (think insurance).
    If it’s difficult to get paid for your product or service, and you’re a small
    startup, it’s tough to find the runway necessary to nurture true innovation.\n\n###
    Aside from the work of C-SATS, is there a digital health innovation you are most
    excited about?\n\nI’m most excited about the promise to bring [trust](http://www.csats.com/data-security/)
    to healthcare. I believe trust is the key because it leads to respect, understanding,
    and action among all stakeholders, from providers to health systems to patients.
    Trust will come through highly actionable insights derived from three areas: growing
    data sets, such as precision medicine; open systems to keep all parties informed
    of patient needs and care, for example, interoperable, cloud-based EMRs; and continuous
    monitoring and feedback loops to ensure excellent work, which is our business
    at C-SATS."

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
