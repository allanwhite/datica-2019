:summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of band
  authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is responding.
:blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
  kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
  attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from White
  House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent one
  announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
  more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
  ourselves.
:post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
  and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
  organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization is
  immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the widespread
  issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of Standards and
  Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update, specifically
  [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html), includes
  important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods versus a single
  source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
  is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
  and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
  makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity proofing\n
  \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates out identity
  authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and authentication
  proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have the proper credentials
  to access a file, server, or other data containing device or software,” explained
  Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole question is: How do we prove
  John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance is important to Datica customers
  who live and breathe in an environment awash with protected health information.
  More and more the healthcare industry is affected by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
  that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
  ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high price
  on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n \nThis
  clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because that will
  change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an organization,
  a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the victim’s accounts.\n
  \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n \nThe engineering team
  is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
  so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to disallow
  email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to the problem
  of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
  risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected health
  information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach to
  helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
  chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why Datica
  developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) platform
  initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become HITRUST
  CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security and compliance
  a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica at hello@datica.com

  Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

  :summary: As we roll into the end of 2017, it's worth looking back on how the industry
    has been doing protecting PHI against the threat of cyber-intrusions.
  :blog_lead: 'As we roll into the last few months of the year, it''s worth looking
    back on how the industry has been doing protecting PHI and adapting to the increasingly
    threatening world of cyber-intrusions. While the big stories generally revolve
    around the largest amount of lives impacted and the most technically harrowing
    attacks, it''s worth noting that there are still breaches as simple as someone
    stealing a laptop with a spreadsheets with thousands of persons worth of PHI on
    it. In this article, we''re going to go through some of the largest breaches of
    2017 and discuss how we address these as a company which we''ve shared in our
    open-source policies. While it''s impossible to say in retrospect if any breach
    was 100% preventable, having policies in place to provide "reasonable effort"
    to prevent exposure is key to minimizing the damage from the unpreventable. '
  :post: "## Ransomware or Malware\n\nAt top of mind in 2017 is ransomware and malware,
    which shut down and exposed multiple hospitals and HIT Vendors thoughout the year.
    Of those, two were notable:\n\n-  [Pacific Alliance Medical Center attack potentially
    leaks 260K patients](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/los-angeles-provider-breached-ransomware-attack-over-260000-patients-affected-updated)\n-
    \ [Nuance Impacted for Weeks Due to Malware](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cybersecurity/cyber-attack-update-nuance-still-down-researchers-believe-petya-not)\n\nThe
    vector of the attack is relatively straightforward: through phishing or infected
    3rd party hardware like a thumb drive, hackers gain access to hardware throughout
    an organization's network and encrypt data on that hardware. The purpose of ransomware
    is to extract payment to undo that encryption while other malware like the ones
    believed to be used in the Nuance attack are wholly irreversible and are just
    designed to effectively destroy the data.\n\nPreventing something like an attack
    like this actually hits to the heart of most of our policies, but let's go for
    the top 3 references in this article. First, [patch management](https://policy.datica.com/#9.5-patch-management-procedures)
    ensures that you are constantly being vigilant to new security concerns. While
    it's not directly stated in our policies, we have one person and a backup who
    are wholly responsible for managing patches for our system for security concerns.
    Second, having policies on [appropriate system access and by reducing the need
    for privledged users](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification)
    reduces the risk that if one user's credentials are compromised all systems could
    be accessible by an attacker. Third, we run [OSSEC and Anti-Virus](https://policy.datica.com/#17.4-prevention-of-malware-on-production-systems)
    on all production systems to identify any otherwise unknown attacks and to solve
    any issues brought up from an attack.\n\n## Unauthorized Access or Disclosure\n\n-
    [Indiana Medicaid warns patients of health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/indiana-medicaid-warns-patients-health-data-breach)\n-
    [Phishing attack at UC Davis leads to health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phishing-attack-uc-davis-health-breaches-data-15000-patients)\n\nOther
    than a vector for malware, [phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/)
    can also be used as a method for attackers to simply gain access to systems by
    getting credentials to a system. Or, a well-meaning dev may accidentally breach
    patient data by placing it on a public facing web page. \n\nWhile your mileage
    may vary, our policies have a few tips to help prevent this. First, we require
    [two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#17.7-production-system-security)
    on all production systems. While this doesn't necessarily prevent a system user
    from giving an attacker their credentials *and* auth token (sigh), it reduces
    the risk of unauthorized cross application access and minimizes the window by
    which an attacker can maintain access to an application. We also require access
    to all production systems to be [managed over a VPN with two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
    We also have an unofficial \"All data is potentially PHI\" policy for our managed
    integration services hardware/software. While we may have access to test environments
    with mock patient data, we assume that we may be sent PHI from any vendor or healthcare
    organization. As such, we protect all data like PHI as established in our policies.
    \n\n## Theft or Improper Disposal\n\n- [WSU hard drive theft potentially impacts
    1 million people](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/wsu-hard-drive-theft-potentially-impacts-1-million-people)\n-
    [State Employee Dumps Medicaid Worksheets in dumpster](http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/state-employee-dumps-medicaid-worksheets-in-dumpster/article_13f36eb4-1fb4-5278-93e1-1d30a00c9f9a.html)\n\nWhile
    hackers and ransomeware are increasingly perilous, [20% of data breaches reported
    to the OCR are good old fashioned theft and improper disposal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
    Someone stealing a laptop from a car or a unencrypted hard drive from an office
    to cause a breach are a tale as old as HIPAA itself.\n\nWe may be biased, but
    **stop storing PHI on local machines or on paper**. [We don't](https://policy.datica.com/#7.13-access-to-ephi).
    We only used [approved tools](https://policy.datica.com/#20.-approved-tools-policy)
    with appropriate access controls and encryption to store and transfer PHI. We
    also have [no servers in our offices](https://policy.datica.com/#10.-facility-access-policy)
    and BAAs with our cloud providers. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon't [learn about HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    the hard way, either getting beat up by your first 250-question audit or worse:
    by finding yourself on the OCR's Wall of Shame. Consult our policies or let us
    do the lifting for you on our thrice-audited, HITRUST-certified [compliant Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/).

    Jared Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus
    to fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory

    information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
    not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with
    the term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America
    Online (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked
    themselves as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and
    Ebay. These fraudulent emails would often persuade victims to open a link with
    a malevolent attachment or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing
    scams bred a more targeted type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
    For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
    if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
    someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
    subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
    Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches
    last year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
    report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
    hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches.
    Furthermore, spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting
    CEOs. From 2015 to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent.
    In the first part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health,
    Torrance Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according
    to Healthcare IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so
    far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
    This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
    With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
    spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
    Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica
    Security Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear
    phishing: high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for
    ransomware and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security
    walls when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what
    they want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization,
    is also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing
    attempt that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one
    of our executive’s email addresses. He or she used that email address to request
    a wire transfer from the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the
    department head alerted the appropriate person within Datica about the email and
    its request, and ultimately averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example
    to warn its own customers to such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance
    Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare organizations can better protect themselves
    from such attacks. Her recommendations and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n###
    Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll employees need to be made aware of what
    phishing is and the damage that can result from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines
    the steps he uses to fully inform Datica employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing
    email looks like, explaining how to evaluate such an email and then confirming
    that employees know to whom suspicious emails should be forwarded for evaluation
    are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions that could breach an organization’s
    thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic testing of employees’ knowledge
    and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting internal spear phishing lures
    that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions against doing testing
    at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular that on October
    1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals. \n\n###
    Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in place
    as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is trying
    to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should have
    the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
    Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then
    managing any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program
    “Having zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational
    goal,” says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation
    steps.” \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in
    HITRUST. Datica joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States
    to achieve [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)
    status and believes that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is
    the best way to protect its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity
    and compliance are deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).
    If you’ve ever had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment
    on the Datica platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of
    double verification. The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing
    department to quickly verify and make customer requested adjustments for access.
    Datica utilizes stringent measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers.
    These steps combined with the recommendations above better protect your organization
    for a spear phishing attack. \n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
