:post: "I like to ask people from health systems, most of them from the IT side, about
  their patient engagement or digital engagement strategy. It’s interesting to hear
  how systems think about digital engagement considering the buzz and hype it is getting
  from vendors and pundits.\n\nMy unscientific opinion is that very few systems have
  anything resembling a patient engagement strategy. Despite getting so much attention,
  most healthcare delivery organizations aren’t preparing for patient engagement.\n\nA
  typical conversation I have with somebody in an IT group goes a bit like this:\n\n**Me:**
  “How are you thinking about patient engagement tools and strategies, either in place
  today or planned for the future?”\n\n**Response:** “MyChart is our patient engagement
  tool.” (or some variation of that statement) \n\n**Me:** “Are you using other mobile
  apps or technologies to connect with patients for communication, education, or self
  management?”\n\n**Response:** “Well, there have been a couple of small initiatives.
  For the most part, we use MyChart.” \n\n**Me:** “How do patients use MyChart?”\n\nWe
  now live in such an Epic-centric world that Epic is synonymous with EHR and MyChart
  is synonymous with PHR. More surprisingly to me is that MyChart is also now synonymous
  with patient engagement.\n\nThe systems I’m talking to are larger systems, so it’s
  not surprising to see Epic. I’ve had similar conversations with non-Epic systems
  and those usually just conclude with, “We’ve tried a couple of things for patients,
  but nothing at scale.”\n\nMy sense is that the root of the problem with patient
  engagement has two parts. The first problem is the lack of definition around patient
  engagement. There have been efforts to *define and standardize patient engagement*,
  but I don’t know many systems that have adopted a framework around it. Lack of definition
  makes it hard to create and implement a strategy.\n\nThe second problem is that
  most systems, especially IT groups within those systems, are drowning in other projects
  such as EHR implementations. For health systems, patient engagement still has an
  unclear ROI. With limited resources (“our group is fully booked for the next 12
  to 18 months”), it’s hard to justify assigning labor and capital to projects that
  won’t deliver immediate value.\n\nI was telling a friend (and former Epic employee)
  about what I’ve been seeing with patient engagement, specifically MyChart. His response
  was, “Give them two years. When they see the timelines for some of the desired features,
  they’ll be out of the honeymoon phase and be looking for new ways to do things”.\n\nThat
  might be the case, but there are systems outside the honeymoon phase implementing
  Epic or other EHR. I’m curious what, if anything, those systems are doing with patient
  engagement.\n\nLacking definition and clear ROI, using the PHR solution of Epic
  or other EHR vendor for patient engagement makes sense. Looking at patient engagement
  broadly and defining it as people being more actively involved in their health and
  wellness, an EHR vendor won’t succeed in building a “one size fits all” solution.\n\nThis
  is not a knock against the EHR vendors or a reference to the intuitiveness (or lack
  thereof) of their products. I just don’t think one solution, built by any organization
  or developer, will ever have the flexibility and features needed to meet the hype
  of patient engagement. MyChart and other provider-based PHRs are a stopgap solution
  that have a lot of adoption because they are bundled with EHRs.\n\nWhere does that
  leave all of the developers and startups that are building technology to engage
  patients? One of the major challenges for them is overcoming the stopgap PHR objections
  from enterprises. They can certainly go directly to consumers, and many of them
  are. The data silos opening up are helping those engagement startups populate their
  apps without having to rely on manual entry. \n\nIt’s easier to get patients to
  adopt something when the provider and health system buy in. That’s why MyChart is
  the most popular PHR. But is MyChart what people want, or rather is it what people
  get?\n"

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
