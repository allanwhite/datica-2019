:blog_lead: 'In this second entry of our [Assessment Series](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hipaa-compliance-assessment/)
  we explore what a HIPAA Risk Assessment is and why it is crucial in ensuring the
  safe-handling of [protected health information (PHI)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
  with the growing dependency on information technology in the Healthcare Industry
  and the implementation of electronic medical records (EMR).

'
:post: "Back in February of 2009 the [HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic
  and Clinical Health)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/data-security-patient-engagement/)
  Act was passed as an element of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to fortify
  the privacy and safety of PHI by including provisions to the HIPAA Standards. Among
  the stipulations in HITECH was the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
  which has requirements organized into three classifications, and within each classification
  are 18 standards and 36 implementation specifications that are categorized as “Required”
  or “Addressable”. The **Required** specifications are crucial and necessities to
  be implemented; whereas, **Addressable** specifications are meant for scalable consideration
  based on individual and entity needs and best practices. \n\n## The Three Classifications
  \n\n## 1. Administrative Safeguards\nThese constitute more than half of the HIPAA
  Security Assessment requirements. As with all three standards, compliance will mandate
  an evaluation of the security controls in place already, a precise and in-depth
  analysis, and a succession of documented solutions derived from a multitude of factors
  unique to each covered body.\n\nThese safeguards are broken down as follows:\n\n###
  Standard: Security Management Process\nThe intent is to create the administrative
  processes and operations that a covered body will utilize to enact the security
  program in its environment.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Risk Analysis
  (Required)\n2. Risk Management (Required)\n3. Sanction Policy (Required)\n4. Information
  System Activity Review (Required)\n\n### Standard: Assigned Security Responsibility\nThe
  goal is to recognize who will hold responsibility for ensuring that the covered
  body abides by the HIPAA Security Rule. There are no implementation standards for
  this standard.\n\n### Standard: Workforce Security\nThe objective is to identify
  each workforce member that necessitates access to ePHI and their need, time of need,
  and how they are going to control access to the information. \n\n#### Implementation
  Specifications\n1. Authorization and/or Supervision (Addressable)\n2. Workforce
  Clearance Procedure (Addressable)\n3. Termination Procedures (Addressable)\n\n###
  Standard: Information Access Management\nMeant to restrict access to solely persons
  with a need for specified ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Isolating
  Health Care Clearinghouse Functions (Required)\n2. Access Authorization (Addressable)\n3.
  Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Security Awareness
  and Training\nTraining for all new and current members of the entity’s staff is
  mandated by the Security Rule.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Security
  Reminders (Addressable)\n2. Protection from Malicious Software (Addressable)\n3.
  Log-in Monitoring (Addressable)\n4. Password Monitoring (Addressable)\n\n### Standard:
  Security Incident Procedures\nImplemented to call attention to security occurrences
  within the covered body’s environment. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
  Response and Reporting\n\n### Standard: Contingency Plan\nNecessitates to plan and
  establish strategies for retrieving access to ePHI if an entity where to experience
  a crisis or occurrence that disrupts urgent business operations.\n\n#### Implementation
  Specifications\n1. Data Backup Plan (Required)\n2. Disaster Recovery Plan (Required)\n3.
  Emergency Mode Operation Plan (Required)\n4. Testing and Revision Procedures (Addressable)\n5.
  Applications and Data Criticality Analysis (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Evaluation\nRequires
  entities to create a process to review and maintain standard security measures to
  comply with The Security Rule. There are no implementation specifications for this
  standard.\n\n### Standard: Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements\nStates
  that covered bodies are required to sign a contract or other agreement that meet
  the definition of a “business associate.” This standard has no implementation specifications.\n\n##
  2. Physical Safeguards\nThese safeguards are meant to evaluate and implement all
  physical access to ePHI.\n\nThese are broken down as follows within a HIPAA Security
  Assessment:\n\n### Standard: Facility Access Controls\nEnacted to limit the access
  to the electronic information systems where ePHI is housed.\n\n#### Implementation
  Specifications\n1. Contingency Operations (Addressable)\n2. Facility Security Plan
  (Addressable)\n3. Access Control and Validation Procedures (Addressable)\n4. Maintenance
  Records (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Workstation Use\nRequires that entities clarify
  the proper uses to be done by electronic computing devices. There are no implementation
  specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Workstation Security\nAddresses
  the operations and procedures for how workstations should be utilized and secured
  from unauthorized persons. There are no implementation specifications for this standard.
  \n\n### Standard: Device and Media Controls\nThis covers the correct handling of
  electronic media including removal, receipt, backup, storage, reuse, disposal, and
  responsibility. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Disposal (Required)\n2.
  Media Re-Use (Required)\n3. Accountability (Addressable)\n4. Data Backup and Storage
  (Addressable)\n\n## 3. Technical Safeguards\nA covered body is mandated to determine
  the security protocol and specified technologies that are appropriate for implementing
  in its organization while complying with these safeguards which are broken down
  according to the HIPAA Security Assessment as follows:\n\n### Standard: Access Control\nRequired
  to provide/restrict persons with the access necessary for the information systems,
  applications, programs, or files associated with ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
  Unique User Identification (Required)\n2. Emergency Access Procedure (Required)\n3.
  Automatic Logoff (Addressable)\n4. Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)\n\n###
  Standard: Audit Controls\nThis standard is meant to be useful for the records and
  examinations of information system activity, particularly in a security violation.This
  standard has no implementation specifications.\n\n### Standard: Integrity\nThis
  standard requires that policies and processes are implemented to protect ePHI from
  being altered or destroyed.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Mechanism
  to Authenticate Electronic Protected Health Information(Addressable)\n\n### Standard:
  Person or Entity Authentication\nThis standard confirms that a person is who they
  are claiming to be before being granted the access to ePHI. This standard has no
  implementation specifications.\n\n### Standard: Transmission Security\nThis standard
  is utilized to guard against those who are not granted permissions to ePHI that
  is being communicated over electronic means.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
  Integrity Controls (Addressable)\n2. Encryption (Addressable)\n\nIn summary, when
  doing your own HIPAA Security Assessment, keep in mind that this applies to all
  media types including oral, paper, and electronic while simultaneously considering
  integrity, confidentiality, and availability. There are many HIPAA Security Assessment
  tools and services that have been released but no one is more highly regarded in
  this space than Datica as a [HIPAA compliance authority](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).

  :summary: The biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply
    the complexity of understanding everything. This new compliance self-assessment
    worksheet will help.
  :blog_lead: 'We are asked daily questions around what it takes to be compliant on
    the cloud. Sometimes it''s simple, like how long to retain PHI data for disaster
    recovery (answer: it depends, but probably 90 days). Sometimes it''s complex,
    like if the emergent serverless computing paradigm meets the requirements of global
    compliance regimes (answer: it depends, but pull up a chair).'
  :post: |2

    Consistently, the biggest barrier to a successful cloud compliance program is simply the complexity of understanding everything. This is really hard! But not because it's hard to understand, only hard to absorb all the information.

    In order to help those assessing their own compliance posture on a public cloud like [AWS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM, we crafted a [lightweight self assessment](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment). We say lightweight because by no means is it a comprehensive risk assessment tool—you should stick to something like a self assessment with the [HITRUST CSF v9.1](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/). Instead, it is purposefully designed to condense all the controls into an easy to understand list. Brevity was the focus but in the Datica way of transparent content and helpful guidance. You can download it free today.

    ## The assessment is pretty straightforward:

    * It is cut up into the three broadest layers of cloud technology with which we can advise—the physical layer, the operating system layer, and the administrative layer. Consider these the main layers to think about abstracted cloud services.
    * Within the layers, we itemized general considerations, like network encryption or access control lists. The items are somewhere between the granularity of an official risk management framework and an understated bulleted list. Broad enough to not cause your eyes to bleed from the legalese, but concise enough to accurately describe the consideration.
    * Along with the item we offer a quick binary assessment, to which a simple Yes or No answer will guide you to understanding if you have more research to do.

    For those who are not experts, and are trying to wrap their head around what it takes to be compliant on the cloud, will find the tool useful. Let us know what you think!

    providers like [Datica](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/), are mandated to conduct a HIPAA
    risk assessment as the first step toward integrating preventatives stipulated

    by The Department of Health and Human Services, and ultimately attaining true
    HIPAA compliance.

'
  :post: "### So what does a HIPAA Risk Assessment require?\n\nThe Department of Health
    and Human Services has defined nine necessary constituents of a HIPAA risk assessment
    that all healthcare and healthcare-related organizations that store or share ePHI
    must include in their assessment document:\n\n1. Assessment Scope - Inclusive
    of any and all potential risks and susceptibilities to the privacy, procurability,
    and morality of ePHI. Organizations should be inclusive of electronic media that
    is utilized such as portable devices, networks, and desktops. If there are multiple
    sites, it is important to include the network security between them in the scope;
    this includes your hosting terms with third-parties or business associates.\n\n2.
    Data Reserve - Where is the data being stored, collected, conserved or transmitted?
    \n\n3. Specify and Record Latent Risks and Susceptibilities - Predicting future
    HIPAA violations can really help your organization rapidly and effectively find
    a resolution.\n\n4. Evaluate Existing Security Measures - This will include any
    encryption, two-factor authentication, and all other security methods that your
    HIPAA hosting provider has put in effect.\n \n5. Evaluate the Feasibility of a
    Risk Occurring - In association with #3, this will accurately estimate the possibility
    of an ePHI breach.\n\n6. Evaluate the Impact a Risk Occurrence Could Have - Assess
    how many people could be affected and the level of PHI that could be exposed,
    inclusive of health information and billing information. \n\n7. Assess the Level
    of Risk - The Department of Human and Health Services recommends taking #5 and
    #6 to establish the level of risk. When documenting these risk levels, accompany
    with them a list of actions that would be performed in a mitigative response.\n\n8.
    Prepare Documentation - There are no parameters around documentation formatting
    but the assessment must be in writing.\n\n9. Regular Reviews and Updates to HIPAA
    Risk Assessment - It is crucial that the assessment is ever ongoing. It is recommended
    that a new assessment is taken whenever new processes, technologies, or operations
    are introduced into an organization. \n\nCurious how we at Datica do our HIPAA
    Risk Assessment? \n\nCheck out our [Datica HIPAA Docs](https://hipaa.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-compliance)

    federally required measures is becoming more difficult in healthcare. Enterprise
    executive liability stipulates an ongoing effort for assessment to create a first-class
    compliance strategy. In the most minimum context, HIPAA has created complexities
    to the health insurance systemization that was already inundated with federal
    mandates. For example:\n\n* All departments and serviceable groups that deal with
    PHI will be observed with scrutiny for HIPAA compliance.\n* Policies in relation
    to HIPAA compliance must be written and documented, but employees are required
    to be trained on them whilst also having an expounded privacy officer accountable
    for managing the enterprise's HIPAA compliance.\n* Noncompliance penalties have
    not been fully systematized but risk of press coverage and detrimental consumer
    perceptions cannot be overlooked. \n\nThe required HIPAA Compliance Assessment
    is intentioned to be brief, concise, and extensive. A complete assessment will
    include these measures:\n\n* Recognize state of readiness for all facets of HIPAA
    - privacy, security, and transactional\n* Ascertain areas of preeminent risk\n*
    Facilitate ongoing regulatory compliance\n* Offer insights into efficiency and

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
