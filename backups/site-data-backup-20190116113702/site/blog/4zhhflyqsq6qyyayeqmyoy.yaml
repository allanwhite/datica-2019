:post: "If you haven’t heard of [Zipnosis, Inc.](https://zipnosis.com/) yet, you’re
  missing out on some of the latest, greatest, and most convenient innovations to
  modern mainstream medicine. Here at Datica, not only do we love their services,
  but we love their business partnership. Zipnosis turned to Datica when searching
  for a HIPAA compliant technology partner to handle their hosting, and then later
  on, all of their [HL7 integration](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/)
  necessities. Want to know why? Read all about it in our [Zipnosis Case Study](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/zipnosis/).
  \n\nNot only did Datica save Zipnosis 150+ man hours — a savings that continually
  grows with each and every integration incorporated — but along the way, realized
  we shared the same vision about the next generation of network integration. And
  with such a flourishing relationship, Datica will be right there every step of the
  way as Zipnosis scales its business, while still providing the highest level of
  professional expertise and services as both colleagues and friends. \n\nYou could
  say that Zipnosis and Datica are a match made in HL7 Heaven, but read for yourself
