  \n\nDatica’s 2018 spring innovation report examines how the media is describing
  the digital health transformation through four articles from major industry publications.
  The report also examines insights from Accenture and the World Economic Forum surveys,
  and takes a look at HIMSS 2018. "
:post: "## Surprising digital health trends reported by the media\n\nFeaturing stories
  from The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Harvard Business Review, and Healthtech
  News, Datica’s Spring 2018 innovation report finds that there are some specific,
  and perhaps surprising trends in digital innovation. From hospitals supporting startups
  to the competition for data that artificial intelligence is bringing about, the
  four articles touch on current hot button topics. \n\nIn a story titled [“Hospitals
  Fund Potential Game-Changers in Health Tech”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-vie-to-fund-a-health-tech-breakthrough-1520430189)
  the Wall Street Journal reports on how some hospitals are beginning to fund health-tech
  startups in the hopes of supporting innovation that will result in improvements.
  Hospitals are in a good position to decide which innovative projects to support
  because hospitals have the clearest understanding of their own problems that need
  to be solved. \n\nThe Economist tackles the topic of medical data and technologies
  surrounding it in an article titled [“Data and medicine: A revolution in healthcare
  is coming.”](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming)
  Applications that detect heart arrhythmia or that have diagnostics capabilities
  are powerful, as are those that may improve the management of chronic disease. However,
  the article misses the mark in its implication that those types of technologies
  are on the verge of widespread adoption. Such innovations will change healthcare,
  but it will happen gradually. \n\nPatient-centered is a phrase that appears in almost
  every discussion of digital health innovation, and the Harvard Business Review examines
  the importance of keeping the patient front and center in an article titled [“Putting
  Humans at the Center of Health Care Innovation.”](https://hbr.org/2018/03/putting-humans-at-the-center-of-health-care-innovation)
  Innovation is most important when it puts people, rather than money, at the center.
  \n\nAdvancing innovation in digital health is going to require a migration to the
  cloud, according to an article in Healthtech News titled [“Eric Schmidt lays out
  formula for healthcare innovation.”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/eric-schmidt-lays-out-formula-healthcare-innovation)
  Moving to the cloud will mean having an infrastructure that is tested, interoperable,
  and secure. However, AI is going to require data acquisition because it depends
  on large datasets to determine algorithmic success. \n\n## Reports from the Experts\n\nReports
  from institutions, academic organizations, and consulting firms often contain insights
  that aren’t always obvious from interactions with partners and customers. The Datica
  spring innovation report includes summaries from two such reports: the [Accenture
  Digital Health Technology Vision 2017](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-digital-health-tech-vision-2017)
  and the [World Economic Forum report.](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/healthcare-building-a-digital-healthcare-system/)
  \n\nEach of the reports points to trends that are going to impact the digital health
  transformation. AI, digital ecosystems, open marketplaces for talent, the need for
  better understanding human behavior, and entirely new digital industries are all
  mentioned in the Accenture report. The World Economic Forum included discussion
  of how to build a digital healthcare system that will empower people. \n\n## Heavyweights
  at HIMSS18\n\nMicrosoft has always been involved in [HIMSS](https://datica.com/blog/himss18-recap-invasion-major-tech-providers/),
  but this year their focus was less on Azure and more on the Microsoft solutions
  on the cloud. AWS had a bigger presence than ever before at HIMSS, and featured
  demonstrations of solutions to specific healthcare problems. \n\nGoogle put on a
  show bigger than either Microsoft or AWS, with a major booth and high profile sessions
  and keynotes. However, it wasn’t clear exactly what cloud-based solutions Google
  is offering the healthcare sector. \n\nTelehealth and population health have matured.
  They are no longer coming soon but have arrived. Both technologies are now part
  of the health IT landscape. \n\nIT was also clear at HIMSS18 that there’s more innovation
  happening than necessarily meets the eye. New projects in digital health products
  as well as internal innovation within organizations are likely to spur rapid improvements
  in the near future. \n\nThe full [Datica Spring 2018 innovation report](https://datica.com/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
  elucidates the sources currently driving the digital health transformation. By pulling
  together unique perspectives on disparate topics, Datica clearly describes the innovation
  situation and how it’s impacting digital health. \t\t\t\t\t\n"

    of shadow IT in healthcare. Is it a security threat or enabler for innovation? '
  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica.com/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica.com/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica.com/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica.com/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

    on public vs. private cloud computing within healthcare.
  :blog_lead: 'Last quarter, we published our first industry report titled [The Heart
    of Medicine: Transformation Through Technology](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/).
    The report took a look at how sentiments have changed the last few years around
    the topic of "cloud" within enterprise healthcare. Measuring the changes between
    a 2014 HIMSS study and their 2017 version showed that certain use cases on the
    cloud have not just taken off, but are commonplace—a good sign for the progress
    of digital health.'
  :post: |-
    Each quarter we will bring a similar report focused on a key topic related to healthcare technology. The shape of a report can take many forms. One quarter might be an extensive data study while another quarter might be an aggregation of industry views. Regardless of the style of report, the intent remains the same: Inform the digital health market with insights that can help them be successful. _There is no strategy without intelligence._

    Today we are happy to share our latest report titled [Public and Private Cloud Computing within Healthcare](https://datica.com/innovation/public-vs-private-cloud-computing-within-healthcare-summer-2017/). The premise of this report is simple: the debate between Public vs. Private cloud models is ongoing, yet many digital health companies we speak with aren't exactly sure their definitions, nor which model might be a fit for them. The [cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) is expansive and complex. This report is meant to help breakdown the differences between the two, and source industry insights related to what is a good fit for healthcare.

    Feedback is always welcome. Let us know what you think on Twitter at @daticahealth!

  :post: "<img alt=\"himss-2018-logo\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/BejYKjLiuWuE0iEK6WQIM/521488e52b97804bab49f7dd0a1994e2/himss-2018-logo.png?w=240\"
    width=\"120\" class=\"float-left-on-medium\" />\n\nHIMSS 2018 saw the presence
    of three of the largest tech companies in the world flex their muscles. The event
    itself is evidence that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.\n\n##
    The 3 largest tech companies flex their muscles at HIMSS\n\n### Microsoft showcased
    Azure at HIMSS\n\nDue to their rich health IT history, Microsoft has engaged with
    HIMSS in the past, but the company’s positioning in 2018 is noteworthy. A through
    line across its booth facilities, its engagements, and in 1:1 conversations was
    a focus on modernizing health IT via intelligent solutions. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) certainly had a presence, but it was grounded in usable tools like Office
    365 and Microsoft Teams. Any cloud reference had less to do with Azure itself
    and more to do with Microsoft solutions on the cloud. \n\n### AWS went big HIMSS\n\nFor
    the first time in its history, AWS went big with an impressive HIMSS booth. This
    major physical presence is the only major one in healthcare outside of their own
    re:Invent conference. AWS had a mix of solution architecture Q&A, presentations
    from its broad partner ecosystem, and demonstrations of healthcare-specific cloud
    solutions available on AWS. Its 2018 presence showed AWS cares about being active
    in health IT and [AWS has a strong story to tell](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-on-aws-is-possible-find-out-how-at-himss18/)
    with both new digital health companies and enterprise health IT. \n\n### Google
    went all out at HIMSS\n\nBut then we have Google. It also spent big — much bigger
    than Microsoft or AWS. Google had a major booth, but also several keynotes and
    high profile sessions that all must have cost enormous amounts in sponsorships.
    Of the three, it’s easy to see through total spend and coverage that Google is
    making the biggest bet that its cloud offerings can help healthcare. The only
    problem is understanding the actionable theme Google had in mind. Is it looking
    to help hospitals migrate old systems to Google’s cloud? Is it trying to get AI
    adopted in enterprises? The most consistent message centered on helping smaller
    startups succeed, which is then curious why Google would spend so much money getting
    in front of hospital CIOs. \n\nThe aggregate observation is big tech is looking
    to spend big dollars to land a big presence with this big event. All are here
    to stay this time. \n\n## Healthcare innovation was everywhere at HIMSS18\n\n###
    Certain innovations are now mature \n\nFrom the presence of the booths, the coverage
    within sessions, and the chatter amongst attendees, two major areas of innovation
    have finally made it: telehealth and population health. \nThose who follow healthcare
    know these two areas aren’t new, per se. But that’s not the point. The key observation
    from HIMSS18 is that, in the aggregate, all companies have “made it.” Their spend
    was enormous, their booths packed, their messages grand, and their sessions well
    attended. For upwards of a decade, we’ve talked about the eventuality of both
    telehealth and population health. Well, HIMSS18 proved to us that the companies
    that figured out the models have finally crested the mountain in that long journey,
    and are now part of the health IT regulars. \n\n### The startups are mostly focused
    on AI \n\nMost early-stage companies were predominantly downstairs in the startup
    hub, but some were upstairs as well. Regardless of the location, a clear and obvious
    trend prevailed: Artificial Intelligence. AI is coming to healthcare. When it
    arrives, we aren’t certain. Much like telehealth, its timing will likely be tied
    to payment structures and when healthcare systems are allowed to receive reimbursement
    for its use. But the sheer volume of AI-focused business, products, and tools
    staggered attendees and it felt inevitable that AI will disrupt healthcare in
    some capacity. Our guess is that many net-new products will be deployed over the
    next two years, will show demonstrative impact, and then after that a larger watershed,
    will happen similarly to what we saw with telehealth and population health. \n\n###
    Net-new innovation is more popular on the cloud than migrating old systems \n\nLastly,
    we saw the [healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) as
    a mixed bag at HIMSS18. Conversation after conversation indicated a resistance
    to migrating old systems to the cloud. Ultimately, CIOs aren’t interested in the
    downside — higher hidden costs than the cloud vendor space indicates, high probability
    of downtime or failure of fragile systems during migration, and general unease
    with understanding risks and liabilities yet on the cloud. \n\nDatica ran a CHIME
    focus group with 18 hospital and health system CIOs. Across the board, their sentiment
    remained the same. Migration of existing systems just isn’t a priority. \nOn the
    flip side, much innovation is happening with new projects. These innovations can
    either be in the form of digital health products CIOs are purchasing, or as internal
    projects led by innovation groups. The cloud is not universally bad in the eyes
    of hospital CIOs. In fact, all 18 voiced the priority of cloud-first innovations
    when evaluating new tools or solutions. \nThis dichotomy became one of the more
    interesting observations from HIMSS18. You might also want to take a look at the
    thorough recap and analysis of that [CHIME focus group here](https://datica.com/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).\n\n###
    More internal innovation is happening than many realize \n\nOne interesting thread
    throughout the entire conference hinged on the consistency of internal innovation
    being a focus. More conversations led to CIOs or innovation directors looking
    to internal resources for solving a specific problem at their system as opposed
    to buying a new product. \n\nIt’s not just centered with innovation groups, either.
    We were shocked to hear stories of how some institutions are completely rethinking
    innovation from the ground up, giving smaller teams more democracy in those innovations.
    The head of dermatology might be working on her own sanctioned project to innovate
    on a problem. The chief nursing officer might have the job of marshalling a skunkworks
    team to build a new tool for nurses. And so on. It’s happening across the country.
    \n\nIt’s great to see such innovation products constantly entering the health
    IT space. The level of sophistication in just the last few years has jumped considerably
    and will likely continue it’s rapid improvement through the coming years. \n\n\n"

  :summary: Private, Public, and Hybrid clouds all exist in healthcare. Hybrid clouds
    represent the largest area of growth in healthcare organizations.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

    <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">

    </a>

    We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
  :post: |+
    ## Shift to IaaS

    For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

    Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

    The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

    * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
    * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

    That's a remarkable jump.

    ## Data Data Everywhere

    The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

    Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

    Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

    ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

    What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

    The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

    The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

    ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

    |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
    |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
    |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
    |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
    |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
    |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

    ## What this means to healthcare

    We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

    We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.
