:summary: 'Datica sponsored the VUE15 event, which took place in Sarasota, FL, and
  moderated a panel on lessons learned in mobile health and the path forward. '
:blog_lead: "This week was the first [Voalte User Experience (VUE)](http://www.voalte.com/vue15/)
  conference. Datica sponsored the event, which took place in Sarasota, FL, and moderated
  a panel on lessons learned in mobile health and the path forward. We were happy
  to be included in the event and to support it; we’re also very excited to be working
  with Voalte. \n"
:post: "Overall, it was a great learning and collaborative experience. In talking
  with [Trey Lauderdale](http://www.voalte.com/about-us/trey-lauderdale/), Voalte
  founder and CEO, prior to the event, I asked him why Voalte decided to do a user
  meeting this year for the first time and not in previous years. He told me Voalte
  wanted to assure they had enough customers and experiences to put together a two-day
  event filled with high quality content. Voalte wanted attendees to walk away feeling
  like they got real value out of attending the event. Voalte succeeded in that goal,
  and did it with typical Voalte personality, and a lot of pink scrubs and [Gator](http://www.ufl.edu/)
  references. It was a refreshing experience to be a part of such an intimate, collaborative
  event.\n\nFor those that don’t know Voalte, you likely will soon. \n\nThey provide
  a healthcare communications platform that integrates text, voice, alarm management,
  and a slew of other features to facilitate clinical communications, improve efficiencies,
  and ultimately improve the safety and care of patients. Some statistics about Voalte
  from the conference:\n\n- Voalte has signed over 150 healthcare facilities;\n- Voalte
  has delivered over 165 million text messages;\n- Voalte has delivered over 250 million
  automated messages from things like bed alarms;\n- Voalte has raised over $60M dollars
  in venture funding to support its growth;\n- Voalte has 4 products - Voalte Platform
  (new), Voalte Me, Voalte One, and now Voalte Story.\n\nVoalte has a [new partnership
  with Uber](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voalte-uber-smh-unite-to-help-address-patient-transportation-challenges-300177760.html)
  to improve attendance at follow-up appointments for discharged patients. Voalte
  Platform is an inevitable and powerful evolution for Voalte. It’s a completely new
  technology that is built from the ground up to be flexible and open. It exposes
  much of the functionality of Voalte via API and SDK, empowering customers and partners
  to customize and extend Voalte as they see fit. This openness is something that
  will enable much of what customers talked about as things they want to see in Voalte.\n\nWhat’s
  particularly interesting about Voalte is where it sits in the clinical landscape.
  As many have said, including us at datica, the EHR today is the hub of clinical
  data and workflows. But, as many also have said, care is largely about communication
  and EHRs were not built for communication, they were built for documentation and
  to serve as the clinical database. As [EHRs like Epic](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/integrating-with-epic-or-any-ehr/)
  release mobile tools like Rover for nursing workflows and Cerner releases its own
  apps for particular workflows, we’re going to see a lot of deep app-linking. But,
  I also think Voalte’s rich communication functionality, tied to its [openness via
  API](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/open-apis-solve-lack-of-ehr-interoperability/), makes
  it the likely candidate to be the communications layer for clinical care. And that
  communication layer now doesn’t have to be outside the EHR, but can be integrated
  into the mobile and desktop EHR workflows.\n\nThe event wasn’t just about Voalte.
  One of the more interesting topics discussed was alarm management and alarm fatigue.
  Voalte integrates alarms to deliver them to users via the Voalte apps. A topic of
  several sessions at VUE was managing the number and delivery of alarms. Organizations
  presented data on different departments and different types of alarms. Several healthcare
  organizations had modified alarming rules and criteria to reduce the number of alarms
  while maintaining the safety of patients. It’s impressive how they have been able
  to achieve this. A major theme was coming together as a group to publish evidence-based
  standards for alarm criteria, something that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nIt was interesting
  to hear people from places like University of Iowa, UCSF, Sarasota Memorial Hospital,
  and Tampa General Hospital talk about what their goals are for enhancements and
  additions to the Voalte experience for users. Some of the things mentioned several
  times were integration with EHR mobile apps for clinical workflows, integration
  with clinician and call schedules, and integration of more clinical data from the
  EHR to add context and value to communications.\n\nOne topic, which is emerging
  as a topic at several organizations leveraging Voalte Me instead of pagers, was
  a need for clinicians to be able to disconnect. With pages, clinicians could only
  carry them when on call. With clinical communications via personal smartphones,
  this is not possible. What’s funny is we’re dealing with the same issues at Datica
  with our use of Slack. We have coverage schedules for off-hours issues and downtime,
  but not everybody is on call all the time. The problem is people sometimes get mentioned
  in the middle of the night for things that, to put it mildly, are not emergencies.
  I think the topics of message and chat etiquette are active areas not just for Voalte,
  but for all organizations moving away from email and to messaging tools.\n\nKudos
  to Voalte for the hard work that went into putting together a great first user conference.
  I’m sure after the success of this week, and the growth plans for Voalte, this will
  not be the last VUE event. We look forward to our continued collaboration with Voalte
  and support for future VUE events.\n\n"

  :summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as
    connected health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
  :blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is
    very often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
    or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
    they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track
    an individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health
    is much more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality
    in today’s world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative
    strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day
    lives of people.
  :post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed
    Joe Kvedar, MD](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President,
    Connected Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet
    of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/) which is packed with
    real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors
    drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been a proponent
    of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest HIT influencers
    in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems to be solved.
    Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable
    sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected health journey\nSome
    aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re only likely a
    few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health journey.
    Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1. **The
    future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
    is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
    prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
    offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
    is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
    it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
    already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr.
    Kvedar explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate
    that data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis
    will become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
    the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
    that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
    digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
    it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says.
    “The next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create
    a unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected
    health journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example,
    motivating them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting
    to happen today despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr.
    Kvedar says the business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance,
    United Health Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device.
    If they achieve three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that
    wearable device, they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome
    parts of the healthcare industry seem to embrace the connected health journey
    faster than others. “Companies like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking
    in wearables’ data and giving consumers something back in return. They are all
    seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of
    the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs and hospitals are used to
    making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't quite figured out
    how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward hospitals for
    keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges are happily
    being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability \nEven
    though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for consumers,
    there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area of interoperability.
    \ Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n \n- **Proprietary
    technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s financial best
    interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you are an IT vendor,
    almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom all the way down
    to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in and upsell you
    new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering
    their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep
    you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On the
    hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven by
    the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
    a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
    to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
    interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
    award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible
    way hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could
    conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government
    purchasers that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have
    a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump
    administration, but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world
    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and
    chronic illness management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing
    health technology devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic
    illnesses but also helping to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n-
    **Wearables provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't
    result in symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol,
    visceral fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't
    really, on a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context,
    you can think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables
    provide feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a
    Fitbit, for example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be
    motivated to walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always
    motivate a lifestyle change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation.
    “It turns out there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t
    care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
    person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback
    loop is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains.
    That could be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe
    continues, “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in
    the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is
    the Spire device that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory
    rate; it tells you whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe
    differently under different conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables
    market as data becomes more meaningful to people with insights rather than just
    numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians
    today are inundated with data, most of it today within the EHR. Clinicians spend
    too much time clicking, finding, charting, and checking boxes to document the
    in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard to imagine connected health
    data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy process. Dr. Kvedar suggests
    this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n \n1. **The current state:**
    Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr. Kvedar sees connected health
    in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We have quite a few examples of
    that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and a lot of our primary care
    practices are patient centers or medical homes as part of our population health
    management structure. In those practices, there is someone whose responsibility
    is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide that person
    with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that are either
    difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is not enough
    of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
    is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to
    get their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags
    the patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort
    through. Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something
    that really needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**
    \ Most industries today are already using intelligent analysis software and data
    science that creates meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data.
    Dr. Kvedar describes how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at
    the beginning of a new era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've
    been tracking their blood pressure for the last two months. We should be able
    to give you a dashboard view that shows what blood pressures are normal when they
    go up, why they go up. Do they go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do
    they go up after a meal? That would give you some real insight into how to care
    for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions that seeing this all become a reality
    with physicians is dependent on solving more than just the problems of data overload
    and dashboards. Here are two other important dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If
    you call it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds
    scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort
    of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration. Will that change? Not sure.
    Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by two years from now will be
    value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans are now doing this but
    the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason we did medical home
    across our system is because of value-based payments and it makes much more sense
    in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of AI.** “On the one hand,
    we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call it decision support,
    maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you
    are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how you frame it. And,
    of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that and how you convince
    docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going to get sued because
    there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right in the algorithm.”
    \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The pieces of connected
    health are here today, but we still have to put them together. Some of that will
    be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is even societal.”\n\nMake

  :summary: 'The buzz at HIMSS 2017: analytics, machine learning, AI, cyber-security,
    patient-centered care, and open data were a few themes we saw this year.'
  :blog_lead: "[HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/) is done. It’s time for
    the outpouring of commentaries on the event. And, amazingly, it’s already time
    to be thinking about next year if you’re an exhibitor. I realize the big companies
    do this but, at Datica, we too are planning and already booked our booth for next
    year. Thankfully we got a good booth space on the top floor and not in the basement
    (Vegas needs 2 levels to support HIMSS whereas Orlando only needs one massive
    level)."
  :post: "\n## Major Themes\n\nYou could have predicted these going into the event
    based on the sessions and promotional material.\n\n- **Analytics / machine learning
    / AI**. If I was to only pick one theme this year, this would be it. From Watson
    to Health Catalyst to the population health offerings of pretty much every EHR
    vendor, some form of analytics was woven into everything this year. Like patient
    engagement, a recurring HIMSS theme, [data analytics](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-benefits-of-accessible-big-data-analytics/)
    is seen as a major part of the future of care. Analytics does hold amazing potential
    but, like patient engagement, health systems need to develop strategies for how
    and where to use analytics if they are going to be successful. Analytics for analytics
    sake won’t help. Understanding the problems to solve or questions to answer with
    analytics is the key first step.\n- **Cybersecurity**. As more and more traditional
    health data goes digital, and more and more digital health data is generated by
    sensors and apps, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger topic. More health data flowing
    into more places means more financial risk of a [data breach](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    Cybersecurity is an essential part of digital health, just like cloud is an essential
    part of digital health. This should be a recurring theme of HIMSS as the next
    10 years are going to be defined by healthcare moving data between new technologies
    and between new partnerships.\n- **Patient-centered care**. This is the one I
    wasn’t sure if I should include because I feel like some variation of this has
    been a recurring theme. I guess being a constant theme still makes it a theme.
    The idea of [patient centricity](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-cmio-role-in-the-era-of-value-based-care/),
    maybe because it has been a constant theme, is starting to mature. Services need
    to be centered on patients, and many of those services will be technology driven.
    The reason for services need to be patient-centered is 1) that’s what patients
    expect today and 2) that is what providers, payors, and life sciences need to
    do to compete for patients, members, and customers. I think we’ve swung back from
    the days when we thought B2C, or going direct to consumer, would work across most
    patient populations. Groups like Healthgrades still own a lot of consumer health
    traffic but integrating those consumer tools with providers and more formal care
    is also a part of patient centricity. \n- **Open data**. This one definitely isn’t
    new. I remember hearing [Todd Park beating the drum about *data liberación*](http://healthstandards.com/blog/2015/06/23/data-liberacion/)
    back in 2011. It only took three more years for most EHR vendors to start to get
    behind a new standard called FHIR and another three or so years, until today,
    when EHRs are ready to expose data via FHIR. I’m bullish on FHIR as a potential
    data standard but highly skeptical of FHIR as a path to open data and innovation.
    We have projects like Argonaut driving towards new ways to use FHIR so we’ll have
    to wait and see how those develop. The overwhelming sentiment around open data
    is that access to data, ideally in a trusted and consistent bi-directional way,
    is the only way to build the technology ecosystem that’s needed to put patients
    at the center of care and start to drive towards the [triple aim].\n\n## Same
    same, but different\n\nThere’s a saying I first heard in Thailand and use from
    time to time - [*same same but different*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish).
    I think it pretty accurately describes my impression of HIMSS 2017.\n\nStepping
    back, looking at HIMSS as a whole, it felt like we had simply transported all
    the infrastructure and logistics from Vegas in 2016 to Orlando in 2017. It didn’t
    really feel too [much different from HIMSS 2015](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/himss-2015-recap/),
    for that matter. [HIStalkapalooza](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/visit-the-datica-vip-area-at-histalkapalooza-2017/)
    happened. The Athena party happened. Lots of bankers parties with better food
    and drink options. Uber didn’t work well. Restaurants were full all the time.
    Epic, Cerner, Athena and a few others still had the largest booths. Yeah, it felt
    like HIMSS.\n\nBut then, in other ways, it felt very different from previous years.
    The impression I got, on a consistent basis, is that people are burned out on
    the status quo. People are tired of HIMSS being the same year after year. People
    are tired of \"doing things to check boxes\", a reference to buying EHRs to get
    money from Meaningful Use, and \"want to really start making things happen\".
    These quotes are from people at large health systems, people in the same roles
    that would have said something like \"Epic is going to do that\" when asked about
    patient engagement or population health or pretty much anything health IT just
    a few years ago. These are decision makers at the core of the health IT industry
    and not just startups and investors. The tide has very clearly turned in the industry.\n\nThis
    is exciting! It will take time to see how quickly this sea change practically
    takes hold and we start to see more and more digital health technologies adopted
    and scaled at health systems. But, the process is starting and big systems are
    developing strategies and processes for the next 3-5 years. And, maybe the most
    shocking part, especially compared to several years ago, is that health systems
    are looking outside their EHR vendors for the future of health IT.\n\n*Want to

  :summary: 'Casey Bryson shares visions of healthcare''s digital future from HIMSS
    2017, including applications that scale and integrate with EHRs at lightning speed. '
  :blog_lead: "I am a visionary. I do not consider myself an entrepreneur. The team
    that surrounds me, my colleagues at Datica and our company advisors, build my
    entrepreneurial skills with each day that passes. \n "
  :post: "At [HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/), I surrounded myself with
    visionaries. I met with leaders of technology companies and healthcare providers.
    We shared our visions for the future of our industry and our conversations fuel
    how we build and execute our strategies. Most discussions focused on the forces
    pushing our industry to adopt SaaS solutions for digital health that improve patient
    outcomes, deliver excellent customer service, and create new models of care. The
    future vision includes applications that scale and integrate with EHRs at lightning
    speed. One quote I overheard said it best:\n\n> “We will be able to snap solutions
    on and off quickly to prove the concept and to find speed to value.”\n \nAs I
    reflect on my time on the exhibit hall floor at HIMSS it is clear that our industry’s
    digital culture is hyper-focused on the speed of innovation. For these visionaries,
    the future is very close. For other visionaries that don't share this focus, the
    future may be a frightening place.\n \nI got my start in HIT by installing [Health
    Information Management (HIM) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_information_management).
    I worked with HIM professionals across the country to define, produce, and protect
    the sanctity of the legal medical record. As I had a break in my schedule I decided
    to pop into an educational session led by an HIM director who I had met in my
    previous life. The topic was information governance; an enterprise, top-down approach
    to hard cost savings tied to managing information as a critical asset. [As AHIMA
    states](http://www.ahima.org/topics/infogovernance/igbasics), \n\n> “IG serves
    the dual purpose of optimizing the ability to extract clinical and business value
    from healthcare information while simultaneously meeting compliance needs and
    mitigating risk.”  \n\n## My vision for the future has been enhanced\n \nThe future
    of digital health must include information governance. It starts with process
    and a line of questioning but many questions should be eliminated by a standard
    approach by information technology. \n\n- What does this application do? \n- Does
    it integrate with my EHR? \n- Does the vendor manage patient identity or encounter/contact
    moves?\n- How do I process data corrections? \n- How do I limit the risk of e-discovery?
    \n- Is this data part of our Legal Medical Record or Designated Record Set? \n-
    How will I manage all of these questions as the speed of digital health and departmental
    applications become more of a reality?\n\nThe core of Datica’s mission is to help
    our clients do what they do, better, by eliminating barriers to digital adoption.
    If your desire is speed to value, IT and HIM have to work in harmony.\n \nMy vision
    for the future of digital health includes IT systems being armed with a partner
    to manage backups, encryption, patient identity, data retention policies, and
    focus on data integration from the need to drive workflow and to support the production
    of the record. \n\nI may not be an entrepreneur historically but my team has taught
    me that you have to focus on your core competencies to arrive at greatness, otherwise,
    you will end up being mediocre at everything. If you’d like to discuss health
    information management as we move toward a digital environment, drop me a line
