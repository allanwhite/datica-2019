  > Every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing. – Barry Finlay, *Kilimanjaro and Beyond*

  Today we are proud to announce the immediate availability of our integration solution product – **Redpoint**.
:post: |2+

  ### Redpoint? What’s that? What does that mean?

  We’re glad you asked. The term *redpoint* is a climbing term which describes a clean ascent made after previously unsuccessful trial attempts. Much like climbers, we strive to reach the top. A redpoint can be achieved successfully nearly every time because all the quick draws have already been put into place so climbers can simply clip their ropes and go. Equivalently in healthcare, our product Redpoint will deliver the same successful result for our customer’s integrations.

  ### Integration is a journey

  If there is one guiding belief which drives Catalyze, it's the view that healthcare integration is a process. It's not an API, it's not knowing someone at Epic. It's a journey fraught with misinformation and pitfalls. This journey needs a guide.

  Fortunately, Catalyze has already gone through the trials, the burdens, the headaches, the agonies and the pains of figuring out this “stuff” so our customers don’t have to. Internally we often view ourselves as *sherpas* for our customers. Now we are extending that belief to the world using Redpoint.

  For those of you unfamiliar with the term *sherpa*, it is analogous with *mountaineer*, but not just any mountaineer – the elite mountaineer, the pioneer. Pioneering the industry’s transformation to value-based care, Catalyze exists to partner with innovative digital health companies by providing [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://catalyze.io/hitrust) infrastructure products. This allows our partners to focus on what matters to them rather than compliance or integration concerns. Being their integration partner, we provide *all* of the necessary components, and the committed support organization, to get our partners to the summit. We are the sherpa and [Redpoint](https://catalyze.io/redpoint) is our tool.

  [Redpoint](https://catalyze.io/redpoint) manages the entire healthcare integration process with a completely new user experience along with three novel components:

  1. **Scripts** — pre-configured sets of EHR integrations packaged to enable specific workflows for digital health companies
  2. **Connectors** — tools to automate secure connectivity to and from EHRs
  3. **Bearings** — manages delicate project management requirements throughout an integration

  In order to successfully integrate with EHRs and have data integration as a core part of a digital health app value proposition, you need all the above components. Just 1 or 2 of them will not get you to your destination.

  By providing the industry’s leading integration services, Redpoint was inspired and created as a natural product evolution. Its components are designed to guide vendors through the entire process of a healthcare integration. Scripts are custom-built workflows for digital health use cases. Some workflows require multiple, bi-directional EHR interfaces, but Redpoint customers simply get the APIs they require without needing to become experts in setting up or managing EHR interfaces. EHR integration is only part of the interface problem though. The other major challenge is securing connections, typically through VPN, to health systems; this problem only grows exponentially when scaling. Connectors automate the creation and management of secure connections, eliminating that burden for digital health vendors. Bearings round out the complimentary mix of components by managing specific project management requirements along the journey.

  **Interested in Redpoint?** Send us a [tweet](https://twitter.com/catalyzeio) or [email](mailto:hello@catalyze.io) so we can set you up with one of our experts to discuss your integration needs. Also, subscribe to our blog to stay up to date on what you need to know.
