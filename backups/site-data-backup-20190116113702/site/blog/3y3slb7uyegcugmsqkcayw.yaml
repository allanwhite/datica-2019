:blog_lead: "Datica proudly attended the first annual Open mHealth Summit 2015 hosted
  in San Francisco. The conference was sold out and our very own [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/)
  and [Mark Olschesky](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/mark/) were among the IT executives
  to attend. The audience was suffused with energy from persons bursting with creative
  intentions as the power-packed speakers, including Olschesky, spoke their expertise
  on topics ranging from [FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir/) to bringing down the
  barriers of integration. \n"
:post: "[Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) is doing some exciting work these
  days. We got to take a look into their schemas and design principles, understanding
  that one of the common canons we share is the value in open sourcing documentation.
  But also got to discuss data - how data is integrated, stored, shared, processed,
  and visualized. We touched other topics like how to utilize HealthKit outside of
  HealthKit, and even the collaborative work that we at Datica have done with Open
  mHealth. If you want to learn more, check out their documentation [here](http://www.openmhealth.org/documentation/#/overview/get-started).\n\nAlthough
  the speakers were phenomenal, we can’t discredit the level of cognition and presence
  the audience held. Industry leaders from a large range of organizations such as
  the Department of Veteran Affairs, UCSF, HealthLoop, Kaiser, Aetana, and Validic
  were in attendance just to name a few. But if you thought that these great minds
  would be content sitting back and enjoying the show, you would have been mistaken.
  Nearly all members of the audience were engaged and contributing to conversation
  thanks to Open mHealth creating such a collaborative environment for all, especially
  during the afternoon’s breakout sessions to discuss the state of the Open mHealth
  platform, design around the digital health data, and clinical measures, schemas,
  and data science. \n\nA recurring theme that rang loud and clear was the emphasis
  on the transition to preventative healthcare and patient engagement which was music
  to our ears! We cannot stress these topics enough and how thankful we are to hear
  our values echoed through our fellow industry leaders. We could go incessantly on
  these topics alone but for now we’ll just say to stay tuned as we plan to cover
  much more on these in future blog posts. \n\nAll and all, the first annual Open
  mHealth Summit was a huge success and we feel overly humbled that we got to not
  only be in attendance, but got to speak on HL7 integration and FHIR topics. Conversations
  have inspired internal and external conversations alike here at Datica and we couldn’t
  be more thrilled with our takeaways. With such amazing results and turnout this
  year, we look forward to returning to attend and discussing the industry’s evolution
  in 2016!\n"
