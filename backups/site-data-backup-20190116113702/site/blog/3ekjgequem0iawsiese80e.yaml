:summary: 'One thing is certain: healthcare still has a security problem. Out of 295
  breaches reported so far for 2017, 132 are hacking/IT incident breaches.'
:blog_lead: "The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil
  Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information.
  The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the
  [HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html
  ). \n\nBecause entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report it,
  complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However, a look
  at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be instructive
  as we all prepare for the more stringent [penalties of GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)
  coming in May of 2018. "
:post: "## HIPAA Security is still a problem\n\nOne thing is certain: healthcare [still
  has a security problem](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
  The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT
  incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
  2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg\"
  alt=\"2017 Data Breaches by Type\">\n\nOne of the largest, which occurred at Airway
  Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in a
  network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and reported
  the breach to HHS in June. \n\nAccording to [a story about the Airway Oxygen breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier)
  in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed
  an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and
  applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed
  monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a cybersecurity
  firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact. \n\nThe story
  of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all of those security
  measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s no way of knowing, of
  course, but it certainly is a question worth asking. \n\n## Many types of entities
  are at risk, not only healthcare providers\n\nAnother interesting thing about the
  reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities reported breaches.
  It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered security woes; insurers,
  state departments of human services, software companies, and other types of covered
  entities and business associates have reported breaches as well. \n\nLate in 2016
  and continuing into early in 2017, [MongoDB databases fell victim to ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html)
  attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due to
  any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice)
  that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special
  hacking tool.” \n\nMongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software,
  but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September
  2017, as many as 26,000 [databases were hijacked and held for ransom](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find).
  Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in the
  attacks, along with other entities. \n\n## Lessons from others’ mistakes\n\nOn December
  28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st Century
  Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)
  twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI) was
  being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals. \n\nThe FBI found that the
  breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server.
  As many as 2.2 million people were affected. \n\nThe settlement was for 21CO to
  pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to
  an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein & Lehr LLP,\nthe results
  of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into [what all healthcare
  entities should be doing](https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement):
  \n\n> The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate
  and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI);
  (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities
  to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement procedures to regularly
  review records of its information system activity; and, (iv) disclosed PHI to third
  party vendors who were acting as business associate without having written business
  associate agreement in place.” \n\nThe CAP that 21CO agreed to includes completing
  a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising security policies and procedures,
  and cataloging its business associate agreements, among several other steps. \n\nSaul
  Ewing Arnstein & Lehr offer advice to other business required to comply with HIPAA
  regulations, writing, \n\n> As we begin 2018, covered entities and business associates
  should revisit their HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification policies and
  procedures to ensure internal compliance and make timely adjustments as appropriate.”
  \n\nAs we move through 2018 and toward May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations
  becomes effective, it behooves us all to pay close attention to how much we are
  at risk of a data breach—not only with HIPAA, but also [with GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/).
  After all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that
  amount in GDPR fines.\n\nLet Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for
  your digital health application with our HITRUST-certified healthcare platform.

  :summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of
    band authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is
    responding.
  :blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
    kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
    attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from
    White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent
    one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
    more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
    ourselves.
  :post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
    and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
    organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization
    is immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the
    widespread issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of
    Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update,
    specifically [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html),
    includes important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods
    versus a single source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
    is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
    and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
    makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity
    proofing\n \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates
    out identity authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and
    authentication proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have
    the proper credentials to access a file, server, or other data containing device
    or software,” explained Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole
    question is: How do we prove John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance
    is important to Datica customers who live and breathe in an environment awash
    with protected health information. More and more the healthcare industry is affected
    by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
    that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
    ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high
    price on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n
    \nThis clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because
    that will change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an
    organization, a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the
    victim’s accounts.\n \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n
    \nThe engineering team is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to
    disallow email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to
    the problem of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
    risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected
    health information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach
    to helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
    chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why
    Datica developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    platform initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become
    HITRUST CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security
    and compliance a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica
    at hello@datica.com to arrange a quick chat about your needs and to learn more
    about how the Datica Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

  :summary: As we roll into the end of 2017, it's worth looking back on how the industry
    has been doing protecting PHI against the threat of cyber-intrusions.
  :blog_lead: 'As we roll into the last few months of the year, it''s worth looking
    back on how the industry has been doing protecting PHI and adapting to the increasingly
    threatening world of cyber-intrusions. While the big stories generally revolve
    around the largest amount of lives impacted and the most technically harrowing
    attacks, it''s worth noting that there are still breaches as simple as someone
    stealing a laptop with a spreadsheets with thousands of persons worth of PHI on
    it. In this article, we''re going to go through some of the largest breaches of
    2017 and discuss how we address these as a company which we''ve shared in our
    open-source policies. While it''s impossible to say in retrospect if any breach
    was 100% preventable, having policies in place to provide "reasonable effort"
    to prevent exposure is key to minimizing the damage from the unpreventable. '
  :post: "## Ransomware or Malware\n\nAt top of mind in 2017 is ransomware and malware,
    which shut down and exposed multiple hospitals and HIT Vendors thoughout the year.
    Of those, two were notable:\n\n-  [Pacific Alliance Medical Center attack potentially
    leaks 260K patients](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/los-angeles-provider-breached-ransomware-attack-over-260000-patients-affected-updated)\n-
    \ [Nuance Impacted for Weeks Due to Malware](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cybersecurity/cyber-attack-update-nuance-still-down-researchers-believe-petya-not)\n\nThe
    vector of the attack is relatively straightforward: through phishing or infected
    3rd party hardware like a thumb drive, hackers gain access to hardware throughout
    an organization's network and encrypt data on that hardware. The purpose of ransomware
    is to extract payment to undo that encryption while other malware like the ones
    believed to be used in the Nuance attack are wholly irreversible and are just
    designed to effectively destroy the data.\n\nPreventing something like an attack
    like this actually hits to the heart of most of our policies, but let's go for
    the top 3 references in this article. First, [patch management](https://policy.datica.com/#9.5-patch-management-procedures)
    ensures that you are constantly being vigilant to new security concerns. While
    it's not directly stated in our policies, we have one person and a backup who
    are wholly responsible for managing patches for our system for security concerns.
    Second, having policies on [appropriate system access and by reducing the need
    for privledged users](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification)
    reduces the risk that if one user's credentials are compromised all systems could
    be accessible by an attacker. Third, we run [OSSEC and Anti-Virus](https://policy.datica.com/#17.4-prevention-of-malware-on-production-systems)
    on all production systems to identify any otherwise unknown attacks and to solve
    any issues brought up from an attack.\n\n## Unauthorized Access or Disclosure\n\n-
    [Indiana Medicaid warns patients of health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/indiana-medicaid-warns-patients-health-data-breach)\n-
    [Phishing attack at UC Davis leads to health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phishing-attack-uc-davis-health-breaches-data-15000-patients)\n\nOther
    than a vector for malware, [phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/)
    can also be used as a method for attackers to simply gain access to systems by
    getting credentials to a system. Or, a well-meaning dev may accidentally breach
    patient data by placing it on a public facing web page. \n\nWhile your mileage
    may vary, our policies have a few tips to help prevent this. First, we require
    [two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#17.7-production-system-security)
    on all production systems. While this doesn't necessarily prevent a system user
    from giving an attacker their credentials *and* auth token (sigh), it reduces
    the risk of unauthorized cross application access and minimizes the window by
    which an attacker can maintain access to an application. We also require access
    to all production systems to be [managed over a VPN with two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
    We also have an unofficial \"All data is potentially PHI\" policy for our managed
    integration services hardware/software. While we may have access to test environments
    with mock patient data, we assume that we may be sent PHI from any vendor or healthcare
    organization. As such, we protect all data like PHI as established in our policies.
    \n\n## Theft or Improper Disposal\n\n- [WSU hard drive theft potentially impacts
    1 million people](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/wsu-hard-drive-theft-potentially-impacts-1-million-people)\n-
    [State Employee Dumps Medicaid Worksheets in dumpster](http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/state-employee-dumps-medicaid-worksheets-in-dumpster/article_13f36eb4-1fb4-5278-93e1-1d30a00c9f9a.html)\n\nWhile
    hackers and ransomeware are increasingly perilous, [20% of data breaches reported
    to the OCR are good old fashioned theft and improper disposal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
    Someone stealing a laptop from a car or a unencrypted hard drive from an office
    to cause a breach are a tale as old as HIPAA itself.\n\nWe may be biased, but
    **stop storing PHI on local machines or on paper**. [We don't](https://policy.datica.com/#7.13-access-to-ephi).
    We only used [approved tools](https://policy.datica.com/#20.-approved-tools-policy)
    with appropriate access controls and encryption to store and transfer PHI. We
    also have [no servers in our offices](https://policy.datica.com/#10.-facility-access-policy)
    and BAAs with our cloud providers. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon't [learn about HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    the hard way, either getting beat up by your first 250-question audit or worse:
    by finding yourself on the OCR's Wall of Shame. Consult our policies or let us
    do the lifting for you on our thrice-audited, HITRUST-certified [compliant Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/).

  :summary: In the 377 healthcare data breaches last year, phishing attacks were among
    the top data breach causes. Why is healthcare such a target for spear phishing
    attacks?
  :blog_lead: "At the beginning of August, the BBC reported that a UK-based “prankster”
    had successfully [spoofed the White House.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40788080)
    Through spear phishing emails, this bad actor had not only convinced a senior
    cyber security officer that he was the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor
    Jared Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus
    to fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory
    email exchanges. After posting a few of those emails on Twitter, the culprit promised
    not to do it again and urged the current administration to “tighten up IT policy.”
    While the jokester later indicated his email spoofing had no harmful intent, the
    implications go way beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n"
  :post: "Phishing is a widely used form of social engineering where malicious ne’re-do-wells
    broadcast  disguised emails to a large population in an attempt to steal sensitive
    information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
    not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with
    the term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America
    Online (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked
    themselves as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and
    Ebay. These fraudulent emails would often persuade victims to open a link with
    a malevolent attachment or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing
    scams bred a more targeted type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
    For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
    if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
    someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
    subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
    Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches
    last year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
    report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
    hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches.
    Furthermore, spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting
    CEOs. From 2015 to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent.
    In the first part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health,
    Torrance Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according
    to Healthcare IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so
    far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
    This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
    With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
    spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
    Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica
    Security Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear
    phishing: high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for
    ransomware and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security
    walls when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what
    they want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization,
    is also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing
    attempt that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one
    of our executive’s email addresses. He or she used that email address to request
    a wire transfer from the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the
    department head alerted the appropriate person within Datica about the email and
    its request, and ultimately averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example
    to warn its own customers to such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance
    Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare organizations can better protect themselves
    from such attacks. Her recommendations and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n###
    Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll employees need to be made aware of what
    phishing is and the damage that can result from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines
    the steps he uses to fully inform Datica employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing
    email looks like, explaining how to evaluate such an email and then confirming
    that employees know to whom suspicious emails should be forwarded for evaluation
    are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions that could breach an organization’s
    thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic testing of employees’ knowledge
    and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting internal spear phishing lures
    that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions against doing testing
    at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular that on October
    1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals. \n\n###
    Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in place
    as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is trying
    to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should have
    the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
    Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then
    managing any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program
    “Having zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational
    goal,” says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation
    steps.” \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in
    HITRUST. Datica joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States
    to achieve [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)
    status and believes that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is
    the best way to protect its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity
    and compliance are deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).
    If you’ve ever had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment
    on the Datica platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of
    double verification. The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing
    department to quickly verify and make customer requested adjustments for access.
    Datica utilizes stringent measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers.
    These steps combined with the recommendations above better protect your organization
    for a spear phishing attack. \n"

  :summary: By now you've heard of the CloudFlare leak of sensitive data. There's
    a specific part of HIPAA legislation that health care should be concerned about.
  :blog_lead: |-
    By now you've likely heard of the [CloudFlare parser bug](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) that caused CloudFlare's CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, [a serious problem](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/834900838837411840), or [a historic event](https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/834905083976552449).

    At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/hipaa/). Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?

    As it turns out there's a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.
  :post: "## The Conduit Exception\n\n[We've written in the past](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/the-hipaa-privacy-rule/)
    how the [Omnibus rule for HIPAA](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),
    introduced in 2013, has affected companies doing business in the healthcare industry.
    One important clarification made in the Omnibus rule is additional guidance around
    what does and does not fall under HIPAA and the conduit exception.\n\nThe conduit
    exception was introduced for reasons of practicality. In effect, the exception
    states that no legal agreements are required between covered entities and organizations
    that merely act as \"conduits\" for ePHI.\n\nIn the physical world this makes
    a lot of sense. Without this exception it would be impossible for your doctor
    to discuss health issues over the phone or send medical bills over postal mail.\n\nThings
    become a little blurrier in the electronic world. What exactly is the difference
    between an organization/service acting as a conduit for information and an organization/service
    acting as a business associate?\n\nAccording to the [legal wording](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),\n\n>
    … data transmission organizations that do not require access to protected health
    information on a routine basis would not be treated as business associates. This
    is consistent with our prior interpretation of the definition of \"business associate,\"
    through which we have stated that entities that act as mere conduits for the transport
    of protected health information but do not access the information other than on
    a random or infrequent basis are not business associates.\n\nThis is further clarified
    with:\n\n> The conduit exception is a narrow one and is intended to exclude only
    those entities providing mere courier services, such as the U.S. Postal Service
    or United Parcel Service and their electronic equivalents, such as, internet service
    providers (ISPs) providing mere data transmission services. As we have stated
    in prior guidance, a conduit transports information but does not access it other
    than on a random or infrequent basis as necessary to perform the transportation
    service or as required by other law.\n\nSo the final rule clearly calls out ISPs
    as falling under the conduit exemption and that a \"random or infrequent basis\"
    is the dividing line. This is a logical extension of the physical examples given
    earlier.\n\n## Are CDNs Exempt?\n\nUnfortunately, the final rule does not cover
    CDN services explicitly. Let's consider some of the cases where using a CDN makes
    sense and map them to the guidelines above.\n\nOne typical use for CDNs is to
    place static content geographically closer to end users, for example, static HTML
    or Javascript libraries. These are obviously not ePHI but often fall under HIPAA
    for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, if you have a web application and are dynamically
    loading Javascript from a CDN, and if that CDN were ever compromised, any maliciously-injected
    code could feasibly be used to exfiltrate ePHI out of your application. If you're
    not cryptographically verifying the content downloaded from the CDN you are opening
    up yourself to attack vectors. In this case, the CDN would _definitely_ not be
    covered by the conduit exemption; after all, it is storing executable code on
    your behalf.\n\nAnother use involves using the CDN to proxy an application server,
    essentially acting as a global caching layer. Some CDNs claim that because they
    offer encryption support (HTTPS), and they are simply acting as a path for cached
    information, they are exempt under the conduit exception. Unfortunately this argument
    is invalid and falls apart under scrutiny.\n\nSome CDNs require you to upload
    a copy of your HTTPS certificate and private key in order to get HTTPS support.
    In this case, if that certificate is also used to protect ePHI, this is _definitely_
    not covered by the conduit exception. You are providing keying material that can
    be used to decrypt sensitive information. Not only would this fall under HIPAA
    legislation, this is bad security hygiene.\n\nEven if the CDN uses a separate
    HTTPS certificate and private key, if it is acting as a proxy in front of a health-related
    application the CDN's servers will likely receive, decrypt, and transmit ePHI.
    In contrast with an ISP the CDN will have access to ePHI on much more than a \"random
    or infrequent\" basis.\n\nAdditionally, simple metadata related to some websites
    may be sensitive. How would you feel if leaked HTTP request logs showed a username
    that corresponds with your Twitter handle visiting an intensely personal website
    such as [a disease-focused dating site](https://www.mpwh.com/)? Depending on what
    information is tracked in the request URLs, even web server access logs may inadvertently
    contain ePHI.\n\nOne can picture data centers full of HTTPS frontends silently
    processing data that may contain sensitive information. Given that the CDN staff
    has administrative access to those machines, how can you be sure any ePHI that
    happens to traverse through their network is being properly protected? What legal
    actions do you have in case it is not being handled correctly?\n\n## The Importance
    of the BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n\nThese issues were some of the key
    motivators for introducing the concept of the [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements),
    or BAA. In HIPAA, these legal agreements are used for a few important reasons:\n\n1.
    To clearly define expectations around how both parties follow HIPAA regulations,
    particularly around how data containing ePHI will be managed.\n2. To delineate
    the risks and responsibilities between both parties, particularly around breach
    notifications and penalties.\n\nWithout such a legal agreement in place allowing
    a third party to access data containing ePHI is a risky proposition. How will
    you know if data is being properly protected? If a security incident happens related
    to ePHI for your customers, how you will be notified so you can take appropriate
    actions?\n\nIf there is no agreement in place there is not a clear legal course
    of action to take in the event of a breach. In fact, given the way HIPAA regulations
    are enforced, without a BAA **you will be liable for any mistakes made by that
    third party.**\n\nThe fiscal repercussions of being on the hook for a breach caused
    by a third party is compelling enough for organizations to ensure that any services
    they use are covered under a BAA. But more importantly, the legal framework of
    the BAA means that you will have done at least a token amount of due diligence
    in protecting your customer's ePHI data. Allowing sensitive data to flow through
    a third party without such diligence is irresponsible and shows a complete lack
    of respect for your customer's basic privacy rights.\n\nOr as Gene Fry [summarized
    so succinctly](http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/hipaa-conduit-exception-rule/):\n\n>
    Any provider that states they are fully HIPAA compliant will sign a BAA with you,
    and if they don’t, you’re putting your organization and patients’ data at risk.\n\n##
    Impact of the CloudFlare Breach\n\nGiven the scale at which CloudFlare operates,
    the impact of this breach will likely take a long time to fully flesh out. While
    [CloudFlare reacted quickly to respond to this breach](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139)
    it will take some time to regain the trust they lost with this catastrophic mistake.\n\nTo
    the best of our knowledge CloudFlare has never offered a BAA for their customers,
    which means that any organization that used CloudFlare's CDN capabilities with
    ePHI needs to start invoking their breach procedures **now.** We hope all such
    organizations do the right thing and help protect any sensitive data entrusted
    to them by their customers.\n\n*Learn more about how [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud)

    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
