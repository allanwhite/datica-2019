:summary: 'It''s true: 2015 is beginning to show that hospitals are stemming their
  primary initiatives from patient engagement. When the HITECH Act was passed back
  in 2009, hospitals and all medical facilities started to create patient portals
  to assure that patients would be able to view, download, and even transmit their
  medical profiles and information as they see fit. But as the latest findings will
  report, not only are patient engagement stratagem taking priority, but data security
  is at the forefront as well, closing the loop on the rising number of patient data

:post: "Better alliance between clinicians and healthcare providers is being facilitated
  by the transition between volume-based care to value-based care. The clinician portal
  is an indispensable solution in strengthening this alignment in ideologies. Past
  that requirement, clinicians and hospitals are allowing patients to be actively
  involved in their treatments by offering complete access to the portals through
  mobile applications. \n\nWith this rise in mobile utilization, there must also be
  a rise in mobile data security. Whether it be mobile data security purchases from
  hospitals or various other types of data protection, the industry has shifted its
  focus across the board to showcase the relationship between patient engagement and
  data security. Major improvements can be seen in patient portals, administrative
  management platforms, and healthcare IT systems. \n\nSome considerations for those
  providing patient data through mobile devices:\n\n- Be sure to deploy, test, and
  install mobile health security platforms.\n- After implementation, all staff will
  need training on system utilization.\n- This training should be based off a mobile
  health security policy enacted by the healthcare organization.\n- When developing
  this policy consider understanding vendor approaches to security, cost and risk
  analysis of various products, usability restrictions, procurement of mobile devices,
  HIPAA security compliance, and mobile analytics. \n\nAs with all mobile technologies,
  there really is no comprehensive data security solution that will make all of your
  worries disappear. Understand what your expectations of these patient engagement
  technologies are and address all the security risks behind those expectations set.\n\nYou
