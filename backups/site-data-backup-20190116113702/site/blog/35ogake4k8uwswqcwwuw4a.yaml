:summary: 'There are two broad classifications facilitated towards patient engagement:

:blog_lead: "There are two broad classifications facilitated towards patient engagement:
  organizational and individual. Organizational-level engagement implementations are
  executed by means of change in policies, processes, systems, procedures, or structures.
  On the other side, individual-level engagement tactics are enacted to reshape knowledge,
  demeanors, or skills through various tools for educating and engaging the individual.
  These two ranks are not mutually exclusive though. Individual-level tools can support
  organizational-level interventions and individual characteristics can be aided by
  organizational support. \n"
:post: "Organizational Engagement can be categorized into four main groups:\n\n1.
  **The Team.** Engagement tactics utilized with patients and family members by the
  healthcare team can include bedside rounds, patient/family facilitated response
  groups, efforts to encourage familial participation, and granting access to medical
  record information. \n2. **Enabling Open Dialogue.** Knowledge of the staff members
  that are involved in a patient’s care and a strategy for guiding clinician-patient
  interactions are examples of ways to facilitate communication between patients and
  providers. \n3. **Patient Education.** Strategies to strengthen engagement can include
  establishing systems for care coordination, creating systems for patients/families
  to track medications and health records, clinician communication, and allowing access
  to PHI.\n4. **Management Input.** Family advisory councils can be implemented at
  the healthcare enterprise level, but also simply allowing opportunities for patients
  to be involved and elicit feedback can prove to be a powerful engagement tool.\n\nThere
  are four classifications for engagement at the individual level as well:\n\n1. **Active
  Involvement.** Majority of engagement tools fall into this category and address
  patient safety, provider communication, care coordination, and infection prevention.\n2.
  **Partnerships.** Individuals can become part of councils to advise organizations
  so their voices can be heard while providing guidance for healthcare entities as
  to what consumers desire. \n3. **Professionals.** Almost all engagement tools are
  focused towards clinicians vs. the broad range of healthcare professionals. These
  tools are almost always applicable to solely physicians and nurses.\n4. **Leadership.**
  Most of these components can be narrowly focused on steps and tips for organizations
  to promote and support internal change.\n\nOverall, there is a lot of room for improvement
  in the world of patient engagement. More tools need to be created to measure effectiveness,
  feasibility, and efficacy. In addition to that, an environmental scan needs to be
  sought to identify gaps and to target appropriate audiences.\n\n"

  :summary: An overwhelming majority of patients are already sharing data or would
    be willing to share data with providers and motivated patients are a very good
    thing.
  :blog_lead: There's a recent report and [infographic](http://www.mobiquityinc.com/get-mobile-get-healthy-appification-health-fitness-infographic)
    that surveyed over a thousand consumers and asked them questions related to tracking
    their own health, searching for health information online, and about sharing health
    data about themselves with healthcare providers. The report found that an overwhelming
    majority are already sharing data or would be willing to share data with providers.
    That's fantastic! Motivated patients are a very good thing.
  :post: |2+

    This is a trend that the health system should encourage and help foster. Interesting, to me at least, is that the report found that 70% of the people that shared data with providers thought providers were interested in the patient reported data. That finding surprises me because it doesn't fit into the way that the vast majority of providers deliver, document, and get reimbursed for care today. With very limited time per patient visit, going through tons of new data is not always feasible or encouraged. Self tracking is exactly in line with the goals of healthcare in terms of patient engagement and ownership of patient health. If individuals are actively measuring and quantifying themselves and they want to share that information, it should be encouraged to create a return on that individual investment and effort.

    I have personal experiences with family that have wanted to share their own data and been blown off by physicians. An example is my dad. We got him an iPhone-connected glucometer a couple years ago and, in his excitement, he emailed his endocrinologist his data ahead of an appointment. The endocrinologist flat out told him that he couldn't really use the data. My dad now sends me his weekly reports of blood sugars, which is helpful because I can encourage him but it would be great if his physician supported and encouraged his enthusiasm for self-care.

    The second piece of that report found that those individuals, the ones who want to share data, also want to have trust in the way that the data is being shared, and the [security and privacy of their data](https://datica.com/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/). I think that most people today are leery of security and privacy because there have been so many high profile and public breaches and violations. There's a lot of concern about who's selling data to whom and what type of data is actually protected on individuals. This is much, much broader than healthcare.

    The fact that a large chunk of people would like to share information that they're tracking about themselves, they'd like to share that information with their providers is something that, as a health system, I think we need to find a way to integrate that one way or the other.

    The data in the infographic also shows trends that innovators and vendors should enable and capitalize upon. First, creating ways for consumers to easily collect and combine information about their activity and daily routine is incredibly valuable. There are countless sensors and apps so this is a crowded space to jump into. Second, creating tools that leverage that data to provide intelligent feedback to individuals is needed. This is an area that more companies are trying to get into, but is still pretty open. Third, enabling the easy sharing of personal data while maintaining the privacy and security of that data is essential to consumer trust and health system buy-in. This is harder, and there is still much to be figured out. Where is data going? Is it using traditional interfaces or [new EHR APIs](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-fuels-transformation-at-hospitals/)? How is it secured and can it pass the compliance officer? And fourth, though this is implied in 1 through 3 above, would be standardizing the data formats to make it easier for data to be exchanged. So many opportunities....

  :post: "I like to ask people from health systems, most of them from the IT side,
    about their patient engagement or digital engagement strategy. It’s interesting
    to hear how systems think about digital engagement considering the buzz and hype
    it is getting from vendors and pundits.\n\nMy unscientific opinion is that very
    few systems have anything resembling a patient engagement strategy. Despite getting
    so much attention, most healthcare delivery organizations aren’t preparing for
    patient engagement.\n\nA typical conversation I have with somebody in an IT group
    goes a bit like this:\n\n**Me:** “How are you thinking about patient engagement
    tools and strategies, either in place today or planned for the future?”\n\n**Response:**
    “MyChart is our patient engagement tool.” (or some variation of that statement)
    \n\n**Me:** “Are you using other mobile apps or technologies to connect with patients
    for communication, education, or self management?”\n\n**Response:** “Well, there
    have been a couple of small initiatives. For the most part, we use MyChart.” \n\n**Me:**
    “How do patients use MyChart?”\n\nWe now live in such an Epic-centric world that
    Epic is synonymous with EHR and MyChart is synonymous with PHR. More surprisingly
    to me is that MyChart is also now synonymous with patient engagement.\n\nThe systems
    I’m talking to are larger systems, so it’s not surprising to see Epic. I’ve had
    similar conversations with non-Epic systems and those usually just conclude with,
    “We’ve tried a couple of things for patients, but nothing at scale.”\n\nMy sense
    is that the root of the problem with patient engagement has two parts. The first
    problem is the lack of definition around patient engagement. There have been efforts
    to *define and standardize patient engagement*, but I don’t know many systems
    that have adopted a framework around it. Lack of definition makes it hard to create
    and implement a strategy.\n\nThe second problem is that most systems, especially
    IT groups within those systems, are drowning in other projects such as EHR implementations.
    For health systems, patient engagement still has an unclear ROI. With limited
    resources (“our group is fully booked for the next 12 to 18 months”), it’s hard
    to justify assigning labor and capital to projects that won’t deliver immediate
    value.\n\nI was telling a friend (and former Epic employee) about what I’ve been
    seeing with patient engagement, specifically MyChart. His response was, “Give
    them two years. When they see the timelines for some of the desired features,
    they’ll be out of the honeymoon phase and be looking for new ways to do things”.\n\nThat
    might be the case, but there are systems outside the honeymoon phase implementing
    Epic or other EHR. I’m curious what, if anything, those systems are doing with
    patient engagement.\n\nLacking definition and clear ROI, using the PHR solution
    of Epic or other EHR vendor for patient engagement makes sense. Looking at patient
    engagement broadly and defining it as people being more actively involved in their
    health and wellness, an EHR vendor won’t succeed in building a “one size fits
    all” solution.\n\nThis is not a knock against the EHR vendors or a reference to
    the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of their products. I just don’t think one
    solution, built by any organization or developer, will ever have the flexibility
    and features needed to meet the hype of patient engagement. MyChart and other
    provider-based PHRs are a stopgap solution that have a lot of adoption because
    they are bundled with EHRs.\n\nWhere does that leave all of the developers and
    startups that are building technology to engage patients? One of the major challenges
    for them is overcoming the stopgap PHR objections from enterprises. They can certainly
    go directly to consumers, and many of them are. The data silos opening up are
    helping those engagement startups populate their apps without having to rely on
    manual entry. \n\nIt’s easier to get patients to adopt something when the provider
    and health system buy in. That’s why MyChart is the most popular PHR. But is MyChart
    what people want, or rather is it what people get?\n"

  :summary: Who is buying patient engagement and implementing it? Hospitals. Health
    system leaders are starting venture funds and are cashing out on recapitalization.
  :blog_lead: 'Back in 2013, I wrote an [article](http://histalkmobile.com/whos-buying-engagement/)
    exploring what the key stimulate for what is going to drive patient engagement
    funding and implementation, especially in the world of startups. Successful patient
    engagement holds the key to improve community health, reduce costs, and make a
    more positive healthcare experience but effectively scaling this has been a challenge
    since startups are unable to stay lucrative when going direct to consumer markets.
    So many companies, like Jiff and Keas, start out with an engagement focus and
    end up molding into what drives profit, which typically is on the employer side
    of patient engagement as the ROI is more evident and incentives are easier to
    align.

'
  :post: "Fast forward to present day and the answer to who exactly is buying patient
    engagement and implementing it may finally be here — Hospitals. Health system
    leaders are starting venture funds and are cashing out on recapitalization because
    they truly understand healthcare. This approach is becoming more and more common
    among non-profit healthcare systems as getting in on the ground floor of new healthcare
    engagement technologies could result in some big payoffs as these funds give low
    bank interest rates and significant returns from securities. The most recent findings
    say that these fund leaders are tripling their investments over seven years. These
    investments by healthcare systems result in shortened sales cycles for patient
    engagement products and technologies by creating immediate customers. \n\nGiven
    that recent legislation is mandating hospitals to push towards value and quality
    of patient care, a growing number of hospitals are aiming to select a vendor/approach
    this year, so don’t be surprised when many healthcare systems turn into venture
    capital healthcare systems. C-Level executives and management will reap the monetary
    benefits but so will healthcare overall. A more engaged patient populace has only
    positive results forecasted. It’s an exciting day in healthcare.\n\nStay tuned
    throughout August as we continue to celebrate patient engagement. Want to know
    how we were able to help the Department of Veterans Affairs engage their patients
    and reach their goals? Read our [case study](/customer/veterans-affairs/)."
