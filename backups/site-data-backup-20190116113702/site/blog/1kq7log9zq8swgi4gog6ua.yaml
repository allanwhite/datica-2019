  Metabahn and HealthLoop are two vastly different companies that have the Datica common denominator. On one side, we have Metabahn, an Alabama-based agency of developers and designers determined to bring open source tools to healthcare. On the other, HealthLoop, a Mountain View, Calif. based health IT company that keeps doctors, patients and caregivers connected between visits with insightful, actionable and engaging information delivered via a cloud-based platform that automates follow-up care.

  **We are proud to establish partnerships with both of these companies and are even prouder that they chose us in opposition to many alternatives the marketplace has to offer. For them, it was a no-brainer. Don't take our word for it though. Read about their perspective in our recently released case studies on both companies.**

  Why now? Because there's no better time than now.

  **Have questions? Tell us what you need to know and our team of experts will be your sherpa. We believe in an improved healthcare and will do whatever it takes to make that a reality.
