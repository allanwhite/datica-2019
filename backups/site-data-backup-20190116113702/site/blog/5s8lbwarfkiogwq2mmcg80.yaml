:summary: HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. To make compliance
  easier for companies working with PHI, we open source our HIPAA policies.
:blog_lead: 'Today is a big day for us, and for those businesses striving for HIPAA
  compliance. [Starting today, we are open sourcing all our company policies.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)
  Are you a company who handles PHI and trying to achieve HIPAA compliance? Then you''ll
  find what we are about to share compelling and useful.

'
:post: |
  Achieving [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) generally has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Encryption, logging, monitoring, backup—these are just a few examples. Since the beginning, Datica has worked every day to take on these technical burdens for our customers.

  The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities, and these are where _your_ company policies come into play. Non-technical guidelines include signing [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), risk management procedures, and policies for training, among many other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

  When we were creating our policies, we found several templates for healthcare providers, but nothing for modern health technology companies. We spent a vast amount of time and effort writing our policies, then adapting them to meet the demands of external audits. We don't want people to reinvent the wheel; trust us, it's not fun. We also feel a broader community can improve these polices over time, making them better for everybody.

  By open sourcing our own company policies, we hope other healthcare companies will benefit. It aligns with our company mission: to help you focus on fixing healthcare without spending all of your time on HIPAA.

  The policies are hosted on GitHub, the premier public platform for open-sourced content. [To read more, head over to the project's homepage.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)

  :summary: Simply put, a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) defines responsibility,
    and thus liability, with respect to the handling of PHI data.
  :blog_lead: 'HIPAA guidelines define the safeguards for protected health information
    (PHI). Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) are contracts that outline how different
    organizations will handle electronic protected health information (ePHI) and the
    types of responsibilities that each organization assumes.  Simply put, a BAA defines
    responsibility, and thus liability, with respect to the handling of PHI data.

'
  :post: "We've written about [BAAs before](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    Start there for a general understanding. The rest of this article, as well as
    a [Part 2 that talks about the top 5 things to look for in a business associate
    agreement](https://datica.com/blog/top-5-things-you-find-in-an-ideal-business-associate-agreement/),
    will dive into why selecting a BAA is important, and give guidance when doing
    so.\n\n## It's not just a checkbox\n\n>   A chain is only as strong as its weakest
    link.\n>   —  A wise engineer\n\nDatica has talked to many companies about their
    HIPAA compliant hosting requirements and how our Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
    can address their requirements. Our mission is to help them get most of the way
    down the road of [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Often we discuss the topic of other vendors in the space, both similar HIPAA-compliant
    platforms or traditional companies like AWS, Firehost, Bluebox, etc. While the
    conversion usually focuses on technology and features, we emphasize the differences
    in our business associate agreements as well, because, in some ways, it is our
    best feature. With Datica, you sign one BAA to cover the entire compliance spectrum.\n\nUnlike
    several others, we do not require a non-disclosure agreement (NDAs) to view our
    BAA. In fact, it's [publicly available](https://policy.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa)
    as a part of our [open-sourced policies](https://catalyzeio.github.io/policies);
    we often encourage newer companies to use the business associate agreement template
    as a starting point for their own BAA. We specifically set aside time with new
    customers to explain what it covers and what is doesn't and why.\n\nIt is very
    important you read the language in the BAA from your vendor and understand it
    well. While it might seem the thought \"I have a BAA with my vendor\" is sufficient,
    the reality is when a breach or any other kind of security incident happens, you're
    at risk for whatever was declared in your BAA. In many ways a BAA is a mechanism
    for transferring risk (and thus liability) from one entity to another by having
    each entity acknowledging their responsibility in managing specific aspects of
    the legal mandates. \n\n## Briefly, how a business associate agreement works\n\nBusiness
    associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new
    HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon the definition of _business
    associate_ to include something called subcontractors. _Subcontractors_ are typically
    service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business
    associates, which are providing services for the covered entities.\n\nThe effect
    has been increased chaining of responsibilities—a good thing in today's technology
    landscape. As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos,
    more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, [considered
    subcontractors](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
    These _subcontractors_ (e.g. Datica, AWS) sign BAAs with _business associates_
    (you), who in turn sign a BAA with _covered entities_ (health system, health plan).\n\nIt
    is critical for you to remember that ultimately you, as the business associate
    signing a contract with a covered entity, are the one left holding the ball. It
    is your responsibility to ensure the following:\n\n- **Know your BAAs.** Since
    a chain of entities (like IaaS / hosting providers, APIs and SaaS) touch the ePHI,
    each must have BAAs in place with you that are consistent and not contradictory.
    For example, a business associate selling to Hospital ABC can't agree to a 24-hour
    breach notification policy if the hosting provider has a physical breach notification
    policy of 2 months.\n- **Meet your responsibilities.** If all the hosting provider
    gives you is VMs and VPN access, you are now responsible for everything else HIPAA
    demands. We're talking about encryption at-rest or in-transit (even within your
    dedicated environment), dedicated logging, and so on. Know what HIPAA requires
    and what you're left having to take care of yourself!\n\n## The takeaway\n\nThat
    leaves you with an intriguing proposition. By choosing Datica, you only ever have
    to sign one BAA. Never will you have to worry about lining up consistency with
    multiple vendors, or dreading the anxiety of gaps not covered.\n\nIn our next
    article, we will take a look at the top things you should look for in a BAA. If
    you have any BAA questions, feel free to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com),
    we're always happy to help.\n\n"

    open source contributions as a necessary activity of being a technology company.
    Contributing to open source projects and freely publishing tools we''ve built
    is what drives a lot of the work we do. This also allows us to stick to our ideals

'
  :post: |+
    As you navigate the page you'll see we've split our work into two main sections: docs and code. Our docs projects are geared towards policy and HIPAA related documentation. These are intended to help healthcare startups build a base of knowledge for their future audits. Other docs projects include FAQs and Guides for Datica Products. Our code projects are intended to help developers build applications. These include sample apps, SDKS and our platform command line tool.

    When we first set out to write many of these open source documents we found that little-to-no examples existed. Where were all the policy guides and outlines for how a modern healthcare startup might comply with HIPAA? Where were the HIPAA mappings and explanations of the law? Unfortunately they didn't exist. Up until now no one has published any documentation or outline of these docs. At Datica, we intend to change that. A big part of who we are is allowing the healthcare technology community to grow for the better. It's not just in the tools we build that enable any developer to build a compliant application, but in everything we do as a team.

    What's next? We have plans to grow the policy and documentation projects. Keep an eye out for additions there. On the technical side, we have worked extensively with Docker containers and plan to investigate open sourcing some work in this realm. Docker is a critical component to our business. Without it, serving our customers with a world-class [compliant platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) would be considerably harder, if not impossible. We want to give back to this Docker community in the future.

    If you're interested in working on open source projects and do truly meaningful work we encourage you to apply for any of the jobs listed on our [careers page](https://datica.com/careers/). If there are any questions you have about our open source projects or jobs please don't hesitate to email us at [hello@datica.com](mailto:hello@datica.com).

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
