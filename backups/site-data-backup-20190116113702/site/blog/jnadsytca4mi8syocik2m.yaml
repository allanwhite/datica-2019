:summary: The path toward becoming Datica's new Chief Technology Officer and Chief
  Security Officer involved many twists and turns for Christopher Gerg.
:blog_lead: The path toward Chief Technology Officer and even Chief Security Officer
  involves many twists and turns for those selected. As we see below, Christopher
  Gerg’s path also fits this winding route that leads some individuals to pursue one
  or more of the most important roles within a healthcare technology company. We’re
  honored that Chris has chosen Datica and wanted to share a small peek into his vast
  and interesting background.
:post: "\nBefore becoming specialized in information security, Chris Gerg’s career
  follows this path: Technical Support, System Administrator, Network Engineer. Then,
  for three and a half years, he spends his time with a penetration testing team.
  While there, he learns how to both discover and exploit customer systems, networks,
  and data stores. For some who find breaking in and discovering the vulnerabilities
  within a companies’ digital walls, the challenge is exhilarating. But for Chris,
  this work provides only frustration as he starts seeing how many environments are
  left unsecured and exploitable.\n\nIn an effort to help, he begins learning how
  to protect networks and detect signs of attempted attack. As an attacker himself,
  Chris holds great insight into how it works: he goes on to learn how to lock down
  systems and reduce the “attack surface” of a system and network.\n\nOver the years
  as a network security architect, manager, assessor, [compliance expert](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)
  in PCI-DSS, and eventually CISO, Chris says some foundational elements of information
  security became apparent — “a real, implemented plan (even if lean) is always better
  than relying upon some document that remains always under development.”\n\nAfter
  spending seven years directing corporate information security at Trustwave, a company
  that provides threat, vulnerability and compliance management services and technologies
  for more than three million business customers in 96 countries, Chris sidesteps
  into the field of healthcare technology. As Chief Security Officer and VP of Infrastructure
  and Engineering for HealthGrades, Chris sees first-hand the rocky path toward [digital
  health success](https://datica.com/dhsf/) when companies are placed under such heavy
  regulatory obligations. \n\n> Meeting these obligations is difficult and expensive
  for most organizations or becomes an exercise in tackling only the highest risk
  issues.”   \n\nIn [today’s press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/02/prweb15217999.htm
  ), you can learn more about Chris’ background and his views on how companies can
  address the foundational elements first in the effort to secure their networks.\n\n##
  Road Begins and Leads Back to Wisconsin\n\nWith parents born and raised in Beaver
  Dam, Wisconsin, it’s not surprising that Chris would eventually find his way back
  to the badger state, even though he was born in Omaha, Nebraska (Offutt AFB). His
  dad, a 20-year Air Force veteran, took on several tours of Vietnam, with work in
  a missile silo, the backseat of RF-4 phantoms doing tactical reconnaissance, and
  working with spy planes (primarily the U-2/TR-1 and SR 71), and satellites doing
  photo processing for strategic reconnaissance. Due to his father’s military career,
  Chris attended seven different schools all over the world. “I could have ended up
  a wallflower (shy and reserved) or a smart ass,” says Chris, “guess which path I
  took?”\n\nBy middle school, the Gergs settled back in Sun Prairie, Wisc. when his
  father retired from military service. Chris eventually chose the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater
  for his college education for which he paid himself. During the break between the
  start of his last semester of college, Microsoft hired him for technical support
  during the launch of Windows 95, which wound up being the start of his career.  Fortunately
  for Datica, Chris chose Wisconsin as his base of operations through most of his
  career. “Wisconsin feels uncrowded, educated, and civilized, but one can still get
  out in nature,” says Chris, who spends most of his free time hiking, backpacking
  and honing up on his nature photography skills.\n\n## From Authorship to Alpacas\n\nDuring
  his career low point as a penetration tester, he grew concerned about the endgame.
  Fortunately for Chris, someone he admired gave him some good advice: Make a one
  year, three year, and five-year plan — not too detailed, because you might miss
  something. So Chris made his plan, which included two goals, 1) be published in
  a trade journal/magazine within six months, and 2) write a book/technical manual
  within five years. Using a visualization method for those goals, six months later
  Chris had been published in two journals and had signed a contract with O’Reilly
  and Associates to write, [“Managing Security with Snort & IDS Tools: Intrusion Detection
  with Open Source Tools.”](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Security-Snort-IDS-Tools/dp/0596006616/ref=pd_sbs_14_1)\n\nYou
  need only look to Chris’ book biography to understand his wicked sense of humor.
  According to the bio, it says that he spends his free time raising rugged mountain
  alpacas in the windswept peaks of south-central Wisconsin. Full disclosure: Not
  only are there no wind-swept peaks in south-central Wisconsin, but Chris has never
  owned an alpaca.  At the prodding of friends, who swore no one ever reads an author’s
  bio, he decided to write something off the wall to see who indeed does read an author’s
  bio.\n\n## Why Datica?\n\nThroughout his career, Chris’ main goal has been to do
  interesting things and work with people he likes and respects. His consulting work
  took him from place to place, helping organizations get ready for compliance obligations,
  mature existing information security, risk management, compliance, privacy, and/or
  internal audit practices (or help build one from scratch.) He says, however, I missed
  being part of a team and developing a feeling of ‘ownership’ for the work product
  of that team. Datica provides an opportunity for a kid who took the vacuum cleaner
  apart at age 8 to see how it worked and a chance to be part of building something
  cool.”\n\nChris chose Datica due to its interesting alignment with his career background
  in compliance, information security, [cloud infrastructure for healthcare](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/)
  and “foundational” best practices in IT. \n\n> Building security in from the start
  instead of ‘bolting it on later’ is a recurring theme for me and Datica,” Chris
  says. “Building a platform that does all those foundational things that are not
  a core competency for the customer is a huge deal.”\n\n\n"

  :summary: 'One thing is certain: healthcare still has a security problem. Out of
    295 breaches reported so far for 2017, 132 are hacking/IT incident breaches.'
  :blog_lead: "The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil
    Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information.
    The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the
    [HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html
    ). \n\nBecause entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report
    it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However,
    a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be
    instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent [penalties of GDPR](https://datica.com/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)
    coming in May of 2018. "
  :post: "## HIPAA Security is still a problem\n\nOne thing is certain: healthcare
    [still has a security problem](https://datica.com/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
    The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT
    incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
    2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg\"
    alt=\"2017 Data Breaches by Type\">\n\nOne of the largest, which occurred at Airway
    Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in
    a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and
    reported the breach to HHS in June. \n\nAccording to [a story about the Airway
    Oxygen breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier)
    in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed
    an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and
    applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed
    monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a
    cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.
    \n\nThe story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all
    of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s
    no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking. \n\n##
    Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers\n\nAnother interesting
    thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities
    reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered
    security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies,
    and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches
    as well. \n\nLate in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, [MongoDB databases
    fell victim to ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html)
    attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due
    to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice)
    that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special
    hacking tool.” \n\nMongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software,
    but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September
    2017, as many as 26,000 [databases were hijacked and held for ransom](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find).
    Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in
    the attacks, along with other entities. \n\n## Lessons from others’ mistakes\n\nOn
    December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st
    Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
    (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI)
    was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals. \n\nThe FBI found that
    the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server.
    As many as 2.2 million people were affected. \n\nThe settlement was for 21CO to
    pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to
    an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein & Lehr LLP,\nthe results
    of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into [what all healthcare
    entities should be doing](https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement):
    \n\n> The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate
    and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI);
    (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and
    vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement
    procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and,
    (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate
    without having written business associate agreement in place.” \n\nThe CAP that
    21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising
    security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements,
    among several other steps. \n\nSaul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr offer advice to other
    business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing, \n\n> As we begin
    2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy,
    Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance
    and make timely adjustments as appropriate.” \n\nAs we move through 2018 and toward
    May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves
    us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not
    only with HIPAA, but also [with GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). After
    all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that
    amount in GDPR fines.\n\nLet Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for
    your digital health application with our HITRUST-certified healthcare platform.

  :summary: 'Datica''s Winter 2017 quarterly industry report examines the paradox
    of shadow IT in healthcare. Is it a security threat or enabler for innovation? '
  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica.com/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica.com/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica.com/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica.com/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica.com/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

  :summary: HITRUST is a superset security framework and understanding both the advantages
    and disadvantages of this will help you wield HITRUST successfully.
  :blog_lead: One big reason HITRUST is taken so seriously is how it is composed of
    a long list of other security and risk management frameworks. HITRUST is a superset
    security framework and understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of
    this point goes a long way in understanding how to wield HITRUST successfully.
  :post: "The HITRUST Alliance purposefully took the best parts of past frameworks
    to mold its \"Common Security Framework\" or CSF. The [HITRUST CSF](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    is then a list of more than seven hundred controls with the best parts of PCI,
    NIST, and more in mind. Let's walk through the composite list.\n\n## The HITRUST
    list\n\nIn HITRUST's official introduction, it lists out the sources of influence:\n\n*
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Principles
    and Criteria\n* Catalog of Minimum Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-E)
    – Exchange Reference Architecture (ERA) Supplement v2\n* Center for Internet Security
    (CIS) Critical Security Controls v6\n* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) Omnibus Final Rule\n* IRS Publication 1075, Tax Information Security
    Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies: Safeguards for Protecting Federal
    Tax Returns and Return Information (New)\n* ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Information Technology—Security
    Techniques—Information Security Management Systems Requirements\n* ISO/IEC 27002:2013,
    Information Technology—Security Techniques—Code of Practice for Information Security
    Controls\n* ISO/IEC 27799:2008 Health Informatics (guidance for information security
    management for healthcare organizations using ISO/IEC 27002:2005)\n* National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)\n*
    NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity v1\n* Control
    Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT) v4.1\n* Payment Card
    Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard v3.2\n* Federal privacy requirements (e.g.,
    HHS)\n* State security requirements (e.g., Nevada, Massachusetts, and Texas)\n*
    Experiences and best practices of HITRUST participants\n\n## The positives and
    negatives of HITRUST CSF certification\n\nThere are positives and negatives to
    thinking about [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) as a superset framework.\n\nFirst,
    the main negative: If you become HITRUST CSF Certified, you are **not** certified
    or compliant with the above list. If you want to be SOC2 certified or PCI compliant,
    you must still conduct those assessments independently with your auditor. If your
    business is such where it's mandatory you provide those defined assurances, it
    means you have other audits to manage and pay for. That can be frustrating.\n\nBut
    there are many positives to HITRUST's superset nature. The biggest is the credibility
    and thoroughness attributed to a certification. Most compliance and security officers
    at covered entities are adopting HITRUST as the best and only required way to
    assess business associates because they know if someone is HITRUST CSF Certified,
    they have gone through a thorough process to prove assurances.\n\nThe other positive
    is the overall reduction in cost for your company to prove security and compliance.
    Again, within the framing that it's not necessarily a hard requirement to show
    PCI compliance, et al, your organization can effectively demonstrate credibility
    within those 14 frameworks in a one-time shot. We've written a case study about
    [our own HITRUST certification costs](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/),
    which average somewhere around $20,000-$60,000 depending on scope.\n\nIf you are
    working on a project which requires compliance and are looking into HITRUST, consider
    us a resource. We'd be happy to chat more about the benefits of HITRUST on the
    cloud. \n\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica.com/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
