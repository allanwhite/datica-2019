:summary: As we roll into the end of 2017, it's worth looking back on how the industry
  has been doing protecting PHI against the threat of cyber-intrusions.
:blog_lead: 'As we roll into the last few months of the year, it''s worth looking
  back on how the industry has been doing protecting PHI and adapting to the increasingly
  threatening world of cyber-intrusions. While the big stories generally revolve around
  the largest amount of lives impacted and the most technically harrowing attacks,
  it''s worth noting that there are still breaches as simple as someone stealing a
  laptop with a spreadsheets with thousands of persons worth of PHI on it. In this
  article, we''re going to go through some of the largest breaches of 2017 and discuss
  how we address these as a company which we''ve shared in our open-source policies.
  While it''s impossible to say in retrospect if any breach was 100% preventable,
  having policies in place to provide "reasonable effort" to prevent exposure is key
  to minimizing the damage from the unpreventable. '
:post: "## Ransomware or Malware\n\nAt top of mind in 2017 is ransomware and malware,
  which shut down and exposed multiple hospitals and HIT Vendors thoughout the year.
  Of those, two were notable:\n\n-  [Pacific Alliance Medical Center attack potentially
  leaks 260K patients](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/los-angeles-provider-breached-ransomware-attack-over-260000-patients-affected-updated)\n-
  \ [Nuance Impacted for Weeks Due to Malware](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cybersecurity/cyber-attack-update-nuance-still-down-researchers-believe-petya-not)\n\nThe
  vector of the attack is relatively straightforward: through phishing or infected
  3rd party hardware like a thumb drive, hackers gain access to hardware throughout
  an organization's network and encrypt data on that hardware. The purpose of ransomware
  is to extract payment to undo that encryption while other malware like the ones
  believed to be used in the Nuance attack are wholly irreversible and are just designed
  to effectively destroy the data.\n\nPreventing something like an attack like this
  actually hits to the heart of most of our policies, but let's go for the top 3 references
  in this article. First, [patch management](https://policy.datica.com/#9.5-patch-management-procedures)
  ensures that you are constantly being vigilant to new security concerns. While it's
  not directly stated in our policies, we have one person and a backup who are wholly
  responsible for managing patches for our system for security concerns. Second, having
  policies on [appropriate system access and by reducing the need for privledged users](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification)
  reduces the risk that if one user's credentials are compromised all systems could
  be accessible by an attacker. Third, we run [OSSEC and Anti-Virus](https://policy.datica.com/#17.4-prevention-of-malware-on-production-systems)
  on all production systems to identify any otherwise unknown attacks and to solve
  any issues brought up from an attack.\n\n## Unauthorized Access or Disclosure\n\n-
  [Indiana Medicaid warns patients of health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/indiana-medicaid-warns-patients-health-data-breach)\n-
  [Phishing attack at UC Davis leads to health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phishing-attack-uc-davis-health-breaches-data-15000-patients)\n\nOther
  than a vector for malware, [phishing](https://datica.com/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/)
  can also be used as a method for attackers to simply gain access to systems by getting
  credentials to a system. Or, a well-meaning dev may accidentally breach patient
  data by placing it on a public facing web page. \n\nWhile your mileage may vary,
  our policies have a few tips to help prevent this. First, we require [two-factor
  auth](https://policy.datica.com/#17.7-production-system-security) on all production
  systems. While this doesn't necessarily prevent a system user from giving an attacker
  their credentials *and* auth token (sigh), it reduces the risk of unauthorized cross
  application access and minimizes the window by which an attacker can maintain access
  to an application. We also require access to all production systems to be [managed
  over a VPN with two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
  We also have an unofficial \"All data is potentially PHI\" policy for our managed
  integration services hardware/software. While we may have access to test environments
  with mock patient data, we assume that we may be sent PHI from any vendor or healthcare
  organization. As such, we protect all data like PHI as established in our policies.
  \n\n## Theft or Improper Disposal\n\n- [WSU hard drive theft potentially impacts
  1 million people](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/wsu-hard-drive-theft-potentially-impacts-1-million-people)\n-
  [State Employee Dumps Medicaid Worksheets in dumpster](http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/state-employee-dumps-medicaid-worksheets-in-dumpster/article_13f36eb4-1fb4-5278-93e1-1d30a00c9f9a.html)\n\nWhile
  hackers and ransomeware are increasingly perilous, [20% of data breaches reported
  to the OCR are good old fashioned theft and improper disposal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
  Someone stealing a laptop from a car or a unencrypted hard drive from an office
  to cause a breach are a tale as old as HIPAA itself.\n\nWe may be biased, but **stop
  storing PHI on local machines or on paper**. [We don't](https://policy.datica.com/#7.13-access-to-ephi).
  We only used [approved tools](https://policy.datica.com/#20.-approved-tools-policy)
  with appropriate access controls and encryption to store and transfer PHI. We also
  have [no servers in our offices](https://policy.datica.com/#10.-facility-access-policy)
  and BAAs with our cloud providers. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon't [learn about HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
  the hard way, either getting beat up by your first 250-question audit or worse:
  by finding yourself on the OCR's Wall of Shame. Consult our policies or let us do
  the lifting for you on our thrice-audited, HITRUST-certified [compliant Platform](https://datica.com/platform/).

  :summary: In the 377 healthcare data breaches last year, phishing attacks were among
    the top data breach causes. Why is healthcare such a target for spear phishing
    attacks?
  :blog_lead: "At the beginning of August, the BBC reported that a UK-based “prankster”
    had successfully [spoofed the White House.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40788080)
    Through spear phishing emails, this bad actor had not only convinced a senior
    cyber security officer that he was the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor
    Jared Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus
    to fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory
    email exchanges. After posting a few of those emails on Twitter, the culprit promised
    not to do it again and urged the current administration to “tighten up IT policy.”
    While the jokester later indicated his email spoofing had no harmful intent, the
    implications go way beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n"
  :post: "Phishing is a widely used form of social engineering where malicious ne’re-do-wells
    broadcast  disguised emails to a large population in an attempt to steal sensitive
    information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
    not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with
    the term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America
    Online (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked
    themselves as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and
    Ebay. These fraudulent emails would often persuade victims to open a link with
    a malevolent attachment or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing
    scams bred a more targeted type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
    For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
    if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
    someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
    subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
    Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches
    last year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
    report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
    hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches.
    Furthermore, spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting
    CEOs. From 2015 to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent.
    In the first part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health,
    Torrance Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according
    to Healthcare IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so
    far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
    This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
    With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
    spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
    Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica
    Security Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear
    phishing: high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for
    ransomware and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security
    walls when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what
    they want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization,
    is also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing
    attempt that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one
    of our executive’s email addresses. He or she used that email address to request
    a wire transfer from the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the
    department head alerted the appropriate person within Datica about the email and
    its request, and ultimately averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example
    to warn its own customers to such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance
    Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare organizations can better protect themselves
    from such attacks. Her recommendations and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n###
    Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll employees need to be made aware of what
    phishing is and the damage that can result from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines
    the steps he uses to fully inform Datica employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing
    email looks like, explaining how to evaluate such an email and then confirming
    that employees know to whom suspicious emails should be forwarded for evaluation
    are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions that could breach an organization’s
    thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic testing of employees’ knowledge
    and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting internal spear phishing lures
    that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions against doing testing
    at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular that on October
    1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals. \n\n###
    Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in place
    as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is trying
    to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should have
    the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
    Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then
    managing any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program
    “Having zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational
    goal,” says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation
    steps.” \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in
    HITRUST. Datica joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States
    to achieve [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/)
    status and believes that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is
    the best way to protect its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity
    and compliance are deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica.com/).
    If you’ve ever had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment
    on the Datica platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of
    double verification. The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing
    department to quickly verify and make customer requested adjustments for access.
    Datica utilizes stringent measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers.
    These steps combined with the recommendations above better protect your organization
    for a spear phishing attack. \n"

  :summary: By now you've heard of the CloudFlare leak of sensitive data. There's
    a specific part of HIPAA legislation that health care should be concerned about.
  :blog_lead: |-
    By now you've likely heard of the [CloudFlare parser bug](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) that caused CloudFlare's CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, [a serious problem](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/834900838837411840), or [a historic event](https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/834905083976552449).

    At Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs) relate to maintaining [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/guide/hipaa/). Are you allowed to use them in a web application? If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?

    As it turns out there's a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly to these questions.
  :post: "## The Conduit Exception\n\n[We've written in the past](https://datica.com/academy/the-hipaa-privacy-rule/)
    how the [Omnibus rule for HIPAA](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),
    introduced in 2013, has affected companies doing business in the healthcare industry.
    One important clarification made in the Omnibus rule is additional guidance around
    what does and does not fall under HIPAA and the conduit exception.\n\nThe conduit
    exception was introduced for reasons of practicality. In effect, the exception
    states that no legal agreements are required between covered entities and organizations
    that merely act as \"conduits\" for ePHI.\n\nIn the physical world this makes
    a lot of sense. Without this exception it would be impossible for your doctor
    to discuss health issues over the phone or send medical bills over postal mail.\n\nThings
    become a little blurrier in the electronic world. What exactly is the difference
    between an organization/service acting as a conduit for information and an organization/service
    acting as a business associate?\n\nAccording to the [legal wording](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-01-25/pdf/2013-01073.pdf),\n\n>
    … data transmission organizations that do not require access to protected health
    information on a routine basis would not be treated as business associates. This
    is consistent with our prior interpretation of the definition of \"business associate,\"
    through which we have stated that entities that act as mere conduits for the transport
    of protected health information but do not access the information other than on
    a random or infrequent basis are not business associates.\n\nThis is further clarified
    with:\n\n> The conduit exception is a narrow one and is intended to exclude only
    those entities providing mere courier services, such as the U.S. Postal Service
    or United Parcel Service and their electronic equivalents, such as, internet service
    providers (ISPs) providing mere data transmission services. As we have stated
    in prior guidance, a conduit transports information but does not access it other
    than on a random or infrequent basis as necessary to perform the transportation
    service or as required by other law.\n\nSo the final rule clearly calls out ISPs
    as falling under the conduit exemption and that a \"random or infrequent basis\"
    is the dividing line. This is a logical extension of the physical examples given
    earlier.\n\n## Are CDNs Exempt?\n\nUnfortunately, the final rule does not cover
    CDN services explicitly. Let's consider some of the cases where using a CDN makes
    sense and map them to the guidelines above.\n\nOne typical use for CDNs is to
    place static content geographically closer to end users, for example, static HTML
    or Javascript libraries. These are obviously not ePHI but often fall under HIPAA
    for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, if you have a web application and are dynamically
    loading Javascript from a CDN, and if that CDN were ever compromised, any maliciously-injected
    code could feasibly be used to exfiltrate ePHI out of your application. If you're
    not cryptographically verifying the content downloaded from the CDN you are opening
    up yourself to attack vectors. In this case, the CDN would _definitely_ not be
    covered by the conduit exemption; after all, it is storing executable code on
    your behalf.\n\nAnother use involves using the CDN to proxy an application server,
    essentially acting as a global caching layer. Some CDNs claim that because they
    offer encryption support (HTTPS), and they are simply acting as a path for cached
    information, they are exempt under the conduit exception. Unfortunately this argument
    is invalid and falls apart under scrutiny.\n\nSome CDNs require you to upload
    a copy of your HTTPS certificate and private key in order to get HTTPS support.
    In this case, if that certificate is also used to protect ePHI, this is _definitely_
    not covered by the conduit exception. You are providing keying material that can
    be used to decrypt sensitive information. Not only would this fall under HIPAA
    legislation, this is bad security hygiene.\n\nEven if the CDN uses a separate
    HTTPS certificate and private key, if it is acting as a proxy in front of a health-related
    application the CDN's servers will likely receive, decrypt, and transmit ePHI.
    In contrast with an ISP the CDN will have access to ePHI on much more than a \"random
    or infrequent\" basis.\n\nAdditionally, simple metadata related to some websites
    may be sensitive. How would you feel if leaked HTTP request logs showed a username
    that corresponds with your Twitter handle visiting an intensely personal website
    such as [a disease-focused dating site](https://www.mpwh.com/)? Depending on what
    information is tracked in the request URLs, even web server access logs may inadvertently
    contain ePHI.\n\nOne can picture data centers full of HTTPS frontends silently
    processing data that may contain sensitive information. Given that the CDN staff
    has administrative access to those machines, how can you be sure any ePHI that
    happens to traverse through their network is being properly protected? What legal
    actions do you have in case it is not being handled correctly?\n\n## The Importance
    of the BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n\nThese issues were some of the key
    motivators for introducing the concept of the [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements),
    or BAA. In HIPAA, these legal agreements are used for a few important reasons:\n\n1.
    To clearly define expectations around how both parties follow HIPAA regulations,
    particularly around how data containing ePHI will be managed.\n2. To delineate
    the risks and responsibilities between both parties, particularly around breach
    notifications and penalties.\n\nWithout such a legal agreement in place allowing
    a third party to access data containing ePHI is a risky proposition. How will
    you know if data is being properly protected? If a security incident happens related
    to ePHI for your customers, how you will be notified so you can take appropriate
    actions?\n\nIf there is no agreement in place there is not a clear legal course
    of action to take in the event of a breach. In fact, given the way HIPAA regulations
    are enforced, without a BAA **you will be liable for any mistakes made by that
    third party.**\n\nThe fiscal repercussions of being on the hook for a breach caused
    by a third party is compelling enough for organizations to ensure that any services
    they use are covered under a BAA. But more importantly, the legal framework of
    the BAA means that you will have done at least a token amount of due diligence
    in protecting your customer's ePHI data. Allowing sensitive data to flow through
    a third party without such diligence is irresponsible and shows a complete lack
    of respect for your customer's basic privacy rights.\n\nOr as Gene Fry [summarized
    so succinctly](http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/hipaa-conduit-exception-rule/):\n\n>
    Any provider that states they are fully HIPAA compliant will sign a BAA with you,
    and if they don’t, you’re putting your organization and patients’ data at risk.\n\n##
    Impact of the CloudFlare Breach\n\nGiven the scale at which CloudFlare operates,
    the impact of this breach will likely take a long time to fully flesh out. While
    [CloudFlare reacted quickly to respond to this breach](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139)
    it will take some time to regain the trust they lost with this catastrophic mistake.\n\nTo
    the best of our knowledge CloudFlare has never offered a BAA for their customers,
    which means that any organization that used CloudFlare's CDN capabilities with
    ePHI needs to start invoking their breach procedures **now.** We hope all such
    organizations do the right thing and help protect any sensitive data entrusted
    to them by their customers.\n\n*Learn more about how [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud)

  :summary: This Q&A with Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, explores what
    it means that Datica just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies.
  :blog_lead: |-
    A week ago, Chief Data Officer [Mark Olschesky](https://datica.com/about/mark/) used Slack to announce that Datica had just passed 200 forks of our open-source policies. Of course, the company wise-crackers quickly posted the obligatory Yogi Berra response:

    > When you come to a fork in the road, take it!
  :post: "As with many technical terms, the word “fork” obviously had more than one
    meaning. The mention of this particular company achievement, along with its oddly
    referenced name suddenly had my non-technical mind driving for answers. I needed
    to uncover not only what a “fork” was, but also why having 200 of them came with
    so many “thumbs up” and “clapping hand” emoticons. The discovery called for a
    quick Q&A with none other than torchbearer himself, [Mark Olschesky](/about/mark/).
    \n\n#### Q: Just what is a “fork” in technical terms?\n\n**Mark:**  A fork is
    a term for duplicating a code or document repository. It’s not required. Someone
    could simply download the source from the repository without us knowing at all.
    In the open-source world, “forks” and “stars” are a common way to track the success
    of a project. We use [GitHub to host our policies](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies/);
    there, you can track all changes made to the policies by reviewing forks made
    by our customers.\n\n#### Q: Participating in open-source projects has been strategic
    for Datica, can you tell me more about its importance to the company?\n\n**Mark:**
    When the company was founded in 2013, the industry had its share of duplicitous
    vendors peddling “HIPAA-compliant” solutions for hosting and application development.
    Turns out that many of those solutions were far from compliant. As a company that,
    1) wanted to do more to make compliance in the cloud easier and, 2) was not the
    first HIPAA-compliant vendor, the company needed to go the extra mile to prove
    our compliance and differentiate the company from the rest of the market beyond
    base market copy.\n\n#### Q: How did that differentiation begin?\n\n**Mark:**
    During Datica’s first HITRUST audit, CEO Travis Good, MD saw the potential for
    sharing what we’d learned with the entire industry via open-source policies. He
    then made the following strategic decisions:\n\n- Datica should publish our policies
    in a way that allows them to be easily tracked over time (GitHub).\n- We should
    open-source the policies to both engender goodwill with the developer community
    and to also demonstrate the lengths that Datica goes for its customers versus
    other “HIPAA-compliant” vendors. \n- Provide a way for other companies with existing
    infrastructure or that didn’t want to host with Datica to fork those policies
    and make them their own. As such, we would show different flavors of how to demonstrate
    compliance with different application stacks or organizational differences.\n\n####
    Q: How does forking of our open-source policies help healthcare in general?\n\n**Mark:**
    As a company, Datica does not manage all the parts of HIPAA. For example, we don’t
    employ clinicians or have software that performs medical decision-making or automated
    outreach to patients. As such, it’s hard for our policies to be the definitive
    guide for “what it means to be HIPAA compliant.”\n\n#### Q: That sounds counterintuitive
    to the ultimate goal of HIPAA compliance. Can you explain how forks play into
    that?\n\n**Mark:** By looking at forks, you can see what other customers have
    done. Most commonly, you can see companies with different Business Associate Agreements
    (BAAs). You’ll also see some major material differences through the forks. \n\n####
    Q: Can you give me a good example of a fork?\n\n**Mark:** One is Bind. As an insurer/broker
    (and therefore likely a [Covered Entity](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    their policies will differ from Datica’s as a cloud infrastructure/tooling provider.
    Bind’s willingness to share what they’ve done could help other insurers or brokers
    with their path to build and demonstrate compliance. That can save everyone time
    and money. That savings allows organizations to work on the real problems in healthcare.\n\n####
    Q: When the 200th fork came in from the Chief Technology Officer of a care coordination
    platform, you shared this good news with the entire company. Why was this an important
    achievement?\n\n**Mark:** Many open-source projects don’t receive much attention,
    so it’s great to see that Datica’s open-sourced policies are one of the more popular
    open source projects in healthcare compliance. The Linux Foundation took a similar
    approach a year later in [publishing their policies](https://github.com/lfit/itpol).
    Datica is proud to be one of the earlier innovators in a space that facilitates
    transparency in best practices by publishing those policies. As a company we strive
    to constantly do what’s best for our customers, but also the industry as a whole.\n"

  :summary: HIPAA compliance is complicated, but it doesn't have to be. To make compliance
    easier for companies working with PHI, we open source our HIPAA policies.
  :blog_lead: 'Today is a big day for us, and for those businesses striving for HIPAA
    compliance. [Starting today, we are open sourcing all our company policies.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)
    Are you a company who handles PHI and trying to achieve HIPAA compliance? Then
    you''ll find what we are about to share compelling and useful.

'
  :post: |
    Achieving [HIPAA compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) generally has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Encryption, logging, monitoring, backup—these are just a few examples. Since the beginning, Datica has worked every day to take on these technical burdens for our customers.

    The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities, and these are where _your_ company policies come into play. Non-technical guidelines include signing [Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), risk management procedures, and policies for training, among many other things. Crafting company policies that align with HIPAA administrative guidelines are straightforward, but an immense burden.

    When we were creating our policies, we found several templates for healthcare providers, but nothing for modern health technology companies. We spent a vast amount of time and effort writing our policies, then adapting them to meet the demands of external audits. We don't want people to reinvent the wheel; trust us, it's not fun. We also feel a broader community can improve these polices over time, making them better for everybody.

    By open sourcing our own company policies, we hope other healthcare companies will benefit. It aligns with our company mission: to help you focus on fixing healthcare without spending all of your time on HIPAA.

    The policies are hosted on GitHub, the premier public platform for open-sourced content. [To read more, head over to the project's homepage.](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/)

    Let us know if you find these useful!

  :summary: We've taken our commitment to open source and Kubernetes a step further
    by becoming a silver member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
  :blog_lead: As any of the 200+ people who have already forked Datica’s open source
    compliance policies can attest, we’ve always been a big believer in the value
    and spirit of open source. Last year our open source commitment evolved to include
    [Open Source Connectors](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)
    to help solve the problem of healthcare data integration. Most recently, the open
    source project [Kubernetes&reg;](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/)
    became the fundamental technical management layer for Datica. To take this commitment
    even further, we’re thrilled to announce we’ve become one of the newest silver
    members of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF),
    home of Kubernetes.
  :post: "  \nSince 2015, Kubernetes has become the industry standard for container
    management, lending the best tools for workload deployment on public clouds. In
    addition to being cross-cloud compatible and open source, the CNCF Kubernetes
    project and community have grown at a tremendous pace. In fact, the [CNCF announced
    Datica as one of it’s 19 newest members](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-reaches-236-members-including-54-end-users-300671019.html)
    last week, bringing the membership level to 236 companies. What really makes [Kubernetes
    a viable option](https://datica.com/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) is not the core
    project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround it.\n\nWe’re
    excited for what the future holds in this open-source-fueled era of rapid development
    and are particular excited to step into this future in partnership with the CNCF
    to collaborate with other Kubernetes developers who are trying to build secure
    and compliant products. \n\nTake a look at the [press release announcing our CNCF

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
