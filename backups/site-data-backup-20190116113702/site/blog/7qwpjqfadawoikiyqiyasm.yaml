  from Medicare. The media is running with stories, and the press is not good for
  doctors. A small subset of doctors account for a large percentage of overall Medicare
  payments, but I think the overall impression the public is getting is that doctors
  bill Medicare a lot for their services. While there are definitely some bad apples,
  overall most doctors are not abusing the system.

  There are lots of variables that determine how physicians bill. One, relevant to this data, is the percent of patients in a practice that are on Medicare. It's hard to compare a practice with 20% Medicare patients to a practice with 80% Medicare patients.

  Another variable is the amount of expensive medications used in outpatient settings. Some specialties, like ophthalmology and oncology-related specialties, use a lot of these expensive medications. These specialties, not surprisingly, happen to be the top 4 specialties that [bill](http://www.marketplace.org/topics/health-care/these-are-highest-paid-doctors-medicare) Medicare over $3 million a year. Because of this, they bill a lot, but much of what they bill is a direct pass through to the drug companies that make the drugs they are using. The Wall Street Journal did a good job with this graphic that shows the percent of billing that is actually expenses.

  Taking the above graphic, which clearly shows that lots of what is billed to Medicare by providers is actually pass through for expenses like drugs, and combining it with the fact that this new billing data, in aggregate (kept by doc and passed through), is only about 13% of total Medicare spending, shines a new light on how to look at this data.

  Let's look at a specific example specialty, ophthalmology, and a specific condition, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Two commonly used drugs for AMD, both injected in an outpatient setting, are Lucentis and Avastin. I worked on a couple of studies, this one getting [published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702430), looking at Lucentis vs Avastin. The drugs are extremely similar, and made by the same company (currently Roche, formerly Genentech until Roche acquired it). Both drugs inhibit a growth factor of vascular tissue, preventing the proliferation of blood vessels at the back of the eye (blood is wet, that's why it's call wet AMD). Lucentis, I hope I'm remember this correctly from med school, was a reformulation of Avastin with smaller particle size (smaller particles have less risk of blocking the small drainage system in the eye) and is approved by the FDA for web AMD. Avastin is not approved by the FDA for wet AMD but is sometimes used for it because it is so much cheaper. The cost difference 6 years ago was $2300 for Lucentis vs $50 for Avastin. Ophthalmologist make more on Lucentis and frequently use it, with some patients injecting every 4-8 weeks. But the vast majority of that $2300 for Lucentis that is billed to Medicare is passed on directly to Roche. Roche sold $1.9 billion of Lucentis last year, which is revenue growth of 13%; Roche also sold $6.5 billion worth of Avastin, which is used for different kinds of cancer.

  The point is only that healthcare is exceptionally expensive, and doctors are not collecting the majority of it, or even collecting the majority of what they bill sometimes. Medical billing is exceptionally complex, and varies a lot from setting to setting (inpatient, outpatient, private pay, public pay, concierge, etc). It's hard to wrap your head around if you've never done it or been exposed to it first hand. I've done work in the past with private practices (including ophto), and most recently with my wife's practice, on billing issues, so I have experience on the outpatient side of billing.

  The system is setup to be complex. And it's only getting worse with ICD-10. Today, providers will usually bill multiple codes per patient visit. It's usually an office visit code (which can be a new or existing patient and can be at different levels depending on complexity - time spent, questions asked, etc) + some type of procedure (biopsy, for example) or order code (lab test, for example). That's an easy example, they get a lot more complex. You can see if you look at the newly released provider data that Medicare only pays $3-5 for some of those add-on visit codes. Does it really seem like a good use of time to have docs, and billers, hitting all these extra codes to collect little bits here and there? It's like a game, and it's easily manipulated even while staying within the rules. It's ripe for fraud, and error, and hopefully that's more of the message with this data release than anything else. Aspects of billing and reimbursement are [changing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/changing-reimbursement-means-new-opportunities/), but it's slow and not widespread.

  :summary: 'Mobile health, or mHealth, isn''t a panacea, but it is a catalyst for
    new processes, workflows, data collections, and ultimately care, whether that''s
    self care or clinician-provided care. '
  :blog_lead: 'Health technology is hot. Entrepreneurs are flocking to it and it''s
    becoming a lot more attractive to [investors](http://rockhealth.com/2014/01/2013-digital-health-funding-report/).
    A big area of interest, one we are betting on as well, is the power of mobile
    technology to reshape all aspects of healthcare. Mobile health, or mHealth, isn''t
    a panacea, but it is a catalyst for new processes, workflows, data collections,
    and ultimately care, whether that''s self care or clinician-provided care. When
    we say "mHealth", we''re speaking to more than apps but also sensors, messaging
    services, and other connected devices.

  :post: |+
    What are the hurdles for mobile health? It's healthcare, a highly regulated industry with payment complexity that's hard to fathom. Lots of people, and [studies](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2014/03/12%20mhealth%20china%20united%20states%20health%20care/mhealth_finalx.pdf), cite payment reimbursement as a major hurdle. Healthcare today is still largely based on delivering care, getting people in the door, and poking and prodding; that's what keeps the lights on today. Here's a simple example - getting people to send you a pain score through SMS or a mobile app isn't reimbursable directly (there aren't billings codes or modifiers for billing codes for these things). It's a lot harder to make a convincing ROI argument for mHealth apps and services without reimbursement.

    But there are several changes coming to healthcare, some of which are already here but not at scale, that make mHealth more attractive with a more clear ROI. Triple Tree has a good [post](http://www.triple-tree.com/blog/2014/04/08/four-cms-initiatives-that-may-reshape-hospital-reimbursement/) on four major CMS initiatives that are changing reimbursement.

    * **Readmission Prevention** - simply put, if a patient sent home (discharged) from a hospital with a certain condition returns to the hospital (and is admitted) within 30 days then that's a readmission. If rates of readmission for certain conditions are high enough, compared to other hospitals, then the lower performing hospitals, ironically the ones that are probably in more financially precarious positions, will have reimbursements reduced. Right now it's only 30 days but readmission rates go up considerably at the 60 day, 6 month, and 12 month marks, and organizations eventually will be taking a financial hit on all of those as they take on more risk in payer contracts and as participants in ACOs.

    * **Hospital Acquired Conditions** - if a patient, while in the hospital, gets a new condition (like an infection), then that is "hospital acquired". Patients in hospitals are extremely vulnerable, and hospitals are disgusting places from an infectious disease perspective, so hospitals need to get much better at proactively addressing major problems like patient position rotation (laying in bed creates bed sores) and hand hygiene. Like readmissions, this is based on aggregate and relative performance.

    * **Value-Based Purchasing** - this is a fun one because it's both a carrot and a stick. Hospitals are compared to other hospitals based on clinical, mortality, and patient experience / satisfaction. Depending on how they score, they can have reimbursements increased or decreased. This is so broad is very hard to tackle other than with large scale, org-wide initiatives. It touches on a lot more than just technology, or just certain conditions.

    * **Bundled Payments** - this is my favorite from a point of entry perspective if I was a mobile health developer. Hospitals agree to take capitated, or bundled payments (a set amount), for certain conditions. This is great for a hospital because it can choose a certain procedure, and focus efforts on doing that really, really well. If it can reduce the cost for that procedure, the payment for that procedure stays the same and the hospital keeps that delta.

    All 4 areas above represent great target opportunities for new technology, and much of that new technology will be mobile, or at least have a mobile component. As the author of the Triple Tree post concluded - "Companies positioned to support hospitals in these new endeavors will find increased interest and engagement from the provider community." We couldn't agree more.

    Mobile health has huge potential but also large challenges to overcome. These reimbursement changes solve, either directly or indirectly, one of the major challenges related to selling and scaling mobile health, and we're excited to see companies having success supporting hospitals with initiatives in these areas.

    Datica is supporting some of these companies, both with technology as well as with overcoming compliance hurdles when they sell to hospitals. To learn more about how we can help you, email [us](mailto:hello@datica.com) today.

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
