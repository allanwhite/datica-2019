:summary: Since achieving our HITRUST Certification, our goal has been to educate
  the industry about our experience and help others to achieve HITRUST Certification.
:blog_lead: 'We completed our initial HITRUST assessment about three years ago. The
  process of working with the HITRUST CSF, our 3rd party HITRUST approved auditors,
  and HITRUST as a certifying body had a steep learning curve; we''ve since completed
  additional HITRUST assessments and extended our HITRUST CSF Validated Assessment
  to include additional service providers and certify product and organizational changes.
  Since achieving our HITRUST Certification, our goal has been to educate the industry
  about our [experience](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/datica-is-hitrust-certified/), both
  positive and negative, with HITRUST, and lower the barrier for others to achieve
  HITRUST Certification.

:post: |-
  We feel strongly that the healthcare industry needs a true industry-accepted certification for security and compliance in order to streamline the adoption of new technologies while maintaining the highest privacy standards for health-related data. HITRUST represents that certification in healthcare today.  We've seen the power of HITRUST at reducing our contracting process with certain covered entities from months to minutes (or however long it takes to securely upload your HITRUST Certification report). Achieving a CSF Validated Assessment, especially for those new to HITRUST, is a time consuming and [expensive][2] endeavor. That's why we're so excited HITRUST launched it's [inheritance program][3] this summer and will fully incorporate the concept of inheritance into the CSF this December.

  We knew the HITRUST CSF Inheritance Program was on the [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) roadmap for several years and we felt it would be a huge benefit to our customers. In the words of HITRUST:

  > This program simplifies the process and reduces the effort for hosting and service organization customers. By working with a participating service provider, customers can reduce the required testing and associated costs for inherited controls in a fully automated manner.

  Datica is proud to be a participating service provider in the inheritance program because it enables our customers to explicitly lean on us, and our specific controls, proof, and scores in the CSF, to streamline their own HITRUST Certification. We are working on our own guide for customers that will help estimate how much of the burden of HITRUST this relieves and what specific controls you should inherit from us. Of the roughly 7,000 entries within our own CSF, we know there is a lot of work, time, and money that our customers can get back by using this feature in the CSF.

  Using the inheritance program is [straightforward][4]. Below is a summary of the steps.

  1. When completing your CSF, choose "Request Inheritance" for any requirements you plan to inherit from Datica. Do this throughout the CSF. Our guide should help immensely with this.
  2. From the Assessment page you can then choose "Inheritance Request". This will take you to a screen where you will see all the requirements to which you selected "Request Inheritance". If you inherit all of the controls from Datica, as most of our customers will, you can choose all of the items in the list then select "Datica" from the Vendor list.
  3. Datica will then approve all those relevant controls from your request and you'll be notified via email.

  That's it. As you can see by the simplicity of the process, we think this is a huge win for our customers. We've spent lots of time and money to prove how we comply with both [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/), and now our customers can fully leverage that work directly within the HITRUST CSF.

  :summary: There's still a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about HITRUST,
    even among vendords and consultants. This article will clear up some of the confusion.
  :blog_lead: Recently, I was surprised to see a handful of online posts from vendors
    and consultants about HITRUST, voicing opinions that don't quite match up with
    my understanding and experiences. The questions raised and inaccurate claims made
    showed me that there's still a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding about
    HITRUST.
  :post: "To understand where we are today, it's important to know where [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/)
    came from. After HIPAA was passed into law in 1996, the following decade or so
    was a confusing, disorganized morass in which the HIPAA Security Rule did not
    provide prescriptive measures for covered entities (CE) and [business associates
    (BA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
    Basically, these organizations were given the flexibility to implement comprehensive
    information security programs and analyze their own levels of risk — something
    many healthcare organizations had no experience with, so even those who did have
    programs had ones that were significantly less robust than they needed.\n\nIn
    2007, leaders within the healthcare field — including CIOs, security and privacy
    officers from leading healthcare providers, insurers and vendors — came together
    to solve this problem. HITRUST initially developed an information security framework
    with the intentions of creating an industry standard, including control baselines
    so an organization could make their own choice based on their unique needs. Originally
    referred to as the [HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)](http://content.datica.com/what-is-the-hitrust-framework),
    the CSF was developed specifically for healthcare — designed to be scalable, customizable
    and capable of providing certifiable risk assurances.\n\nToday, the HITRUST CSF
    is the most widely adopted information privacy and security risk management framework
    among healthcare organizations in the United States. In addition, many organizations
    outside of the U.S. have also implemented the HITRUST CSF.\n\nNaturally, there
    are always questions and concerns about paradigm-shifting approaches — especially
    when it concerns information security and privacy. Every day seems to bring more
    risk and news stories about hacks and breaches. So it makes complete sense for
    a group of experts to lead the charge and collaboratively build a security framework
    that can benefit the entire industry. \n\nWith that said, here are a few of the
    issues that I saw being discussed online — and my take on them:\n\n## Misconception
    #1: The HITRUST approach is too expensive — costing excessive money, time and
    resources.\n\nSome people forget how things used to be — when \"doing it yourself\"
    was expensive and time-consuming, usually with poor results. While a company usually
    starts with an inexpensive [HITRUST self-assessment](http://content.datica.com/what-is-a-hitrust-csf-self-assessment),
    that's just the first step. \n\nThe costs of a HITRUST-validated assessment are
    commensurate with a third-party assessment; and if you perform a comprehensive
    assessment of any type, the costs should be roughly equivalent. Although in many
    cases, the overall information privacy and security assessment costs can be substantially
    less because of the assess-once, report-many approach supported by the HITRUST
    CSF Assurance program. The alignment between the HITRUST CSF and CSF Assurance
    programs allows a single CSF Assessment report to support multiple objectives
    (such as a HIPAA risk assessment or an assessment against the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework), and this same report can be accepted by multiple external parties
    (business partners, government agencies, etc.) — reducing the costs associated
    with multiple assessments. \n\nIn addition, a HITRUST CSF assessment will identify
    which controls will be evaluated and provide illustrative assessment procedures,
    which allow for better preparation — and potentially reducing costs. In addition,
    an organization can get a HITRUST CSF Validated report and a SOC 2 report based
    on one assessment, making the costs substantially less than doing two separate
    assessments.\n\nOf course, determining the ultimate value of a HITRUST CSF Assessment
    centers on the peace of mind found after going through the process — and knowing
    that a breach can cost millions of dollars. Also, what are the other options that
    would be comprehensive, relevant and consistent, while offering the needed transparency?
    \ \n\nComparatively, the costs of the HITRUST approach are negligible. It might
    seem reductive to say, but the age-old question must be considered: \"How much
    are you willing to spend for peace of mind?\" Of course, more bottom-line-focused
    professionals simply have to look at the return on investment (ROI) to see the
    true value.\n\n## Misconception #2: It's unnecessarily burdensome to implement
    the HITRUST methodology.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the \"old way\" of establishing
    your own information security program was both undirected and cumbersome, costing
    tremendous amounts of time and money. To be sure, implementing the HITRUST CSF
    at my company took effort. \n\nBut all of us at Datica understand the importance
    of comprehensive risk management, and chose HITRUST to help us train for a higher
    level of information security and create the optimal organizational structure.
    \n\nWhile the assessment required significant time and resources to complete,
    the ability to satisfy multiple assessment and reporting requirements saved us
    both time and money in the long run. (Based on our experience, we also recommend
    designating a team member as the internal subject matter expert.) We truly believe
    it's more than worth the effort.\n\nOne of my esteemed colleagues, Lee Penn, is
    the CFO and Chief Compliance Officer at PDHI —  a SaaS company that develops and
    distributes the ConXus Platform for delivering workplace wellness and population
    health management programs. Lee — also a member of the HITRUST Business Associate
    Council — noted that his company had a similar experience to ours. He said that
    while it was time and resource-intensive — particularly so, as it was the first
    third-party attestation that PDHI had ever sought — they're a better company,
    with a more effective information privacy and security program for having made
    the effort to achieve certification under the HITRUST CSF. It's now part of the
    PDHI culture — and the resources they now save by not having to undergo repetitive
    assessments easily offsets the ongoing costs of maintaining the certification
    — while heightening PDHI's trustworthiness to its clients.\n\nWhile other methodologies
    use a simplistic and non-prescriptive \"red/yellow/green stoplight\" and costly,
    unique questionnaires — which most would agree provided too much wiggle room with
    compliance — HITRUST's more sophisticated scoring model provides better accuracy
    and precision than a checklist approach, and subsequently better assurances about
    the state of an organization's information protection, whether for use internally
    or by a third party. \n\n## Misconception #3: The results and efficacy of the
    HITRUST approach are questionable.\n\nQuite simply, nobody else reaches the level
    of quality assurance for third-party assessments as those conducted by HITRUST
    Assessors. And organizations now have over 50 assessors (a number that continues
    to grow) to choose from, so users can \"shop around\" and take advantage of free
    market dynamics to find one that meets their specific needs. \n\nI was recently
    speaking with Pamela Arora — senior vice president and chief information officer
    at Children's Health in Dallas — who has seen the same benefits from her organization's
    efforts as my own company. She observed that with the threat landscape continuously
    evolving, we must continue work to ensure our security programs protect patient
    and organizational data from end to end, because you're only as strong as your
    weakest link. Protecting data, she noted, is one of their highest priorities;
    therefore, if a partner goes through the third-party certification with HITRUST,
    they're able to be more confident that the organization's security posture is
    not eroded, since they know the partners also meet CSF security requirements.
    \  \n\nPamela recognizes that challenges exist. In some instances, an organization's
    culture may initially be resistant to pursuing certification, but with continued
    encouragement from the industry — and demonstration of the value in CSF certification
    — they're confident that potential resistance will ultimately melt away.\n\nClearly,
    the widespread adoption of the HITRUST CSF — which is used for everything from
    a \"best practices\" reference to the basis for a certifiable information protection
    program — demonstrates that the HITRUST approach works. If that's not enough evidence,
    a recent review by Allied World U.S. stated that [\"organizations that had obtained
    a HITRUST CSF Certification posed lower cyber-related risks than those organizations
    that have not.\"][1]\n\n## Misconception #4: Making HITRUST certification a requirement
    is unfair. \n\nThis complaint really confuses me — and I'm a vendor. There are
    many good reasons why organizations are requiring a HITRUST CSF certification
    of their business associates, and most of them positively benefit the business
    associates. Covered entities have been expanding and enhancing their information
    protection since passage of the HITECH ACT — a trend which has only been exacerbated
    by recent statistics on 3rd party-related breaches. \n\nThe result has been an
    increase in the number of requests for assessments or other forms of assurance
    — which are often different from one covered entity to another, and subsequently
    add cost and complexity to the healthcare system. Fortunately, this trend has
    been recognized by a growing number of covered entities, who have seen resources
    distracted from their own information protection programs to perform and evaluate
    assessments of their vendors and other business associates.\n\nFor organizations
    that have a strong information privacy and security program, undergoing a HITRUST
    CSF assessment is not a difficult process — and those that aren't committed to
    stronger privacy and security were not going to hide from a comprehensive assessment
    regardless. This way, they have a smart option that can be used more broadly across
    the industry. In fact, that's one of the roles of the HITRUST Business Associate
    Council — to ensure that vendors are fully engaging in the process and working
    more broadly with the industry (and even across industries) to ensure the HITRUST
    CSF Assessment reports are accepted. \n\n## The bottom line: Together, we can
    make things better.\n\nBuilding industry consensus on information protection methodologies
    and standards is what the [HITRUST Alliance](https://hitrustalliance.net/) is
    all about. It takes experienced, respected professionals to lead the way for improvements
    in any industry, and healthcare is no different. Professionals from every corner
    of the industry have provided — and continue to provide — their valuable time
    and insight. HITRUST welcomes active participation in its committees and working
    groups, and constructive feedback through its comment process from anyone in the
    field who would like to share their ideas for the betterment of us all. \n\nThe
    truth is that we're all in this together, and our common goal is the common good
    — protecting individually identifiable healthcare information. At every level,
    our industry has to embrace the shift to digital management of healthcare information,
    understand the risks involved in this change, and take appropriate steps to manage
    them. By working together, we can all focus on creating practical, reliable ways
    to improve security and minimize risk. In my view, HITRUST has taken a leading
    role in improving the state of information protection in the healthcare industry
    and is doing so efficiently and effectively.\n\n[1]: https://hitrustalliance.net/content/uploads/2016/02/HITRUST-CSF-AWAC-Cyber-Insurance-PR_final-for-wire.pdf"

    below are my predictions for healthcare in 2016, with a bend towards healthcare
    technology.
  :post: |-
    ## 1. HITRUST For the Win

    As we [wrote about last week][1], HITRUST Certification will be a core requirement for business associates and partners of many large covered entities like United, Humana, and Anthem. This announcement, made last month, has already started to have a significant impact in the industry. Catalyze has several customers that have received letters requiring that they start the process of obtaining HITRUST Certification. Additionally, we are finalizing a contract for Catalyze as a business associate for a large insurer and our security review in that process consisted of us sending our HITRUST Certification (yes, that's it). HITRUST Certification also ties to a broader trend to increase focus on cybersecurity. As more covered entities begin requiring HITRUST Certification, which is happening more and more everyday through letters to existing business associates and as part of new contracting processes, HITRUST will become the standard compliance framework that people seek to streamline sales and implementations. Shameless plug – [Catalyze is HITRUST Certified][2] and can accelerate your path to certification.

    ## 2. Toning back the hype on tech-only

    mHealth apps are wonderful and potentially very powerful but they aren't going to fix healthcare or health in the US on their own. Success in healthcare is going to require more than an app. It's going to require a strategy into how you get that app into the hands of the right patient at the right time, how you get that patient to care enough to use the app, and how you monitor app usage to assure people don't fall off the radar. This year, we're going to see a reaction from the industry in which buyers (hospitals and payers mostly) expect app makers to be more sophisticated about how apps fit into the current and evolving healthcare system.

    ## 3. Finally finding an ROI for EHRs

    EHRs are here to stay. The majority of providers now use EHRs. Today EHRs are the main clinical data repository and the center of clinical workflows. Now that we've largely completed the adoption stage of EHRs, the second and third wave of EHR implementations are now coming. The second wave is optimizing the EHR and use of the EHR and the third wave is extending the EHR with new tech/data enabled services. We're seeing new tech-enabled services for things like clinical communications, patient engagement, care management, and telemedicine as add-ons to EHRs and not simply standalone solutions.

    ### 3.1 Interoperability is a requirement

    I numbered this prediction as 3.1 but it could really be a 2.1/3.1. It's becoming clear that implementing new technology or services at health systems requires a good plan for integrating with an EHR. Integration can't just be an afterthought. It needs to add value of the technology or service. Removing the roadblock of integration is the key to accelerating adoption. in 2016 integrating with an EHR is not a differentiator, it's a requirement.

    ## 4. Telemedicine finds its way into existing practices

    Telemedicine is gaining traction. To date telemedicine has largely been outsourced as an add-on or as a convenient and cheap way to access an anonymous provider. We will definitely keep seeing that trend in telemedicine, but I think we're going to start seeing telemedicine as an integrated part of existing practices. There have been technologies to do this but we're now starting to get to the tipping point as some telemedicine platforms are solving key challenges around integrating telemedicine into existing schedules as well as reimbursement for telemedicine. I think specialty practices will be the big adopters of this type of integrated telemedicine in 2016.

    ## 5. Asynchronous Telemedicine takes off

    I remember when I first heard about [Zipnosis][3] about 6 years ago. At the time I thought it was brilliant, and I still do. I think the healthcare industry has finally caught on to how effectively asynchronous telemedicine can reduce costs and help adhere to evidence-based treatment protocols. And it succeeds without necessarily disrupting clinical workflows. I think we're going to see these asynchronous services take off and offered by more and more integrated health systems, ACOs, payers, and employers.

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
