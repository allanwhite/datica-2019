:summary: Datica's journey to Series A started with what we learned over the last
  several years in our previous startups and through a countless number of discussions
  with people in the industry.
:blog_lead: 'Datica is the 3rd startup this founding team has launched over the last
  several years. The first, AccessMobile, ended up focused on global health with paying
  customers in Africa but without a truly scalable business model. The second startup,
  Share.MD, was focused on physician collaboration, profiles, education, and communications;
  we pitched at Health 2.0, had pilots at 3 academic centers and many, many discussions
  on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto with “interested” investors before ultimately deciding
  that we were creating something that we weren’t positioned to distribute and solving
  a problem we weren’t passionate enough about.

'
:post: "Datica is really the product of what we learned over the last several years
  in our previous startups and through a countless number of discussions with people
  in the industry. Yes, Datica is a new venture; but, we started it with the benefit
  of learnings from an infinite number of mistakes over the last few years. I wouldn’t
  call it a pivot, but it’s not a totally “new” idea either. Ironically, many of the
  things we are building and selling now are things that we wish we had with our previous
  startups. They are the cloud-based services that would have made it much faster
  and easier to launch those other startups. We saw this opportunity, and discussed
  it, over the last several years but didn’t pursue it until last spring.\n\nWe founded
  Datica in April of this year with a pretty vague and lofty goal - to simplify the
  process of building modern health technology. We knew the major challenges we’d
  personally encountered in building health apps, namely around cloud-based compliance/security
  and data (access, models, interfaces), were areas we were targeting. We basically
  set out to build the [compliant infrastructure](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/)
  that we wish we had in our previous startups. And have tons of ideas for apps and
  solutions we want to build on our infrastructure in time.\n\nWe also knew when we
  started Datica that cloud infrastructure outside of healthcare had been created
  to provide specific tools for mobile and web developers, and those tools had been
  very successful; so we had good analogs and comparables (more on this later) when
  we started.\n\nWe started out by building APIs so any app developer could add [compliant
  healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) services (users,
  authentication, access controls, file and custom object storage, structured patient
  data storage mapped to existing exchange standards, PHI-flagging) without touching
  a server or database. We currently provide developers with hosted infrastructure
  including end-to-end encryption, complete redundancy, dedicated encrypted logging
  (who accessed what and when and from what source), uptime monitoring, disaster recovery,
  archiving, and proactive correction of issues. And we provide all of this in an
  environment that has undergone a 3rd party HIPAA assessment, meaning we follow all
  aspects of HIPAA - technical, policy, and administrative. There are major differences
  between us and other compliant hosting providers, but that’s not the point of this
  post.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but it’s a hard sell because 1) infrastructure
  doesn’t demo well, 2) most investors outside of the bay area (at least the ones
  we talked to) don’t understand technology well enough to understand and appreciate
  different layers of infrastructure, and 3) health tech is a bit like a black box
  to a lot of investors once you say “no, we’re not an EMR” (this is pretty legitimate
  given the lack of good comparisons other than things like iTriage and maybe ZocDoc
  and HealthTap). Selling a platform, whether to investors or customers, is hard.
  It’s great if your successful but it’s a hard thing to sell when you’re getting
  started. Our experience with large funds was that the healthcare people mostly knew
  life sciences (meds and devices) and the technical people didn’t really know healthcare.
  This wasn’t universally true, but it seemed like a major challenge for health IT
  startups that don’t fit nicely in a predefined bucket. There are funds and firms
  that are focused on health IT, but there are lots of others that don’t have that
  experience yet.\n\nAnd if I’m being completely honest, at the start we didn’t dig
  deep enough into the specifics of the solutions and apps we were enabling, so we
  didn’t have concrete or tangible apps in mind at the start. That’s changed a lot
  as we’ve discovered early enterprise customers are very interested in engagement,
  or more broadly digital engagement strategy, and the technology to accomplish that
  strategy. Digital patient or member engagement is at least a little more specific
  than just “health apps”. And from that specificity some very targeted admin functionality,
  data access and analytics capabilities, and dashboards fall out pretty fast; all
  of those things are much easier to demo and sell to customers and to investors.\n\nBack
  to fundraising. Since we’re located in Wisconsin, we focused most of our investment
  efforts in the Midwest, and met probably every fund and angel group from Chicago
  to Minneapolis. We met and spoke with others, both large and small, in Nashville,
  Boston, Los Angeles, Austin, Florida, New York, Ohio, Nebraska, and Palo Alto. I
  don’t have the exact number of funds we talked to but it was probably 35-40, and
  at least that number of angel investors. I genuinely liked probably 95% of the investors
  I met. Even when saying “no” most of them were very courteous and thoughtful about
  it. Some investors knew almost nothing about healthcare, others knew a lot; but,
  I discovered that knowing healthcare wasn’t necessary to ask good questions and
  provide good feedback.\n\nThe hardest part about raising money in the Midwest, and
  the big reason I think it’s so much easier in Northern California, is the proximity
  and large amount of time required to meet with investors. In the bay area, you can
  easily do 6 or more meetings in a day, all with real funds that can write checks
  quickly. In the Midwest, we tried to package our days in places like Chicago but
  it’s still a pretty significant effort and eats a lot of time, especially when it
  comes to doing follow-up meetings.\n\nThe other issue most people cite for raising
  in California is the high valuations startups get there. This is a valid argument.
  Angelist has very nice visuals for valuations if you’re interested. In the end valuation
  wasn’t an issue for us but I know other founders in the Midwest that raised money
  on very low valuations. It’s almost a running joke in startup circles in the Midwest.\n\nWe
  started talking to funds in late July. Those last 2 weeks in July were mostly warm
  up, refining our pitch, learning where the holes were, and more importantly learning
  how to ask for and get a direct answer about investment. Investors can waste a lot
  of your time if you don’t just ask them directly if they want to invest or what
  they’d need to see to invest. Closing a pitch with “email me if you’re interested”
  doesn’t work. We just asked if they wanted to invest and, if they hedged or said
  they needed time, we asked when we would have an answer. If investors said no we
  simply asked why not. Getting a “no” with a reason is much more valuable than dragging
  out the conversation without an answer.\n\nWe really started fundraising in earnest
  in August. At that time we were targeting a seed round of $700,000, and thought
  it would be smaller funds and angels filling it. We got commitments, but no term
  sheets, from a few angels and a smallish WI fund for about $500,000 of the $700,000
  by the end of August. We pushed for term sheets but it just took a bit of time.\n\nWe
  had a few larger funds that we’d met that we really wanted as investors, and we
  targeted them with follow-up each time we got a new commitment from an investor.
  Those funds had all said “no” to us in August because we were too early stage. So
  we pestered them in a very nice way. We also updated those funds on product and
  revenue status whenever we had something we thought was material. We signed 2 new
  enterprise contracts at the end of August so those helped us a lot in engaging investors.\n\nAt
  the end of August we pitched at the demo day for Gener8tor, the accelerator program
  in which we participated. After the pitch, one of the larger funds we’d been targeting
  approached us and said they wanted to lead our round, but $700,000 wasn’t enough
  for what we were trying to do and they’d like to raise that number to over $1 million;
  that was a conversation I’ll probably never forget and thankfully I already had
  a beer in my hand so I didn’t have to go far to celebrate.\n\nThe following day
  I had coffee with one of the partners of another one of the funds we wanted, and
  they also committed to leading a larger round. And a couple of days after that we
  got a call from a 3rd large, strategic fund that wanted to co-lead. In the end,
  we got the 3 funds to co-lead the round together and commit $2 million to our Series
  A. The funny part is, we started getting calls and emails immediately from funds
  that had previously said “no” but now wanted to invest. All of a sudden, miraculously
  almost, the barriers to investing had been lifted. It was a bit surreal saying “no”
  to investors asking to put in money, and to say no to increasing the size of our
  round. We really didn’t want to raise more money than we needed. A few of those
  conversations were painful because I’d grown to like the investors personally.\n\nWe
  signed term sheets on September 17th and finally closed the round about 8 weeks
  later. If you asked me in September, right around signing the term sheet, what I
  thought of the fundraising process, I would’ve said it’s exhausting but not so bad
  really. The people are nice and you learn a lot about how people interpret your
  message. We were happy with what we raised, the terms we raised it on, and the funds
  that invested.\n\nIf you asked me the same question, what I thought about the fundraising
  process, in the beginning of November, right before we closed the round, I would
  have told you fundraising was the absolute worst part of my experience in startups.
  The legal and administrative process, and document signing, and on and on and on
  was incredibly painful and distracting. It just dragged on, and there always seemed
  to be one more document to sign or person to track down or approval to get. On a
  bright note, the new Docusign interface is pretty sweet so that made using it every
  day a little less painful. Hopefully if we ever raise money again we’ll have more
  internal resources to spread the admin load around.\n\nThe one other thing that
  shocked me, and still shocks me, about the fundraising process is the cost of legal
  work to get to closing. Being well represented is essential in the process, but
  the amount of legal time, and cost, is substantial. By the time we paid both law
  firms, our own firm and the firm representing our investor syndicate, we could have
  paid a full time developer for a year. I like our attorneys and they were a huge
  help, but they certainly weren’t cheap.\n\nSo what got us to “yes” at a much higher
  number and valuation than we originally set out to raise? I think our investors,
  and I think all investors that invest in early stage, are betting on a formula.
  That formula is some variation of market size and opportunity, team to execute,
  and early traction. I think there are some intangibles in this as well, but by and
  large I think that’s the formula. If you need to fundraise, and not every startup
  does or should, then building messaging around that formula is extremely helpful.
  If you’ve seen any of the YCombinator demo day pitches, they pretty much all follow
  this formula.\n\nOur pitch mapped exactly to that formula. Stepwise it went like
  this - \n1) healthcare is broken and massive changes are coming, \n2) a hole exists
  to help build the tools needed for those changes, \n3) healthcare is a multi-trillion
  dollar industry, \n4) we have an experienced team to fill the hole, and \n5) we
  have customers already using us; my hope is that the actual pitch was more interesting
  than that but you could boil the message down to those points. \n\nI’m betting almost
  every health startup raising money has the same #1 and #3 above, probably with variations
  of the same values and charts; those seem to be a necessary part of the story but
  investors, almost every investor I talked to, already get those.\n\nItem 2 above,
  the specific problem being solved, will be unique, at least somewhat unique, to
  each startup, and will need to be defendable when questioned. For us, the most effective
  way to explain and defend our specific problem was to make comparables to other
  successful hosted services and companies outside of healthcare. There aren’t any
  perfect analogs for us, but there has been a ton of activity in the API infrastructure
  industry over the last few years. And, from an investor perspective, a lot of the
  activity has been acquisition activity. So that helped us a lot to tell the story
  of what was missing in healthcare, and defending our #2 point above.\n\nBut, I believe
  getting a health startup funded, and the reasons we were successful in our fundraising
  efforts, are all about #4 and #5 - team and traction. You need a team and you need
  to show real interest and demand from the industry. Starting with our team. It helped
  us to know health and health IT well enough to answer a broad range of questions
  about the industry. We can go broad and deep when it comes to health. It also helped
  give us technical credibility to have commitments from technical people with brand
  name backgrounds and experience building production technology. We built our team
  to cover industry, enterprise sales, and technology - the three main areas we felt
  were required for success. And just like with selling, we pre-hired and got commitments
  before we got funding.\n\nLast but not least is traction. If you have any customers,
  and especially if you have any real revenue, then you prove your #2, about the problem.
  You also prove #4, the team, because you are already selling. So customers are key.
  I realize it’s hard to build anything for free, which is largely why we took seed
  investment from an accelerator. That seed funding of $50,000 enabled us to get a
  prototype and pre-sell a couple early enterprise pilots. That, I think, is what
  really got us funded.\n\nAs I said, it was exceptionally painful at the end, the
  getting to closing part, so I’m grateful for my friends and family that put up with
  my lack of being present and my constant grumpiness when present. We have a very
  long way to go from here but we’re happy with where we are. Funding, despite all
  the press and attention we give it, is not a great measure of success. Revenue and
  happy customers are the real metrics that count. And now we have real accountability
  on those metrics - a board, professional directors, monthly investor updates, and
  so on.\n\nThis post was originally posted on HIStalkConnect.\n\n"

  :summary: We're excited for our first real board meeting and will report back on
    how it fit our expectations.
  :blog_lead: 'We''re prepping for our first real board meeting. I say "real" because
    we''ve done the founders-only board meeting before, which was just the 2 founders
    and our lawyer. When you raise money, as everybody will tell you, the company
    you founded does not belong to you anymore. We''re completely happy with that
    outcome though we put a slightly different spin on it - the company we founded
    is growing with the addition of new valuable partners that can help us maximize
    our chances of success and accelerate our growth. We raised money both for the
    capital as well as for the strategic assistance.

'
  :post: "And with our Series A our board grew from 2, just founders (me/Travis and
    Mohan), to 5. We, as the founders, kept 2 board seats and the Chairman position,
    while 2 seats were added for lead investors and one seat was added for an at-large
    seat; that at-large seat will be filled with a founder and CEO from another company,
    but that process is a post unto itself. We also have a couple board observers
    that attend, or call into, board meetings. We also have monthly status updates
    we need to send out to all investors. The point is we now have a larger board
    and more people that need to approve plans and assess our performance as management
    for the company. Since culturally feedback and accountability are important to
    us as a company, this fits well.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it is we can approach our
    board, and our board meetings, in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. We have a board,
    made up of people that know more than we do about things certain aspects of business
    and our market, that we need to report to and ask permission to do things. In
    this approach the board is simply an overseer with veto power. Founders who take
    this approach tend to dread board meetings.\r\n2. We have a board, made up of
    people with far more experience in building companies than us, that are vested
    in our success and are available to provide insight and feedback into our plans,
    metrics, and performance. In this approach the board is a trusted and strategic
    advisor. Founders who take this approach look forward to board meetings.\r\n\r\nWe
    opt to take the latter approach, and view our board, and our board meetings, as
    a valuable opportunity to help us improve and achieve our goals for the company.
    We want feedback on our performance and we want strategic assistance. We are pretty
    critical of ourselves as a team, and we are constantly trying to get better, but
    outside input is exceptionally valuable, both to validate when we are on the right
    track as well as to help us identify when to course correct. We see board interactions
    as a great way to get free guidance; it's \"free\" now because we've already sold
    the shares and the investors have already wired the money.\r\n\r\nWe also recognize
    that we want help with areas like strategy, focus, partnerships, and financial
    assumptions and metrics. These are areas that we can discuss at length internally
    but need outside input and more voices, especially ones that have been there,
    at the table. We're excited for our first real board meeting and will report back
    on how it fit our expectations.\r\n\r\n"
