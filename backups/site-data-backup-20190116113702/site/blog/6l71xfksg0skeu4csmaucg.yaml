:summary: Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing
  the male-dominated technology landscape. Just last week in Stockholm, the Women
  in Tech 2018 conference sold out completely in just two minutes after tickets went
  on sale.
:blog_lead: "Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing
  the male-dominated technology landscape. Just last week in Stockholm, the [Women
  in Tech 2018](https://www.womenintech.se/) conference sold out completely in just
  two minutes after tickets went on sale. It seems that you can’t read today’s news
  without finding another story about women speaking out about gender injustices.
  Though women have made major strides forward on issues around equality, gender diversity
  in the workplace — especially at the top — remains an unattained goal. \n\n\n"
:post: "\nWomen start out their careers just behind men in terms of everything from
  position to salary. As the chart below shows, that gap begins to widen as they’re
  up for their first promotion to manager, giving men an early head start in the race
  to leadership positions. They’re also less likely to be hired directly into leadership
  positions or to start their own businesses. \n\nAlmost nowhere is this trend more
  prevalent than in the technology, and particularly cloud, industry. As a woman who
  began a very slow crawl up the corporate ladder at technology companies nearly thirty
  years ago, and who often finds herself as the only female leader around a table
  of men, I can personally attest to the absence of women in technology and leadership
  roles.\n\nStartups fail at the [alarming rate of 90%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#190f14636679)
  and most of them are coincidentally led by males. In fact, last year in the United
  States only 20% of businesses were owned by women, and women accounted for just
  16% of executives. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6NN0Vp7GlUmqgm4EgAkGyC/f05ae0ef8fbbc8ce3718b1241bd5da51/Screen_Shot_2018-01-31_at_3.14.46_PM.png\"
  alt=\"Gender representation in corporate pipeline 2016\">\n*Source: Women in the
  Workplace 2016 study by leanin.org and McKinsey & Company*\n\nThe funding statistics
  are even more alarming with less than 3% of VC funding going to female founders.
  Translating that into dollars, $58.2B in venture capital funds went to all-male
  founders and only $1.46B to female founders. At the same time, [many studies](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)
  show that better business results are tied to greater diversity in the workplace
  and on the leadership team.\n\n> Women-led businesses outperform comparable businesses
  led by male counterparts,” Jacqueline Touma, Founder/CEO Curious Enterprises\n\nThese
  statistics and facts are alarming yet many companies and individuals are joining
  the effort to alter the male-dominated leadership dynamic at play. Companies’ commitment
  to gender diversity is at an all-time high, and new opportunities are emerging regularly
  to cultivate more females in STEM fields, leadership roles, and as company founders.\n\n##
  Women in Cloud Seattle\n\nOne of those notable new efforts was the inaugural [Women
  in Cloud](http://www.womenincloud.com/) summit in Seattle, led by the Ignite WA
  leadership team in collaboration with industry partners, Microsoft Corporation,
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Meylah. On a typical rainy Seattle January
  day, I had the pleasure of joining more than 350 technology leaders, predominantly
  women, at Microsoft’s Redmond campus for the event. We came together to celebrate
  the few female entrepreneurs in the tech world, discuss the issues that prevent
  women from becoming leaders and company founders, and to commit to offer a way forward
  through mentorship, community access, and funding.\n\n> You cannot have a strong
  business if you do not have diverse perspective. This room has to go make that change,”
  Gretchen O’Hara, Vice President US OCP Microsoft\n \nA great lineup of speakers
  from the Washington technology and VC community spoke on topics ranging from the
  language of inclusion and the journey of women in tech, to accelerating women entrepreneurship
  in the cloud. Entrepreneurship was a common theme with two big announcements of
  projects to help female-funded startups.\n\n## Women in Cloud Accelerator Program\n\nGavriella
  Schuster, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft shared information about a new initiative
  to help highly-motivated women who are founders of business-to-business cloud or
  technology companies. [The Cloud Accelerator Lab](http://www.womenincloud.com/about/accelerator/)
  is an immersive 6-month program for female founders to start and build their businesses
  with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft distribution channels. Twenty
  to thirty selected participants team together and live together in Seattle to receive
  access to resources, mentorship, and funding to build their cloud businesses.\n\n>
  My daughter's outlook on the barriers in front of her is so different than mine
  were at her age—let’s make sure that keeps happening,\" Gavriella Schuster, Corporate
  Vice President at Microsoft\n\n## Sybilla Masters Fund\n\nAnother highlight of the
  Women in Cloud summit was the announcement of the new Sybilla Masters Fund by Gillian
  Muessig, Co-Founder of MOZ and now CEO of [Outlines Venture Group](http://outlinesventure.com/).
  Sybilla Masters won a patent for her corn mill invention in 1720, becoming the first
  woman in the United States to receive a patent. It was awarded in her husband's
  name because a woman wasn't technically eligible, though he fought to make it known
  that Sybilla was the inventor. The new fund, named after Colonial America’s first
  female inventor, will officially launch when it reaches $2 million with an ultimate
  goal of raising $100 million. \n\nIn Muessig’s own words as published in [an interview
  with GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/moz-co-founder-gillian-muessig-unveils-new-venture-fund-back-women-led-startups/):\n\n>
  The object of the game here is to provide a fund that does gender-lensed investing,
  and that does not mean investing only in females or female founders. It really means
  looking at a company with the idea that says: How does this affect all genders,
  and in what way does it further the idea that all genders working together create
  a better outcome?”\n\nMicrosoft veteran, Alka Badshah and Outlines Venture Group
  President Anne Kennedy are founding investors in the Sybilla Masters Fund and will
  also serve as advisors to Muessig, who is the general partner and manages the fund’s
  investments. \n \n\nWith this renewed effort and enthusiasm, I am hopeful we'll
  finally see the trends reverse in the near future. And, as the statistics prove,
  women-owned businesses perform better so we may also see the startup failure rate
  decline as more female founders are funded and set up for success. \n\nHelping startups
  get from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises has always been
  part of the core of Datica’s DNA. We’re excited to share the news about these new
  initiatives with our own community of healthcare technology innovators in the hopes
  of seeing more female-led digital health businesses make it to market. \n\n\n"

  :summary: Sue Schade, who recently was awarded [CIO of the Year by CHIME and HIMSS](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/u-of-michigan-s-sue-schade-named-cio-of-the-year-by-chime.html),
    joined us to talk about her experience with previously bringing new frameworks
    and programs into Brigham and Women's in Boston and what innovation looks like
    in her new post as CIO at University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers.
    We capped it off with some wonderful insight for startups looking to bring innovation
    into hospitals.
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. In order to sell into a hospital, your solution _must_ solve a real, important problem within the system. Entrepreneurs: start there!
    2. Looking at core metrics with a balanced perspective allows you to spot innovation insight in more areas.
    3. Mobile computing is one of the hottest and most important areas for change and innovation within a healthcare setting.
    4. As an external vendor, the sooner you become engaged with the CIO in a meaningful way, the sooner your solution can be deployed across a health system.

    **Datica:** Thank you, Sue, so much for joining us today. Looking forward to our conversation. First and foremost, besides thanking you for joining us, I wanted to congratulate you on getting CIO of the Year.

    **Ms. Schade:** Thank you.

    **Datica:** Hopefully you have been getting a lot of congratulations. It's a pretty big honor. There are people, there are a lot of good CIOs, and so it's a pretty big honor, so congratulations on that.

    **Ms. Schade:** Thank you very much.

    **Datica:** I don't think it's an easy honor to get either.

    **Ms. Schade:** Right. [Laughter]

    **Datica:** I kind of wanted to dig in a little bit, you know, the CIO of the Year, and your experience as a CIO. What does it mean to you to be an effective CIO, to be somebody who can be in a place to get an honor like that?

    **Ms. Schade:** Great question, and I have been asked that question in some of the other interviews I've done. Let me comment that there's both a personal component and a professional component.

    From a personal perspective, I have a husband of many, many, many years and two grown daughters, and I think they're both very proud of my accomplishments and also know how hard I have worked over the many years that I have been in this field, which is in the range of 30. And it's great, especially in raising young women, to be a role model for them and watching them grow in their careers is part of what I do as their role model, as a mother, and as a professional woman.

    From a professional perspective, being honored by my peers is a true honor. And I know that I join an impressive group of leaders over the years. I think I am the 26th CIO of the Year. That's how long they've been doing it. And I will say that I am the 4th woman in those 26 years, so hope to see many more women receiving this kind of an honor in the coming years as there are more and more women in the ranks of healthcare CIOs.

    **Datica:** From our own perspective, we hire a lot of developers and engineers and there are challenges with rounding out our team to be more representative, and so that's actually a challenge for us still. But I think having role models, people that they can see, so it's not 26 men that have gotten the award, that there's a little bit of blending, I think, is a great thing. Those types of examples are more of what we need. So, additional kudos.

    **Ms. Schade:** Thank you. Well, and that actually is something I've been talking more about lately, in terms blogging, is the need to encourage more women to go into technology, because the numbers just aren't there, and to find ways to encourage them and support them as they grow in their careers. I know people helped me along the way, and I'm committed to helping the next generation of HIT leaders to grow and develop.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/dap6sh4ihq" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Datica:** Shifting gears just slightly, and looking back at some of your previous experience, you were at Brigham and Women's right before going to Michigan. Is that right?

    **Ms. Schade:** Correct. I was there for almost 13 years as their CIO.

    **Datica:** Wow. That's a good amount of time. When you were there you implemented or used the Balanced Scorecard Initiative. We've read about Balanced Scorecard. I'd like to get a better sense from you, hands-on experience, why you felt like that was an effective tool to Brigham and Women's, and why you feel like it's an effective thing to use within healthcare organizations.

    **Ms. Schade:** Sure. First off, just the Balanced Scorecard, to frame it, is a framework, conceptual framework, not a specific tool, and that framework says that there are four key components. One is finance. But too often, we think only finance, and what's the bottom line, and what's the revenue and the cost look like. One is your customers, or your patients, in our case. One is your operational effectiveness and quality. And the fourth one is employees, so what you are doing to grow your own employees and develop them.

    When you look at something from that balanced perspective, you're really looking at metrics in all those areas and how they interact. It was a framework that had been adopted by many of the Fortune 500 companies as of the early 2000's, and it was relatively new for healthcare. We had a champion leader within Brigham and Women's who said it's time for us to do this. He and I partnered, made it happen, and ended up being a showcase site within healthcare for our initiative over the years. We used a particular vendor's analytics, dashboard kind of product to implement it, but it's a concept framework that you can do with various tools.

    **Datica:** Interesting. As you became the case study in Boston and now as you transition to Michigan, do you see that, or are you maybe not whole hog using that framework but potentially integrating aspects of that as you start to think more broadly than maybe just finance driving decisions?

    **Ms. Schade:** Yes. In fact, at University of Michigan Health System right now we are talking about a framework that includes—make sure I get it right—safety, quality, delivery, finance, and people. So there's five components, and we're looking at what are the major initiatives, you know, the definition of each of those, the major initiatives in each of those, and then what the metrics are. So there's a similarity there. It's something that we're working through at this point.

    **Datica:** That framework didn't really exist before you were at Michigan? It's something that's in development now?

    **Ms. Schade:** It's in development now, but I can't take credit for bringing it. I've been here two and a half years, and I think whenever you move leadership levels from one organization to the next, you want to bring some of the best ideas and best practices from the organization that you are at into your new organization, and, certainly, I tried to do that in this case as well as in other examples. But it's a combination of that input along with where this organization is at and some other leaders here, recognizing the need that we need to do that.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/h81ahcudvd" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Datica:** With this framework that you're developing at Michigan, I wanted to ask some questions around in new solutions, new innovative products or service lines, or whatever form they might take. It may be technology-enabled, it may just be new services out in the community.

    When you look at new innovation initiatives proposed at Michigan, do you funnel all those through that framework to look at how you would assess something like that? Is that how you would assess it?

    **Ms. Schade:** No. I can't say that those two match up at this point. What I just described is very much a framework we were starting to roll out within the clinical care delivery component of the health system, and, in all honesty, much of the innovation that's going on is more coming out of the medical school and the research side. I think we need to probably do a much better job of marrying those two up, to be quite honest with you, but we have lots of examples in terms of our research area and our faculty where we're looking at various innovations that we can talk more about.

    **Datica:** When you talk about marrying up, you're talking about innovations or new research-based things coming out of the medical school or the research area and having those then translate into actual clinical delivery?

    **Ms. Schade:** Yes. As well as looking at those innovations through that lens in terms of how could they improve safety care. Could they improve quality of care? How could they improve the timeliness of delivery of care? I will give you an example that one of the things that has been going on for the past several months is a group that has been looking at disruptive innovation in care at home.

    I won't be able to quote it exactly right, but there were three key metrics that they were charged with trying to improve. One of them being the admission rates, for example. Just very recently, in fact, I have the 100-plus page report and set of recommendations from them was sent to me on the weekend, I've been able to read the executive summary but not really wade into it yet.

    Its extensive set of recommendations and ideas that they have, it was a faculty-based group on how we can do things differently in terms of care outside our four walls, within the home, to affect some key metrics right now, which is something that all healthcare organizations really are going to be going through as you look at less inpatient care, more ambulatory, more care in different care settings.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/j7mj96ady4" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Datica:** That makes a lot of sense. I had a follow up on that, but I was curious, too: You talked about different care settings, and you talked about providing home care. Are there other broad bucket areas of innovation that you see coming out of the medical school or that were being research driven at Michigan?

    **Ms. Schade:** Certainly mobile. And that's a really broad statement, but mobile apps for clinicians, mobile apps for patients. I mean, you think about it in your own life... In fact, this was one of the blogs I wrote in a December timeframe. I think it was maybe the timing relative to the announcement of the CIO award and the combination of the fact that I had a really catchy title on this book blog called "Great Textpectations". It got a whole lot of views.

    What I talked about was when we were back in Boston over the holidays to see family. We spent time in a hospital with his brother, who had surgery, and in and out of the hospital every day. I talked about how technology is everywhere—you're getting an Uber to get somewhere, you've got an iPad put in front of you when you're in a restaurant to order off the menu. It's just, as consumers, technology is everywhere. We've come to expect it.

    But when you walk into a hospital, some of that grinds to a halt. There's so many examples that you could apply in terms of how to make that access and process easy or more friendly for the patient as well as the clinicians if you think about various apps and particularly mobile apps.

    **Datica:** I would agree. Beyond mobile, which, as you framed it, is a very broad bucket, and in home care, which we touched on, are there some other areas that you see emerging?

    **Ms. Schade:** Yeah. We have a big initiative right now in one of our centers called, the acronym is MCIRCC, M-C-I-R-C-C. It's Michigan—always think of M as Michigan—Michigan Center for Integrative Research in Critical Care. This is an effort to capture clinical data off monitoring equipment on the patient and be able to predict potential complications or patient crashing, etc.

    I'm not going to do justice to it not being a clinician, but it's a very leading-edge area for us, and we're looking to partner with different vendors, third party vendors, some of whom have visual integration tools in terms of bringing all that information together for the clinician, in another case, companies that do work with sensor devices. Just another broad area in terms of innovation here.

    **Datica:** Technology seems to be a component of every discussion we have in some way, shape, or form. Looking internally at innovation or new initiatives, how do you see your role in IT supporting that?

    **Ms. Schade:** Let me give you an anecdote from my time at Brigham and then comment more generally here. At Brigham several years ago, we recognized that there was a huge backlog, if you will, of ideas for innovations that were never going to get to the top of the priority list when you look at standard IT budgets. We were able to get some funding separate from the CEOs funds, separate from the IT operating budget and capital budget to establish a program.

    We called it Health Innovation Program, I think, Brigham Health Innovation Program, or HIP. We had a twice a year cycle, we had a very formal process for submitting applications, evaluating them, and scoring them in deciding which ones we would fund. It was up to $100,000 per project that we were willing to fund, and then what we expected for those projects to come back in and present the results and a decision then to be made as to whether or not it's something that we should invest through the normal budget to scale, to full house, or is it something that was a good idea but not something that we were going to pursue.

    We did that program at Brigham while I was there. It was relatively successful. We don't have a program, that was through IT, we don't have a program like that here through IT. As I said, I think much of the innovation is being driven through the medical school and the faculty and the researchers. My role as the CIO, I have responsibility for the clinical care delivery, the hospitals and health centers. I don't have responsibility for the medical school and the research and education component. There's a separate IT department that manages that or supports that.

    I work very closely with those faculty as they are coming up with new projects, because they know that, ultimately, if they're going to scale, if they're going to run on the infrastructure, if they're going to integrate with our core systems, they've got to be talking to my staff and to me.

    The sooner that we can be in those discussions and help guide them and raise some of the issues that they're going to need to be concerned about, the better. As opposed to hearing that it's done, it's ready to go, can you just plug us in, or can you just roll it out whole house. I don't want to be the obstacle at that point, so I want to partner and know about it up front and help them as much as I can.

    I think one other thing I would comment on about sometimes a barrier around innovation, I already said in the anecdote about Brigham is, those aren't going to get to the top of the list and compete with the other core stuff you have to do. You have to have separate mechanisms, separate funding.

    What we found at Brigham was a challenge, is once those projects were approved, those innovation proposals were approved, then we'd have to get people to work on them, and we had to pull people from our staff who were working on the core project. Then we ended up with a resource issue. If we said you can use some of those funds to hire contract health to get it done, if, in fact, that innovation needed to integrate with our core systems, it still came back to needing our core IT staff.

    Those are just some of the challenges I think you face in trying to implement innovation programs. Ideally, what you want is it to be part of what you do and not a separate thing over here, like who's got good ideas, go to work on them. It needs to be part of the fiber of what you do. But I don't know too many organizations that have really accomplished that.

    **Datica:** I think you're right. It's really hard in healthcare with significant IT budgets, but there's also significant IT needs. We hear commonly that there's just not room in the IT budget for X number of years or months or whatever. It's interesting and it's novel.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/cx9ibt3hec" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Datica:** Shifting gears slightly, stepping outside of internal innovation and your experience at Brigham and Michigan, we work with a lot of smaller companies building new platforms for bundled payments, or telemedicine, whatever it might be.

    As a small IT company—not an Epic, right, not the big ones that we all know and love—but being a smaller organization, how do they go about selling to a clinical champion? Then, two, going through the IT integration process, security, compliance, all those pieces?

    **Ms. Schade:** How to do that and how to be successful?

    **Datica:** Yes.

    **Ms. Schade:** I think one thing that's critical is that they have a unique solution and that it's solving a real problem. To me, it's never technology for technology's sake. At the point that we understand that solution is solving X problem, and, yes, we, in fact, here at University of Michigan, do have X problem, we maybe didn't think we needed to address it yet, but here's an opportunity to do so—then I can be all ears.

    I think what's important is that they have a way to either sit on top of what, in a very kind of noninvasive way, are core systems and infrastructure, or they have clear integration path. That it does need to be, for example, any new product that needs to be integrated into our EHR, which happens to be Epic, that they've done it before, they have a way to do it, you know, so on and so forth, or that it really sits on top and maybe can have integration in a future phase.

    Back to what I said about the need to partner with those who are looking at innovation now within the organization. Startup companies probably come in all sorts of places within the organization. They're not calling the CIO going, _You know, we've got a product and we need to talk to you_. They're probably making inroads and getting people excited. Then I might hear about it, or my staff might hear about it down the road.

    My advice to those companies is the sooner you have engaged either directly the CIO, or had the folks that you are talking to in that organization, make sure that the CIO is aware and engaged, the better. Or IT will be in react mode and can, you know, put up some obstacles and slow it down.

    **Datica:** In a lot of ways, they're the same thing you're describing internally, like being involved as early as possible?

    **Ms. Schade:** Right.

    **Datica:** And to not be the road block. That's not necessarily what you want to be, but you need to understand that there's also a lot of considerations for you.

    **Ms. Schade:** Right. I talk about keeping the trains running, doing the core, day-to-day production, getting the systems in and keeping them running. I can't think of a CIO in the country that I know that only wants to be doing that. I think all of us want to be helping our organization fully leverage technology to solve real business problems and moving things forward. Don't view IT as that _big, bad, oh, they're going to stop us_, but as partners.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/d5autqzdp3" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Datica:** We're just about out of time. Was there anything else you wanted to add, Sue?

    **Ms. Schade:** Just to talk a little bit more about advice to startups, because I know that was one of the questions that you asked. When I start talking to any of those organizations, I want to know who their leaders are, who their founders are. I want to have a sense of how viable they are. Before I talk too seriously, I want to know they have capital backing.

    They need to find ways to understand healthcare, because I think you'd probably see a lot of good technologies from other industries coming in that could be applied to healthcare, so they need help sometimes understanding healthcare, which is important. I think they also need to understand that, especially an academic organization may be extremely complex. It might move slower than they want, but to have the patience to work with the organization if they're going to be successful.

    **Datica:** You're in a resource-constrained area, right?

    **Ms. Schade:** Right. Solve real problems that need to be solved. And we have plenty of problems to solve, don't get me wrong.

    **Datica:** I was going to say there's a good number to work on, so. All right. Fantastic. Greatly appreciate your time. This has been wonderful.

    **Ms. Schade:** Good. Fun to do. Thank you.

    **Datica:** Okay. Thank you so much, Sue.

  :summary: Esther Dyson, whose career includes journalist, author, businesswoman,
    commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and even backup cosmonaut, sat down
    for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD.
  :blog_lead: "This November, the [Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/podcast/)
    interviewed a very special industry guest. Due to audio difficulties, we chose
    to run a transcript of our fascinating conversation. \n\nEsther Dyson has worn
    many different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author,
    businesswoman, commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup
    cosmonaut. Esther sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In
    this interview, she shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital
    health success, the importance of security and privacy for digital health firms,
    and gave us an update on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American
    communities to use different measures to cultivate health and invest in the value
    wellness returns. "
  :post: "> Don't be afraid to try. Work under the assumption that it will work and
    if it doesn't work, figure out why. In a startup you are doing things people have
    never done before.\" - Esther Dyson \n\n## Q & A with Travis Good and Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis
    Good, MD:** _Esther, you’ve said in the past that as an angel investor you like
    to focus your investments on disease prevention versus technology around disease
    treatment. Can you tell us a bit more about that philosophy?_\n\n**Esther Dyson:**
    In general, you get a better return on keeping things working and investing in
    capacity than you do in trying to repair things that are broken. To some extent,
    people sometimes take that for granted. They do general maintenance to their cars
    and they conduct home maintenance, but often forget when it comes to their own
    bodies. People generally don't go to the doctor until they are sick and by that
    time, it is extremely expensive to try and fix the problem. It's expensive not
    just for you, but also for the healthcare system. It’s also expensive for your
    employer and you are probably less productive there. For individual investors
    and for society in general, it makes more sense to keep us healthy. Obviously,
    a big market exists for fixing people who are broken, but given that I have limited
    resources, I'd rather try to put the people who are trying to “fix what is broken”
    out of business by keeping everybody healthy.\n\n> Let’s start with the simple
    proposition that health is an asset. It might be our most important asset. And
    like any asset, if we cultivate it we increase the value it returns. We’re not
    talking about fixes when health is broken; those are important but they happen
    too late.\n— [Way To WellVille](http://www.wellville.net/about-wellville/)\n\n**Travis:**
    _I would agree that obviously prevention is the ideal path so that makes sense
    from an investment standpoint, as well. I want to shift gears to something you
    founded in 2013. You rebranded the Health Initiative Coordinating Council (HICCup)._\n\n<img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"Dyson - WaytoWellville-logo\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/KIxLr1iDGmiyYAi6cS4mG/d2080c6197ba94f2841c853c77015aac/Dyson_-_WaytoWellville-logo.png?w=400\"
    width=\"200\">\n\n**Esther:** In 2013, I founded Way to Wellville, which is a
    nonprofit and it does exactly what we are talking about. The investment pays off
    but the business model doesn't necessarily pay back to the investor, so that's
    why [Way to Wellville](http://hitconsultant.net/2015/02/12/esther-dysons-way-to-wellville-challenge/)
    is a nonprofit. We are trying to show the value of investing in health. Ultimately,
    governments, communities, and employers will realize there's a huge ROI. In 2014,
    we selected five communities from among 42 that applied. Now, the Wellville team
    of five are working with actual communities to help make them healthy. By the
    end of ten years, we hope to have enough success and visibility that we actually
    persuade other people to follow our path.\n\n> These are all real places with
    real people. They are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just
    places that have decided they would like a better future for their residents.
    [Wellville is] helping them build that for themselves.\n\n**Travis:** _My understanding
    is that the goal with these communities is to see which one could most improve
    five measures of health and economic vitality over a five year period. That was
    2014; we are almost in 2018 now. Could you update us on how that's going?_\n\n**Esther:**
    As I mentioned, we pivoted. It did start out as a contest, but it turned out the
    communities were not interested in beating one another, they really wanted to
    collaborate and learn from one another. It also became clear that ten years is
    a more realistic timeframe. Like any startup, we've morphed. It turns out that
    getting communities and community leader groups coordinated and organized has
    a long gestation period. It's very much like a startup; it takes a few years to
    build your team, try out an NVP, then discover that you need to change everything.
    We are now much more focused on children and parents and prevention of diabetes.
    If you can help the parents be better parents, or you change the children's experience
    positively, that's what's going to pay off best in the long run. \n\nDiscussions
    now center on [the opioid crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/truth-us-opioid-crisis-too-easy-blame-doctors-not-prescriptions);
    they keep talking about the drugs, but they should also be talking about why people
    are so vulnerable to these drugs. What makes them unable to resist? Not everybody
    who takes an opioid suddenly gets addicted, yet a number of people do and that's
    partly because their childhood was so insecure. It’s very hard if you've grown
    up not being able to trust the people around you. There's a lot of data on so-called
    adverse childhood experience that show direct correlation between that and addiction,
    unemployment, crime and all kinds of social ills. So we are trying to go upstream
    and address it from the start. \n\n**Travis:** _Are you working with the communities
    to define those measures and strategies, or are they coming to you?_\n\n**Esther:**
    We put out a call for applications in 2014. Forty-two communities applied; we
    picked five. Our role is like a personal trainer, or perhaps a startup coach.
    It's still the community that has to do the work; it’s their people; it's ultimately
    their achievement. We might eventually make ourselves unnecessary, but in the
    meantime, we can give them advice, introduce them to what the other communities
    are doing, introduce them to vendors and to potential funding sources. Way to
    Wellness was funded by me and I'd certainly love others to join, but the community
    projects are funded directly by funders, whether it is Medicaid, or philanthropy
    or a government grant; it's between those funders and the communities. It's theirs,
    not ours and we are not looking to be visible or recognized. We are looking for
    them to take on the responsibility, do the work, make a difference, train their
    own people and have something to be really proud of.\n\n**Travis:** _It's exciting
    to hear when people are working with communities, especially some small communities.
    What happens after that initial 10-year period?_\n\n**Esther:** The goal is to
    build something sustainable. Instead of, “Oh we have a class for 60 overweight
    women.” We want to hear, “We have now trained 30 dieticians and nutritional counselors,
    exercise coaches and they are community members, and they now have jobs and they
    are keeping those people healthy.”  This is the problem: Just as people get addicted
    to drugs, ironically, communities and nonprofits often get addicted to pilots.
    The pilots are great. We often hear, \"This pilot’s going to be really wonderful
    and we'll have a trial with 30 people.” The pilot works then we often hear \"We've
    run out of funding and the funders want to do something more innovative.\" We
    are not trying to do something innovative; we are trying to do something that
    works and then scale it. \n\nWhen Walmart opens a store, they are not running
    a pilot to see if the store works. If the store somehow isn't working, they find
    a new manager, they do more training, but they don't say, \"Oh, the concept of
    this really doesn't work.\" We are trying to get that kind of accountability.
    These programs work, if effective people are brought in, screened and trained.
    People need transportation, as well. There are lots of local challenges that you
    need to overcome. There's no magic here; there's simply implementation, persistence,
    and being in it for the long-term, versus \"we'll get some results and then see
    what happens.\" \n\n**Travis:** _As you were talking through that in terms of
    building something that is sustainable, real, and can scale, I imagine that's
    the same thing you would say to some of the companies that you invest in and how
    they should view pilots._\n\n**Esther:** Yes, very much. Don't be afraid to try.
    Work under the assumption that it will work and if it doesn't work, figure out
    why. In a startup you are doing things people have never done before. People have
    done diabetes prevention programs before. They have trained communities better.
    What we are not doing is coming to these communities and doing exotic research
    and turning people into specimens. We are helping them do things that typically
    don't scale. Instead of doing something that is often different, you are trying
    to do something new that hasn't been tried before and learn from failing. In our
    communities, you learn from failing. Maybe we need to train people better or maybe
    we didn't market this program effectively enough or we need to provide some type
    of incentive or we need to provide child care so that people can attend the course,
    because hey, they don't have childcare — what a surprise! It's those kinds of
    things.\n\n> It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need to
    make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't understand
    that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals. Many companies
    think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how to actually get
    it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.\" -Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis:**
    _I want to shift gears a little and talk about one of the company that you are
    invested in, I read something about a merger between Digi.me and Personal. In
    terms of joining forces, they are looking to address the challenges around enhancing
    privacy with healthcare data. But at the same time, enabling people to share and
    potentially combine and analyze data. As you think about your investment there,
    can you share your thoughts on the importance that must be made by healthcare
    IT companies on privacy and security?_\n\n**Esther:** Privacy and security are
    really important but to some extent, there are regular privacy breaches, which
    is an issue to fix. Privacy and [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    often obstruct good healthcare. What you need for good healthcare is to know more
    about the person, not just their result on a particular test. Where do they live?
    What is their income level? In case of opioids, have they applied for drugs at
    any other place? Do they have multiple sources of supply? It’s not a complicated
    thing, it's having both security, privacy and effective data sharing. That's what
    is challenging. It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need
    to make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't
    understand that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals.
    Many companies think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how
    to actually get it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.
    \n\n**Travis:** _How do you advise companies to help them navigate that path towards
    implementing the solution and into the workflow of the health system?_\n\n**Esther:**
    I'm generally pretty skeptical. I was just at the doctor earlier this week and
    had blood tests. I got the tests back and they were in a PDF. What I'd really
    like to see is my FitBit data and other personal data, to determine how the blood
    tests changed over time. What I had was a long list of PDFs from various dates
    that were completely useless. Part of the problem is that most of these institutions
    are using large legacy mainframe systems that are incredibly cumbersome. You really
    start to think: \"Throw this all out and start fresh.\" That's what a number of
    vendors are doing but of course, it is very hard to replace the huge installs
    of these systems. \n\nI'm on the board of a company called Wellpass, and invested
    in quite a few others, including 4D Healthware, Healthcelerate, [HealthLoop](https://datica.com/customer/healthloop/),
    Vital Score. They all sell into healthcare systems, and need to understand how
    they work. I don't think a twenty-two year old who just graduated from Stanford
    can know how to fix the healthcare system. You need to have someone that has actually
    worked in a hospital or an insurance company on your team. That's not just so
    you have contacts, but more importantly so that you understand the context, how
    the system works, how the data actually flows. I went to a continuing medical
    education conference once; they had this table where they were handing out medical
    advice for doctors. There was a stack of stapled handouts — twenty-five sheets
    each, double-sided, so fifty pages per handout. Each page was a spreadsheet about
    some particular thing the doctor should do with their patient during the patient
    interview — which of course lasts max fifteen minutes. As a doctor, they are probably
    spending eight or nine minutes typing and and five minutes actually talking. Now
    here’s this sheet of fifty things they are supposed to be doing; some of them
    they’re already doing, and some are only for teenagers and or for women. But you,
    as a vendor, you have to understand that you are either replacing one of those
    fifty things, or adding to them. Do you really understand that context? Can you
    fit into it or make it better with your extra page? Of course, some things are
    for the administrator, or the nurse discharging patients. But whatever your tool
    does, how does it make those people’s lives better and easier? \n\nThat's the
    challenge. Healthcare is a very cumbersome and change-resistant marketplace. The
    companies that have been the most successful are the ones that are eroding things
    around the edges. I love this marketplace because it is interesting and important
    but, if you want to be in this marketplace, you need to understand the challenges.\n\n**Travis:**
    _As we think of how to augment, expand, extend, or in some way work with the EHR
    and EHR data — taking that data and transform it into something a bit more meaningful
    than a CCD or some big PDF — I'm curious what you are finding there._\n\n**Esther:**
    One company out there called PicnicHealth will take your medical records and automatically
    parse them as much as they can and then have humans do the rest. They will have
    people on the phone calling to get your medical documents from all these different
    vendors or different providers and they will make them all into one piece that
    is intelligible. That is really an exciting proposition. As I was just talking
    about my blood draws, I realized I should just call them up and see how they are
    doing and use the service. \n\nThe challenge, of course, is that there are so
    many different varieties and layouts. There is an accepted medical vocabulary
    but there are always little exceptions here and there. A blood value is not something
    you want to get wrong. For the patient, but also for the doctor, you want to make
    sure that if you are comparing data from multiple sources, you want to make sure
    the data is absolutely consistent across all these different sources. It's a challenge
    and there is both a real danger to people and real liability to companies if they
    do it wrong. So, it's going to be a slow process. The more standardized things
    get, the better. Whether you are on a Mac or a PC, we can amazingly have this
    conversation, across different kinds of computers and it is working, more or less.
    \n\n**Travis:** _It is interesting to see how different companies are approaching
    that challenge, both from a consumer standpoint and from FHIR and direct-to-consumer
    enablement authorization of data._\n\n**Esther:** At one end, somebody like [Apple
    and HealthKit](https://datica.com/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-healthcare/)
    is really fostering that. It’s possible; consider how it happened in banking,
    with Intuit. They had this tool Quicken that would let individual bank customers
    interact with their bank portals. Intuit started by reverse-engineering the interfaces
    of a couple of big banks - probably Citibank and BankAmerica (I’m not sure) -
    so users of those banks could download their own data and manage it for themselves,
    even consolidating data from multiple accounts. At first, the banks were very
    resistant but after the first two or three were done, and the customers started
    engaging more with their banks, the other banks noticed. They started saying,
    \"Wow, they are not losing their customers; in fact, those banks are getting even
    more buy-in from their customers. We want this, too.\" They went to Intuit and
    said, \"Please do an API [application program interface] for us.” Suddenly the
    dynamics had changed. Intuit came back and said, “If you want to hook up your
    banks to us, then you have to do the work, but sure, we'd be glad to let you address
    our customer base.” With luck, that's what's going to happen in healthcare. There
    are going to be a lot of vendors now that are interested in working with HealthKit
    and other intermediaries. You are beginning to get this widespread recognition
    that, of course, individuals should be able to see their Fitbit data matched against
    their RunKeeper data and someday matched against blood draws and all the other
    stuff.\n\n**Travis:** _I want to follow up on something else you said. There's
    been a ton of investment in the digital healthcare space over the last five to
    ten years. You mentioned about having someone with experience on the actual care
    side. Can you share two or three consistent success threads that help take a startup
    from a seed investment up through multiple series, from A to B to C?_\n\n**Esther:**
    Basically it all comes down to the team. You need to know something; you need
    to work together effectively; but then you need to be willing to learn and change
    into it; be agile and be humble and all this kind stuff. It's really the attitude
    of “I love what I'm doing, I'm learning from what I'm doing and I'm responding
    to what I'm learning.” Then, it helps if you have a good idea and you are working
    with interesting problems. There are lots of specifics to health or healthcare
    but the fundamental things that make startups successful are pretty much the same.
    \n\n**Travis:** _Curious on team, and investing in team, as you look at presentations
    and pitch decks, do you have an opinion on an ideal team or an ideal mix of people
    on a team that you like to see and you like to invest in._\n\n**Esther:** Very
    clearly, it doesn't consist of the three best people in the world, it consists
    of the best team of three or four, or whatever. A lot of people miss one out of
    the three or four, but you need someone with medical industry knowledge and connections;
    you need someone with technical capacity to build what you need; you need someone
    who understands, whether it is the consumer or the healthcare system that you
    are selling into; but, you also need someone who understands the user proposition,
    especially in healthcare where often the payer is not the same as the user. The
    payer may be the insurance company or the individual, but it may be that the payer
    is the hospital, but the user is a doctor or a nurse. \n\nIt goes back to the
    old software industry, where there was this wonderful set of companies called
    value-added resellers (VARs). They would take the product and go find a corporate
    customer. They would train the IT department and help IT install the software.
    Then they would train the users — the employees making phone calls or doing accounting
    or customer support. The VARs understood it was their problem to make the buyers
    — and the buyers’ employees — like the product. Without VARs, the software vendors'
    customers would usually pilot the software and think it was great, but then they
    would buy it and find out they couldn't get their employees to use it. The vendor
    got the money the first few times and started getting bad references for the product.\n\nI
    think we need a better understanding of the role of VARs (or whatever you want
    to call them these days) in the healthcare market. Whether it’s a third-party
    VAR or your own sales support, you need someone who understands how the hospital
    works, or how the insurance company works to insert their product into the workflow
    and actually make it useful and make the end-user customer say, \"Oh my gosh,
    this makes my job so much easier. I can do referrals automatically instead of
    having to handwrite something on a piece of paper and give it to my nurse and
    she puts it on my desk and it gets lost and I don't get the referral back and
    forth with the other doctors.\" And, of course, the patient doesn't get the benefit
    of going to see the dermatologist.\n\n**Travis:** _Before we conclude the interview,
    Esther, I wanted to ensure we covered everything on the Way to Wellville so that
    we didn’t miss anything there._\n\n**Esther:** Well, I did want to mention [the
    five Wellville communities](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/), just in case
    in case anybody listening either lives in one of them or is nearby. The Wellville
    partner in Muskegon County, Michigan, which is the one that I work with most closely,
    is called [1 in 21](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/muskegon-michigan/).
    The Wellville partner in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is called [Spartanburg’s
    Way to Wellville](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/spartanburg-south-carolina/).
    There's [Hope Rising](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/lake-county-california/)
    in Lake County, California, which is just north of Silicon Valley. There's [Way
    to Wellville: Clatsop County](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/clatsop-county-oregon/),
    northwest of Portland, Oregon. And there's the [Triple Aim Collaborative](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/north-hartford-connecticut/)
    in North Hartford, Connecticut. These are all real places with real people. They
    are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just places that have
    decided they would like a better future for their residents. We are helping them
    build that for themselves. You can find us at [wellville.net](http://www.wellville.net).\n\n**Travis:**
    _Wonderful. Thank you for joining us today, Esther._\n\n**Esther:** Likewise,
    it was great. Thank you very much. \n\n<div class=\"callout callout--gray-light

  :summary: 'Dr. Molly Coye joined us to talk about UCLA''s innovation process through
    the topic _"Doer, thinker, delegator: Why all three traits drive decision making
    that sustains organizational change."_ We learned a great deal about the full
    life cycle of innovation adoption—from sourcing to evaluating to implementing
    to operationalizing. Come check this interview out for a candid glimpse into one
    of the nation''s best innovation programs.'
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Innovations can come from within an organization, but often comes from outside. It is equally critical to create processes to discover innovations from both sources.
    2. Getting the word out organizationally has been important to UCLA's ongoing success. Several methods have lead to this, but two to highlight are broad organizational participation, and focused innovation owners sprinkled throughout the organization, whether MDs, MBAs, or otherwise.
    3. The fundability of a startup has a huge impact as to whether its innovation will be adopted by an academic medical center. Evaluators are thinking three years out, and if there isn't a high degree of certainty that company will be around, chances are the product or service won't be purchased.

    **Catalyze:** Dr. Coye, thank you for joining us today. It really is exciting to talk to you about what you're doing at UCLA and then we'll touch on some work more globally around innovation.

    First, I wanted to kind of get a sense, because innovation groups, digital innovation groups, are not necessarily a new thing, but they tend to sort of fall into different areas within bigger organizations like UCLA. So I was curious where you and your innovation groups fit within the broader organization.

    _[Earlier in the interview, Dr. Coye had issues with an errant computer notification sound. We apologize for the interruptions. It clears up shortly after the interview starts. —Ed.]_

    **Dr. Coye:** The first thing is, in most academic medical centers, for a long time, there have been tech transfer offices. Basically, these were offices that took inventions that the faculty came up with and helped them commercialize those inventions. Many times people think that that's what innovation is, in an academic medical center. And ours was really one of the first of a new breed, about five years ago, which focused on innovation as essentially scanning for product and services out there, most of the commercial ones that you could bring in house and really transform care very rapidly. So that's a different purpose. Maybe 10% or 20% of what we try to use and spread comes from our own UCLA inventions. The majority are things that are commercial products and services externally.

    **Catalyze:** That is really interesting, because we talked to a lot of academic centers where innovation is just sort of a new branding for tech transfer. But, yes, essentially the same mission, and it's only about, like you said, 10% to 20% that's internal, and much bigger percentage being external that you guys are coming in and using to transform care at UCLA.

    **Dr. Coye:** There's a very good reason for this. If you're in another sector, if you're a car manufacturer, or you're Google, you may be 20%, 30%, 40% of the market, but it's very fragmented. Even the $2 or $3 billion health enterprise delivery system can't invent all the things that are needed, so you really have to have a process where you can scan externally and bring in external innovations.

    **Catalyze:** Very interesting. Where is it within IT—within operations or it's own bucket? I'm just trying to assess within the organizational structure, where the innovation group would fit.

    **Dr. Coye:** Basically, we report directly to the Chief Executive. We're not inside IT, and we're not inside operations. A lot of places have said if you bury innovation, it will get killed by the usual processes internally.

    We not only are in the executive suite and a direct report to the CEO of the health system, but we also have what's called a fast track for pilots, where we actually can get all the usual processes, Legal, Compliance, IT, Quality and Safety impact, etc., we can get a very rapid vetting in order to be able to move forward, rather than getting drowned in the usual process, because health systems, at least from our point of view, are relatively bureaucratic, and it will kill innovation's chance.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/qh5euy75zp" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** We had a conversation with somebody, maybe at University of Washington, where they had talked about innovation around research and some of the challenges they've had getting a new technology through the process of compliance and security and legal and all of these other things. They were talking about it in the context of within an IRB timeline. It's interesting that you have that ability within your group, just based on where it is within the organization, to fast track certain things, because I do think those bottlenecks exist.

    That leads me to a research question. UCLA is a large academic medical center, and research is a big part of what UCLA does. Within the context of innovation, how do you see research and innovation fitting together? Adding on to that, how do you think about establishing an evidence base for these new innovative technologies or new delivery services that you guys are testing at UCLA?

    **Dr. Coye:** Here it's not a brand new innovation. Something that still isn't dominant in the field is very important. That is, rather than having to do randomized control trials with huge numbers, doing what's called rapid-cycle evaluation. It's more like the lean approach to innovation. It says when you start out with your pilot for innovation, you always want to have an evaluation laid out. You want to know the targets, the metrics, definition of success, and what would cause you to pull the plug on it. And then you're beginning to track that within six weeks to ten weeks of kicking off your pilot.

    Depending on the thing that you're testing, you may declare victory within three months of starting it. People who are listening to this should understand there's a big difference between a new pharmaceutical or biotechnology or imaging device versus IT and service innovations. The IT and service innovations you're less likely to do severe damage. It's more a question of, _Are you able to bring about the positive changes that you want to? Are you seeing something un-looked for that's a problem?_ This rapid-cycle evaluation is what we use at UCLA, and it's increasingly what people are using to evaluate innovations.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/jl9ys1j3cd" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Is there any way you could walk through a specific use case, or a specific example of a service that you've gone through that process? Maybe starting with a small pilot, and then within whatever time frame declaring victory and then deploying more widely.

    **Dr. Coye:** We're an unusual academic medical center because we have a lot of primary care. In our primary care clinics, we wanted to test out having care coordinators that were not nurses but actually medical assistants or people from the community, social workers that had a short period of training and worked with the doctors directly to try and help the patients do whatever they needed to do. We set it up with collection of metrics of the numbers of patients that they were helping each week. Then we were looking at the number of times the patients visited the emergency room or were admitted for hospitalization.

    Over the first three months, we could see a very positive impact. We got people involved in the project team who would be from the next, this was in five clinics, who would be in the next five clinics. They learned the process as we were finishing the pilot with the first five clinics, and had a chance to ask questions and see it operating. So when we got to the point that we were sure this was working, we would start rolling it out very fast.

    As a matter of fact, the word had spread to other clinics, so we had to accept nine clinics for the 2nd wave. Then it went out through the rest of our 33 clinics in less than 2 years. They were able to build their oversight of the process and their commitment to it, instead of waiting and then coming to them and saying, look we've got this great thing, and we want to sell you on it, and starting from scratch over again.

    **Catalyze:** Wow, 33 primary care clinics. That's impressive. In two years, even more impressive. Was that an internal initiative, one of those 10% to 20% that was something that you wanted to test internally?

    **Dr. Coye:** Yes, it was.

    **Catalyze:** How did these community care navigators interfacing with patients integrate within the heath system, from a data collection and communications standpoint?

    **Dr. Coye:** Their titles are Care Coordinators. Basically, we would think of them as clinic-based as opposed to community health workers that are principally in the community. That is a fundamental difference. We had to create a new job category for them. We had to define their characteristics and capabilities, and the hiring basis. We developed a short curriculum. It's only a couple of weeks of training. But then ongoing supervision and the criteria for advancement, etc. We really did have to integrate it into the labor force of UCLA and the UC Health System.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1a44c07t0b" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** How do you translate or spread the word? There are things like presentations at conferences, but how do you go about commercializing or spreading the word about that model?

    **Dr. Coye:** You're raising a very good question because if it were a commercial product, then obviously we would have gotten investors and gone through the process of trying to take it to market. And one of the biggest problems in the U.S. is that you have millions of successful pilots within a delivery system, or even something that's been successfully deployed across a large delivery system that never really get disseminated beyond that. There are two things we're doing. In the short run, the University of California has five medical centers. They collaborate on a regular basis, sharing their best practices.

    As soon as they heard about this, they all got excited. Now the rest of the UC medical centers are going through a methodical process of instituting their version of what we're doing. We also, as you said, are doing presentations. There are two articles about this coming out in the literature very shortly. But the second thing we did is to develop the Global Lab for help, and so if you'd like, I can give a few minutes about that, because that's essentially created as a platform for disseminating information about innovations that reduce the cost of care and improve access.

    **Catalyze:** Yeah, I'd actually love to hear more about the Global Lab.

    **Dr. Coye:** Okay. Well, so for the folks that may be listening to this, the website is [www.globallabforhealth.org](http://www.globallabforhealth.org), and it's a nonprofit site. Anyone can go to that site and post an innovation. It gives information about innovations and displays it in a way that's searchable. You could go to the website and say, well, I want to see all of the care coordinators, or find a solution for readmissions, and come up with tiles, essentially. It's like playing cards in a sense of different innovations, and choose the ones that you want to go in more depth. It has very deep information.

    One of the things that's very new and doesn't exist on other websites is that we then have information from the case studies of where it's been used. We contact the users of the innovation to see how it worked out for them. We're going to be doing a challenge on March 2nd. It will be open for about a month and a half. Catholic Health Association, which are all the Catholic hospitals and SNFs and home care agencies around the country, to see what their members have been using with the best results for population health management.

    **Catalyze:** Wow, interesting. First question, is that a challenge that you guys are doing on your own, the Global Lab, or are you doing it as part of sort of some of the work that the government and HHS are doing around challenges?

    **Dr. Coye:** No, this is just us with the Catholic Health Association.

    **Catalyze:** Okay, and then my next question, the Global Lab, all the sort of pilots and different listings of projects and things where people can go and search on the website, are those both commercial as well as noncommercial like that example that you gave?

    **Dr. Coye:** Yeah, they are both commercial and noncommercial, and right now there are probably about 120 innovations on there. Actually, I would say the larger number of them are ones that are service innovations that a health system or a hospital or a medical group has come up with. But as more commercial entrepreneurs find out about this, I think we'll start to see much more of the commercial innovations posted as well.

    **Catalyze:** At Catalyze, we work with a lot of commercial innovators building new digital health services and different technologies for bundled payments, and some of the stuff you talked about. It would be particularly interesting to get the word out to more people, because I think that is some of the struggle. You can publish case studies on your own site or try to give presentations at events, but it's hard, right? And there are so many of these things going on.

    **Dr. Coye:** We are aware of lots of young companies that have terrific products and services, and I know that the whole marketing process in this fragmented health system is really, really tough. This is a way for them to get the word out. We're excited about it. And a lot of the investors are excited about it because they see it as a way for their portfolio companies to get to market more easily, too.

    **Catalyze:** Are there other partners that are part of the Global Lab or are you guys looking for partners, whether they be investors or health systems, or whatever they might be?

    **Dr. Coye:** We're still in formation, but we have some core partners now. NEHI based in Boston, which is the Network for Excellence in Healthcare Innovation, and they tend to do more research in policy work. They're a big partner with us. We're also collaborating with Avia, which is a company that you may know about. We're currently talking with a number of other partners like that. Then there are a lot of other partners, like investors and researchers, who are coming up with new information about how effective innovations are. This is the kind of thing that can only benefit if we get lots of people involved. Those interested in partnering can go to the website and see how to do it.

    **Catalyze:** How does an organization like UCLA, or your group within UCLA, go about scanning and discovering new services and products?

    **Dr. Coye:** In past there wasn't a Global Lab, there wasn't a place to go to see everything that was going on. What you could do was just develop the best network you can. For the last three years, we also have been running the National Healthcare Innovation Summit. It was in D.C. in 2013, and in '14, it was in Boston, and this year it's going to be in Chicago. That is an opportunity where we get to see, we have a gallery and a showcase, and we get to see lots of innovations. But we work with California Healthcare Foundation that does a lot of investing in companies that are producing products for the safety net. We have an investor forum of about 20 to 25 VCs that come to UCLA and talk about trends. So we reach out as widely as we can.

    **Catalyze:** Like the California Healthcare Foundation, you're definitely hitting on the brands that are making interesting investments in the space, and California Healthcare Foundation with companies like Propeller, DirectDerm, and some of the others that we know.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/9pcre3wyco" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** When I read the title of the Global Lab for Innovation, I was thinking globally—international health. There are a lot of interesting innovations and things happening internationally, which are forced by resource constraints. Is there an opportunity for international innovators and new international projects and services to also be listed there that we can learn from?

    **Dr. Coye:** There definitely is, and we've already funded some groups in India to work on collecting innovations there to post. We held a big meeting about two weeks ago on reverse innovation, which is basically the concept of scanning in the developing world for solutions because they use less resources to accomplish good purposes, and then trying to see how they can be adapted here.

    The truth is, as we've dug into this for the last couple of years, and I've been to India looking at a bunch of the solutions there, is that if you think about it, for the companies in South Africa or Kenya or India or Sri Lanka or in a lot of these countries, they don't really expect that they're going to sell a product or a service in the U.S. or in Western Europe, in most cases. Occasionally, especially if it's an IT enabled device, it's the kind that might actually make the jump.

    In most cases, they don't have a lot of reason to want to post on our site because it's not like they're going to go and sell in the U.S. It's much more a question of us going out and scanning and finding the things that should get posted, so that people in the U.S. or Britain or Western Europe can understand what is possible with lower resources. I have some pretty good groups that are working on that now, it's just that the word of it isn't getting out in the U.S.

    We're forming partnerships with them. There's a group at Duke called IPIHD. There's a group in D.C. called the Center for Health Market Innovations. There's another one called [ACCESS Health International](http://www.accessh.org/). And they're working in these other countries, mainly helping those companies develop their own businesses in that market. We are now piggybacking and bringing that information here to the U.S. There will be global information, but not by the same model, not because individual companies went on and posted.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uiid4hjcg8" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** A few years ago, before it got as big as it is now with the mobile health or the mHealth Summit, when the National Institute of Health owned it, there was much more of that international focus. That has changed now. National Institute of Health is still involved, but it doesn't seem to be quite as big, or at least as much of a proportion as it used to be of that conference.

    **Dr. Coye:** I think that's true, and part of it is probably because some of the basic principles used in less-developed countries in developing products and services, we have actually started to incorporate. A lot of new products and services developed in the U.S. are much more disruptive. They're really based on, I mean, I don't know if they saw it another country, but they're similar kinds of principles for the development.

    **Catalyze:** There definitely has been a significant shift in what companies here are developing and how much they look like what maybe were previous to them internationally.

    **Catalyze:** Other than a small commercial entity, a small company wanting to expose itself maybe on the Global Lab website so that others can find it and maybe, if they're interested, to engage with that company, are there other suggestions you have for those smaller vendors?

    **Dr. Coye:** There are now lots of incubators and accelerators that aren't listed. There's actually a great report on them out from the California Healthcare Foundation that just came out about two months ago. People can go to [www.chcf.org](http://www.chcf.org) and see the report on incubators and accelerators.

    It helps to have essentially a body, a group, like an innovator or an accelerator, that is advising you and helping you make the contacts and go to sale. And one of the things that that report found is that a lot of the innovators and accelerators are now shifting their attention, so they're following the company for two or three years rather than the old three-month or six-month cycle. They realize how much of this is helping them actually get into the market. I think that's very positive.

    **Catalyze:** You mentioned it before, we know Avia pretty well. We're in Madison, and they're in Chicago. It seems like they started with that premise, that model, where it's not going to be a three-month program, but we're going to try to build both sides, where we have these health centers that are looking for these services, and then we have these companies that are building these services, and we're going to try and build these long-term relationships, connect both sides.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/i5cvjlwfqp" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Shifting focus and looking specifically at your organization and innovation within your organization, how do you operate practically within that and maintain a broader vision for how do you transform care at UCLA?

    **Dr. Coye:** It's similar to leadership on any topic in a large organization. We have to have a very clear message about the vision and targets that you're shooting for, that over the course of at least the first year or so, a lot of people could repeat that, and they know what you're trying to aim for. Then any individual innovation that you adopt can be understood in terms of what you're trying to accomplish. So what we did, which was then a little bit unusual, is we actually took the strategy for UCLA Health, and we said, okay, what types of innovations could advance that best?

    And we decided there were four buckets of innovations. One was telemedicine innovations. Another was, in a larger sense, anything to improve access, accessibility to maintenance services, convenience, things like that. A third one was to make primary care go upstream and be more preventive and more comprehensive. And then the fourth thing for an academic medical center is to help with the management of very complex cases so that the ones that actually did need to be in the hospital could come and get the care, but a lot of times the pre- and post-care can be done in their own communities, in their own homes.

    By focusing on those and having a message that said, _We're heading towards value-based care and population health_, now I would say a fairly good share of the mid-level management and executive management totally understands that's what we're trying to do.

    We've run contests internally. We have one-fifth of all the 10,000 employees here vote in the last election. They are involved in thinking about it and getting a chance to learn what this vision is.

    **Catalyze:** How do you spread the word to such a large organization? How do you get them to speak up and participate and identify problems and potential ideas for solutions that are coming from the ground up?

    **Dr. Coye:** We have done the contest. That is a really good way because all different departments and units get involved in that, and a lot of workers are voting, so that really helps. A second thing is that we have innovation officers in a lot of our units and programs throughout UCLA. So there is an innovation officer in the ED, and an innovation officer in the primary care group, and an innovation officer in Urology.

    These are people who are responsible for helping spread the concepts and identify promising innovations, or do a pilot if we see something from the outside that ought to be piloted. That's been very effective, too. And then a third thing is we've had a lot of speakers at events. You know, in a sense, I think the innovation officers is the only thing that's sort of unusual, or innovative, in what we're doing, and I think it's been pretty successful.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/o9c7ncs5mg" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** That was the one that kind of caught my attention as we were going through the list of different things that you do. A lot of them are MDs. There are some who come from IT. Is there a typical profile for an innovation officer in the urology group, versus the orthopedics group, versus the whatever group?

    **Dr. Coye:** We have quite a mix. Of the 12 or 13 we have now, I think 2 or 3 are nurses, and probably 4 or 5 of them are administrators in the sense that they are an MBA or a MHA rather than a physician. So there's quite a good mix. The one thing I would say is that we have chosen people who are pretty well integrated into management already. These are not like the most junior people. They are people who already have responsibility and are sort of mid-level.

    They are looked to as leaders in their own organizations or units enough that people will listen to them and are interested in what they think. And I think that's valuable, because while it's nice to take somebody who's very young and doesn't have any standing yet, and then they have the best ideas in many cases, it's hard for them especially in an academic department, to necessarily get heard.

    **Catalyze:** Do they meet regularly with you, or how does that communication work?

    **Dr. Coye:** No, we tend to meet around once a month, and then they go as a group to several conferences during the year. Not always all of them can go, but so they will all go to the National Healthcare Innovation Summits, and some of them are going to HIMSS and the HX360. And a lot of them are going to other innovation conferences like Blueprint. We also circulate readings to them, and it's been, and they send us suggestions of things that we should do, because these are very active leaders already in the organization. They're not shy once they get dug in on it.

    **Catalyze:** They're out going to these conferences. They're also in their specific clinical groups or specialty groups. They're identifying innovations that they might want to pilot within Urology or Orthopedics, etc. Then they bring that back, and you rapidly assess. Is that how the process works?

    **Dr. Coye:** Yeah, it definitely is. One other thing I forgot to mention we've done that is also different is we worked very hard in the first two or three years to stand up and identify an approach to transformation. A graph that lays out the process that everybody in the organization, down to sort of low management level, has seen applied and used. It describes, here's the role of innovation, here's the role of transformation, here's the process for deploying something in operations from transformation.

    That's now been used for 19 different change initiatives within the organization. I'm not talking small pilots. I'm talking about major changes in tertiary, quaternary care. One of the elements in the innovation part of that is what we call patient voice, which is medical ethnography, to understand the variance around an area, an opportunity, or something that you're going to change.

    That has become very important, because that's sort of the way we can hook our star to that. You know, we can sort of say, well, innovation actually has a definition in every one of those 19 initiatives. There's what innovation is supposed to be doing, integrated into the understanding of change throughout the organization.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/lb1pr4zm5k" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Interesting. Some big organizations have a new title or a position, like Chief Clinical Transformation Officer. Is that a specific area of transformation? Do you have a Clinical Transformation Officer, or does that all sort of fall under innovation?

    **Dr. Coye:** We recently, about a year ago, recruited a new Chief Medical and Quality Officer, and I was very disappointed because I wanted him to be Chief Transformation Officer because. There are a lot of ways to cut the pie. I like the model that I'm familiar with from Geisinger and a bunch of other places, which is that you have a very small innovation group. Our ambition is not to have more than ten people in terms of on the staff of innovation, plus the officers. And then you need a larger capability to really roll something out across operations in a really big way.

    In some places that's called a Transformation Department, and it has IT and Finance and change management like lean capabilities, and data, and a whole bunch of other pieces to it. We're not like Kaiser, I mean, we're not like Geisinger. We don't have a Chief Transformation Officer and an organized transformation unit that way. What we've done instead is say, well, then there's going to be a big change management effort, this is what you have to assemble. It's that process. So I think we will see more and more places saying, here's the Chief Transformation Officer, meaning this is the person who operationalizes change.

    **Catalyze:** It seems it started at places like Geisinger, but we're starting to see it at more bigger, more academic centers, more organizations, much more commonly. It also makes sense to shift it a little bit. I feel like a couple of years ago, when they first started, they were just basically trying to convince physicians to use e-prescribing.

    **Dr. Coye:** There's a certain thing to that, yeah. It's sort of ironic because our CEO just announced that he's been recruited to Geisinger as CEO to replace Glenn Steele at Geisinger. He'll now have a chance to go to an organization that actually has a Chief Transformation Officer. We'll see how he feels about that.

    **Catalyze:** I wanted to jump back to a couple of things related to some of the things you mentioned at the start. Is the innovation group or UCLA also thinking, or does it also participate, in investments of internal or external pilots and projects?

    **Dr. Coye:** We haven't until recently, because it was pretty hard in the University of California structure as a state institution to do that. But actually, the business school and the broader campus have set up some new incubators on campus. The university can actually make investments, take equity in new ways. And so they become more of a possibility down the road. Up until now, our office has not been doing that so much. I have a background as an adviser to venture and equity investors, so when we're looking at new companies coming in, we pay a lot of attention into how strong the company is, how good the management is, how likely they are to continue getting funded, etc. But we're not doing actual investments ourselves.

    **Catalyze:** It's particularly interesting that you assess the fundability, which for some of these companies is how they're going to be here in a couple of years. I've actually never heard anybody say that's part of their assessment process.

    **Dr. Coye:** It would be pretty crazy. I mean, you can look at something, and, boy it really helps patients manage their medications. But the company has no funding, or they have a CEO that no investor would ever fund that kind of thing. That's not going to help you to go do all that work and then wind up with your hands empty.

    **Catalyze:** I agree 100% with you. Maybe it's partly because you have a background advising private and venture equity that you bring that perspective. I think it makes a ton of sense. Do you guys also work with companies which aren't funded yet, or are sort of pre-funded, like really early companies?

    **Dr. Coye:** Not much. Our time horizon is shorter than BC. We're basically saying we want to have anything we work with, be able to have a broad deployment and big effect within our health system within three years. So that means that we're mostly looking for what you would say a series B or C, meaning looking for a company where they have their first two to ten customers as reference customers that can demonstrate that this actually works, and what's the business model, and all the rest of it. The best sweet spot is that they are not already, sort of hell bent for leather. I mean, for example, by the time we might have thought of doing something with Castlight, they were practically doing their IPO. You know, that was a little late.

    **Catalyze:** Or Castlight's IPO was a little early, I guess.

    **Dr. Coye:** The way you look at it, yeah.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/t2rrsrzzz1" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** That hump is a big hump from my perspective working with other companies, getting to that two to ten enterprise and having good reference customers is a significant challenge. There is a lot of de-risking that has happened by the time they get to you, if they're at that stage.

    **Dr. Coye:** Right.

    **Catalyze:** Yeah, and if you guys are looking for impact within three years, it's pretty hard for a very early, never-had-a-pilot-before funding.

    **Dr. Coye:** And we have fabulous science and technology that's  on that pathway of transfer here at UCLA. Our Wireless Health Institute has got computer-based technologies that are now becoming young companies, and they're doing really well, and that's tremendously exciting. But that's a different kind of enterprise, from being healthcare within a health system. That's why the difference in attitude or orientation.

    **Catalyze:** It's really interesting to see how you guys approach innovation at UCLA and how it is so immediate results driven.

    I don't really have any additional questions. Do you have anything that you'd like to add?

    **Dr. Coye:** Well, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to describe the Global Lab. I'd just like to say the address one more time. The URL is [www.globallabforhealth.org](http://www.globallabforhealth.org). Please, for anybody listening who is either an investor and has portfolio companies, or who has an innovation that could be a service innovation developed by a delivery system or a health plan, it's free to go and post your innovation, and we would be very excited to see it. And look for our challenge on March 2nd with health associations. So thank you. This has been a really fun conversation, too.

    **Catalyze:** We really appreciate your time. Maybe we will end up crossing paths in person at some point at one of these events and conferences.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
