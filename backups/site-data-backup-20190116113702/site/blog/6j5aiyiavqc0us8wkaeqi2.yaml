:summary: Private, Public, and Hybrid clouds all exist in healthcare. Hybrid clouds
  represent the largest area of growth in healthcare organizations.
:blog_lead: |-
  Last week we published our [inaugural quarterly report looking at innovation and transformation within healthcare](/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/). A lot of great insights are jam-packed into the journal, but perhaps the most interesting is the infographic comparing cloud trends over the last three years.

  <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf" title="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" rel="external">
  <img src="https://images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1OrH0GVvn2iAaqGuOMi66U/65b0f7f0407c6229bca3561517303c53/report-infographic-preview-sq.jpg?w=300" alt="cloud adoption in healthcare infographic" class="float-right" width="150" >
  </a>

  We compared survey results from [HIMSS' 2014 survey on cloud adoption](http://himss.org/2014-himss-analytics-cloud-survey-full-results?ItemNumber=41958) with their equivalent [2017 survey](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study). What we found is healthcare's definition of the cloud is changing.
:post: |+
  ## Shift to IaaS

  For the longest time Software as a Service, or SaaS, a.k.a. web-based productivity tools, has traditionally been associated with the term "cloud" ever since Salesforce's "No Software" campaign hit pay dirt in the early 2000s. Using the cloud meant using software.

  Within healthcare, we're not so sure that the definition of cloud is scoped only to SaaS anymore.

  The increase in interest in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between 2014 and 2017 is a good example. Hospital administrators view disaster recovery, data storage, data backup, and data archival critical and costly responsibilities. Turning to cloud-based services is helping manage costs and increased complexity. This was most evident in the simple summary of IaaS adoption:

  * In 2014, 15.3% of hospital CIOs surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services.
  * In 2017, 75% surveyed said they planned to use IaaS services within the next year.

  That's a remarkable jump.

  ## Data Data Everywhere

  The 75% number is due to market pressures, but likely a singular pressure more than the rest: Simply put, there is more health data being created than CIOs know what to do with it. Wearables are prevalent, digital health products are increasingly being adopted, and mobile health is maturing. Data is being generated from all angles and it's up to the CIO to ensure it's secure, interoperable, and cost effective.

  Even a few years ago there was a lot of data but it was manageable. It's not anymore, that's the clear signal: The acceleration of data creation is to the point where non-cloud-based IaaS services—like on-premise backup services—are simply too expensive and cumbersome.

  Because of the explosion of data, hospital organizations have many strategies to consider as they contemplate how to manage it all. What is clear from the survey data is cloud-based IaaS-like services are now in the plans of most CIOs.

  ## Hybrid Cloud is the preference

  What didn't make it into the infographic but is still very interesting to study is the type of cloud configuration. Since 2014, we've seen a massive shift to hybrid cloud structures.

  The concept of the cloud comes in three primary infrastructure types: Private, Public, and Hybrid. Private means largely single-tenant vertical stacks, which is believed to be the most secure per common convention. Public clouds are another way to say multi-tenant structures. Hybrids are somewhere in between.

  The biggest shift was in organizations moving towards hybrid models. It makes sense when you consider their concerns with security, cost, and complexity. Public structures work fine with SaaS type apps, but sometimes the preference for a private model is strong with data-based needs. That organizations are mixing and matching with hybrid models correlates with the push towards greater IaaS service adoption due to the explosion in data.

  ### How would you classify the type of cloud environment used by your organization?

  |Environment Type|2014 %|2017 %|
  |:-------------|-----:|-----:|
  |Private Cloud|37.1%|28%|
  |Hybrid Cloud|36.3%|58%|
  |Public Cloud|23.4%|10%|
  |Unsure|3.2%|5%|

  ## What this means to healthcare

  We believe all this data points to an increased acceptance of cloud-based solutions to emerging problems faced by hospital technology teams. In particular, it means the "bit has flipped" on security and privacy: In many ways, the cloud is now viewed as a safer alternative than outdated on-premise solutions.

  We expect a continual interest and acceptance in IaaS-like services, and even PaaS-like services, which by and large will shift the industry's overall definition of the "cloud" to more than just software.

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
