:summary: 'There is a lot of discontent with current EHRs, mainly due to limited features
  and overly complicated processes. But, what are the proposed solutions? '
:blog_lead: "As most healthcare technology professionals do, I was attempting to keep
  up to date on industry happenings in my down time and ran across [Beckerâ€™s](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/)
  article *[15 criticisms on the lack of EHR interoperability from an AHA report](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/15-criticisms-on-the-lack-of-ehr-interoperability.html)*
  by [Max Green](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/max-green/77/b9a/19). It is no secret
  that that there is a lot of discontent with current electronic health record (EHR)
  systems, mainly due to limited features and overly complicated processes that take
  away from patient care. But what this article failed to address are the proposed
  solutions to the perpetual problems. \n"
:post: "I think many of the problems physicians face with EHRs could be solved with
  an open API and an ecosystem of applications that can speed up the clinician workflow
  while maintaining the documentation quality required within the EHR. \n\nWith healthcare's
  new centralized focus on interoperability, the hope for a standardized exchange
  of PHI across healthcare systems is greater than ever. Recent federal endeavors,
  such as [Meaningful Use](https://datica.com/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
  have attempted to push vendors, organizations and providers towards a meaningful
  data sharing standard, but adding new tools onto a providers toolbelt is still quite
  the endeavor. As proposed in MU3, for EHRs to fully embrace interoperability open
  APIs must be enabled to support data access and collaboration. What does that mean?
  These buzzword terms get thrown around a lot without a lot of understanding or explanation,
  so let me clarify. \n\n### Open APIs Solve:\n\n- **Data Exchange**: By distinctly
  defining security mandates and transmissions, connectivity between healthcare systems
  can be rectified by open APIs. \n- **Scalability**: Open APIs allow for applications
  to share data with other healthcare systems creating the ability to rapidly and
  intensely scale. This means reducing custom APIs by EHR vendor and by hospital system.\n-
  **Foresight**: [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://datica.com/academy/introduction-to-fhir)
  is on the rise and an open API strategy enables the ability to support FHIR, [SMART](http://smarthealthit.org/),
  and other rapidly evolving platforms. \n\nAlthough open APIs can aid in a lot of
  the interoperability obstacles with current EHR systems, there are still problems
  that need to be addressed, such as patient engagement, workflows (notably around
  consents) and [integration](https://datica.com/managed-integration/) requirements.
  Notably, we need to figure out how to replace the existing health system and data
  requirements for real-time data and security through VPNs. With so much focus currently
  on the problems, even more vigor needs to be geared towards the solutions.\n\n\nIf
  you found this post useful, you might also like to read [Recommended FHIR API Implementation
  Principles](https://datica.com/academy/recommended-fhir-api-implementation-principles/).\n\n"
