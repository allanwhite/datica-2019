:summary: 'The buzz at HIMSS 2017: analytics, machine learning, AI, cyber-security,
  patient-centered care, and open data were a few themes we saw this year.'
:blog_lead: "[HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/) is done. It’s time for
  the outpouring of commentaries on the event. And, amazingly, it’s already time to
  be thinking about next year if you’re an exhibitor. I realize the big companies
  do this but, at Datica, we too are planning and already booked our booth for next
  year. Thankfully we got a good booth space on the top floor and not in the basement
  (Vegas needs 2 levels to support HIMSS whereas Orlando only needs one massive level)."
:post: "\n## Major Themes\n\nYou could have predicted these going into the event based
  on the sessions and promotional material.\n\n- **Analytics / machine learning /
  AI**. If I was to only pick one theme this year, this would be it. From Watson to
  Health Catalyst to the population health offerings of pretty much every EHR vendor,
  some form of analytics was woven into everything this year. Like patient engagement,
  a recurring HIMSS theme, [data analytics](https://datica.com/blog/3-benefits-of-accessible-big-data-analytics/)
  is seen as a major part of the future of care. Analytics does hold amazing potential
  but, like patient engagement, health systems need to develop strategies for how
  and where to use analytics if they are going to be successful. Analytics for analytics
  sake won’t help. Understanding the problems to solve or questions to answer with
  analytics is the key first step.\n- **Cybersecurity**. As more and more traditional
  health data goes digital, and more and more digital health data is generated by
  sensors and apps, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger topic. More health data flowing
  into more places means more financial risk of a [data breach](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
  Cybersecurity is an essential part of digital health, just like cloud is an essential
  part of digital health. This should be a recurring theme of HIMSS as the next 10
  years are going to be defined by healthcare moving data between new technologies
  and between new partnerships.\n- **Patient-centered care**. This is the one I wasn’t
  sure if I should include because I feel like some variation of this has been a recurring
  theme. I guess being a constant theme still makes it a theme. The idea of [patient
  centricity](https://datica.com/blog/the-cmio-role-in-the-era-of-value-based-care/),
  maybe because it has been a constant theme, is starting to mature. Services need
  to be centered on patients, and many of those services will be technology driven.
  The reason for services need to be patient-centered is 1) that’s what patients expect
  today and 2) that is what providers, payors, and life sciences need to do to compete
  for patients, members, and customers. I think we’ve swung back from the days when
  we thought B2C, or going direct to consumer, would work across most patient populations.
  Groups like Healthgrades still own a lot of consumer health traffic but integrating
  those consumer tools with providers and more formal care is also a part of patient
  centricity. \n- **Open data**. This one definitely isn’t new. I remember hearing
  [Todd Park beating the drum about *data liberación*](http://healthstandards.com/blog/2015/06/23/data-liberacion/)
  back in 2011. It only took three more years for most EHR vendors to start to get
  behind a new standard called FHIR and another three or so years, until today, when
  EHRs are ready to expose data via FHIR. I’m bullish on FHIR as a potential data
  standard but highly skeptical of FHIR as a path to open data and innovation. We
  have projects like Argonaut driving towards new ways to use FHIR so we’ll have to
  wait and see how those develop. The overwhelming sentiment around open data is that
  access to data, ideally in a trusted and consistent bi-directional way, is the only
  way to build the technology ecosystem that’s needed to put patients at the center
  of care and start to drive towards the [triple aim].\n\n## Same same, but different\n\nThere’s
  a saying I first heard in Thailand and use from time to time - [*same same but different*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish).
  I think it pretty accurately describes my impression of HIMSS 2017.\n\nStepping
  back, looking at HIMSS as a whole, it felt like we had simply transported all the
  infrastructure and logistics from Vegas in 2016 to Orlando in 2017. It didn’t really
  feel too [much different from HIMSS 2015](https://datica.com/blog/himss-2015-recap/),
  for that matter. [HIStalkapalooza](https://datica.com/blog/visit-the-datica-vip-area-at-histalkapalooza-2017/)
  happened. The Athena party happened. Lots of bankers parties with better food and
  drink options. Uber didn’t work well. Restaurants were full all the time. Epic,
  Cerner, Athena and a few others still had the largest booths. Yeah, it felt like
  HIMSS.\n\nBut then, in other ways, it felt very different from previous years. The
  impression I got, on a consistent basis, is that people are burned out on the status
  quo. People are tired of HIMSS being the same year after year. People are tired
  of \"doing things to check boxes\", a reference to buying EHRs to get money from
  Meaningful Use, and \"want to really start making things happen\". These quotes
  are from people at large health systems, people in the same roles that would have
  said something like \"Epic is going to do that\" when asked about patient engagement
  or population health or pretty much anything health IT just a few years ago. These
  are decision makers at the core of the health IT industry and not just startups
  and investors. The tide has very clearly turned in the industry.\n\nThis is exciting!
  It will take time to see how quickly this sea change practically takes hold and
  we start to see more and more digital health technologies adopted and scaled at
  health systems. But, the process is starting and big systems are developing strategies
  and processes for the next 3-5 years. And, maybe the most shocking part, especially
  compared to several years ago, is that health systems are looking outside their
  EHR vendors for the future of health IT.\n\n*Want to learn more about the trends

  :summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as
    connected health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
  :blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is
    very often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica.com/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
    or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
    they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track
    an individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health
    is much more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality
    in today’s world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative
    strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day
    lives of people.
  :post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed
    Joe Kvedar, MD](https://datica.com/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President,
    Connected Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet
    of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/) which is packed with
    real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors
    drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been a proponent
    of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest HIT influencers
    in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems to be solved.
    Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable
    sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected health journey\nSome
    aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re only likely a
    few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health journey.
    Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1. **The
    future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
    is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
    prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
    offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
    is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
    it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
    already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr.
    Kvedar explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate
    that data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis
    will become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
    the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
    that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
    digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
    it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says.
    “The next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create
    a unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected
    health journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example,
    motivating them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting
    to happen today despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr.
    Kvedar says the business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance,
    United Health Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device.
    If they achieve three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that
    wearable device, they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome
    parts of the healthcare industry seem to embrace the connected health journey
    faster than others. “Companies like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking
    in wearables’ data and giving consumers something back in return. They are all
    seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of
    the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs and hospitals are used to
    making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't quite figured out
    how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward hospitals for
    keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges are happily
    being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability \nEven
    though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for consumers,
    there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area of interoperability.
    \ Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n \n- **Proprietary
    technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s financial best
    interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you are an IT vendor,
    almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom all the way down
    to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in and upsell you
    new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering
    their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep
    you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On the
    hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven by
    the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
    a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
    to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
    interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
    award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible
    way hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could
    conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government
    purchasers that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have
    a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump
    administration, but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world
    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and
    chronic illness management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing
    health technology devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic
    illnesses but also helping to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n-
    **Wearables provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't
    result in symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol,
    visceral fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't
    really, on a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context,
    you can think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables
    provide feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a
    Fitbit, for example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be
    motivated to walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always
    motivate a lifestyle change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation.
    “It turns out there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t
    care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
    person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback
    loop is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains.
    That could be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe
    continues, “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in
    the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is
    the Spire device that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory
    rate; it tells you whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe
    differently under different conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables
    market as data becomes more meaningful to people with insights rather than just
    numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians
    today are inundated with data, most of it today within the EHR. Clinicians spend
    too much time clicking, finding, charting, and checking boxes to document the
    in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard to imagine connected health
    data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy process. Dr. Kvedar suggests
    this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n \n1. **The current state:**
    Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr. Kvedar sees connected health
    in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We have quite a few examples of
    that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and a lot of our primary care
    practices are patient centers or medical homes as part of our population health
    management structure. In those practices, there is someone whose responsibility
    is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide that person
    with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that are either
    difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is not enough
    of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
    is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to
    get their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags
    the patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort
    through. Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something
    that really needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**
    \ Most industries today are already using intelligent analysis software and data
    science that creates meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data.
    Dr. Kvedar describes how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at
    the beginning of a new era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've
    been tracking their blood pressure for the last two months. We should be able
    to give you a dashboard view that shows what blood pressures are normal when they
    go up, why they go up. Do they go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do
    they go up after a meal? That would give you some real insight into how to care
    for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions that seeing this all become a reality
    with physicians is dependent on solving more than just the problems of data overload
    and dashboards. Here are two other important dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If
    you call it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds
    scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort
    of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration. Will that change? Not sure.
    Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by two years from now will be
    value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans are now doing this but
    the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason we did medical home
    across our system is because of value-based payments and it makes much more sense
    in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of AI.** “On the one hand,
    we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call it decision support,
    maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you
    are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how you frame it. And,
    of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that and how you convince
    docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going to get sued because
    there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right in the algorithm.”
    \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The pieces of connected
    health are here today, but we still have to put them together. Some of that will
    be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is even societal.”\n\nMake

  :summary: This is the 1st of a 4-part series about high-level healthcare trends
    creating turmoil and uncertainty along with new opportunities in 2017 and beyond.
  :blog_lead: "There's often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year
    followed by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We've done
    this [before](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)

  :post: |
    Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll present four high-level trends that follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and new problems. Here's the 2017 healthcare trend #1.

    ## Walgreens, payors, life sciences, subscription medicine and the rise of the patient as consumer

    > "Businesses are no longer the sole creator of a brand; it is co-created by consumers through shared experiences and defined by the results of online searches and conversations." - Brian Solis

    One of the major shifts that has come to healthcare is the patient is at the center of the ecosystem. This has come about for a few reasons, namely due to societal and cultural shifts driving changing expectations but also because patients are feeling the burden of the costs of care more and more. [Shifts in technology](https://datica.com/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/) are underlying some of these shifts as well and certainly are enabling models of care where patients have more ownership.

    The reasons for the change are less important than the impact of the change on the industry and patients/consumers. Healthcare, a multi-trillion dollar industry, is experiencing a paradigm shift and the main user, the end user, is now the patient/consumer. This means the consumer is the new target and the [choke point][3] to massive aspects of the most massive industry in the world. Look no further than the myriad of initiatives from all the major sectors trying to "win" the consumer.

    * **Life sciences companies** are transforming themselves from makers of therapeutics to care management platforms that are complemented by therapeutics. This is an incredible change but one that is being taken because, like direct-to-consumer products, life sciences companies need to have a direct relationship with the end-user to effectively market and retain them as lifetime customers with very targeted marketing and promotion. Life sciences companies are well resourced and motivated to make this change, and will be spending more than any other segment to win the end user and deliver care management platforms.
    * **Retail pharmacies**, most specifically Walgreens and CVS, have been [expanding][4] their care delivery services, becoming more than simple drug dispensaries. Retail pharmacies now offer both chronic and acute care, preventative medicine (vaccines most specifically), and even telemedicine. Pharmacies are well placed, having 10s of 1000s of physical locations across the country, to be a larger and larger part of the way consumer access the healthcare system. Walgreens is even rolling out Epic as its EHR; despite being a strange choice for a retail clinic, Epic helps Walgreens integrate data to and from other Epic customers.
    * **Payors**, the largest ones in particular – United, Cambia, Blues, etc. – are expanding the tools they offer members to be more than simple data access and payment tools. Large insurance companies are building and testing apps for specific conditions and cohorts of members, wanting to flip the perception of payors in consumers' minds to more than payment tools managed by their employers. [Oscar][5] is a good example of a payor that doesn't act like a traditional payor.
    * **Subscription medicine** is here to stay, whether you call it [direct primary care (DPC)][6] or concierge. Concierge and DPC, interestingly, are the providers' response to this trend. Subscription medicine is about a direct relationship between providers and patients, without messy payors and administrative overhead between them. And subscription medicine is going to grow by leaps and bounds over the next 10 years. Consumers will seek to get back the personal side of medicine, something that is increasingly getting lost, and providers will seek the same direct, personal connections without the mess of working with payors. In terms of models of care, subscription medicine is the [best example of aligned incentives][7].

    There are a few things to note about the examples above. First, noticeably absent from the list are hospitals and health systems. It's not that health systems don't see these changes and growing threats, it's that [they are just too slow][8], and too poorly setup, to change. And, with the growth of consumer-based initiatives by all of the above, the erosion of the relationship between provider and patient is only accelerating the displacement of providers and the validity of the argument against MDs as PCPs and providers; it's a vicious cycle and providers are the major losers.

    The second thing to note is that this is a winner take all situation. Consumers, the group notorious for downloading then never using health apps, will not use multiple care management platforms from their drug company, insurance company, and local pharmacy. They prefer to use one platform for everything,  just as they now use the one app from their bank or an aggregator like Mint instead of using multiple apps from each specific financial institution they interact with. There's a lot of money for the winner. This is high stakes.

    So where does that leave health systems? From the list above, almost everything is focused on chronic care. Health systems, and MDs as providers, will continue to own high acuity care and the exceptional specialization that is now required for that care. The real risk is that whichever segment wins the consumer will control, either through human providers or AI-assisted clinical decision support, when patients are sent to providers and which providers they are sent to for high acuity care.

    This shift offers huge opportunities for care management technologies with the right partners. Some sectors and companies will build everything in-house while others will look to buy products and platforms. The companies that succeed will offer ready-to-implement systems with a mix of technology and services. In order for any of the above groups to succeed, the focus on consumers and end users has to be a super strategic initiative, not just about buying an app or platform but a complete suite of solutions and aligning the business at the highest level to accomplish the goals.

  :summary: HIMSS 2018 saw the presence of three of the largest cloud technology companies
    in the world, Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Google (Google Cloud) flex
    their muscles. In addition to a strong cloud showing, the event itself is evidence
    that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.
  :blog_lead: "For the last several quarters, we have brought you unique perspectives
    on disparate [topics affecting innovation in healthcare](https://datica.com/innovation/).
    In Datica’s Spring 2018 Innovation report, we highlight and reinforce what we
    know to be true and what many of you are experiencing: the digital health transformation
    is happening now and is grounded in innovation. Its sources might surprise you.
    \ \n\nIn addition to surveying news, stories, and industry reports, the quarterly
    report provides our takeaways on the recent HiMSS conference which we’ve extracted
    below. Make sure to get the [Spring Innovation Report](https://datica.com/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
    for a complete look at the state of Innovation in Healthcare. "
  :post: "<img alt=\"himss-2018-logo\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/BejYKjLiuWuE0iEK6WQIM/521488e52b97804bab49f7dd0a1994e2/himss-2018-logo.png?w=240\"
    width=\"120\" class=\"float-left-on-medium\" />\n\nHIMSS 2018 saw the presence
    of three of the largest tech companies in the world flex their muscles. The event
    itself is evidence that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.\n\n##
    The 3 largest tech companies flex their muscles at HIMSS\n\n### Microsoft showcased
    Azure at HIMSS\n\nDue to their rich health IT history, Microsoft has engaged with
    HIMSS in the past, but the company’s positioning in 2018 is noteworthy. A through
    line across its booth facilities, its engagements, and in 1:1 conversations was
    a focus on modernizing health IT via intelligent solutions. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) certainly had a presence, but it was grounded in usable tools like Office
    365 and Microsoft Teams. Any cloud reference had less to do with Azure itself
    and more to do with Microsoft solutions on the cloud. \n\n### AWS went big HIMSS\n\nFor
    the first time in its history, AWS went big with an impressive HIMSS booth. This
    major physical presence is the only major one in healthcare outside of their own
    re:Invent conference. AWS had a mix of solution architecture Q&A, presentations
    from its broad partner ecosystem, and demonstrations of healthcare-specific cloud
    solutions available on AWS. Its 2018 presence showed AWS cares about being active
    in health IT and [AWS has a strong story to tell](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-on-aws-is-possible-find-out-how-at-himss18/)
    with both new digital health companies and enterprise health IT. \n\n### Google
    went all out at HIMSS\n\nBut then we have Google. It also spent big — much bigger
    than Microsoft or AWS. Google had a major booth, but also several keynotes and
    high profile sessions that all must have cost enormous amounts in sponsorships.
    Of the three, it’s easy to see through total spend and coverage that Google is
    making the biggest bet that its cloud offerings can help healthcare. The only
    problem is understanding the actionable theme Google had in mind. Is it looking
    to help hospitals migrate old systems to Google’s cloud? Is it trying to get AI
    adopted in enterprises? The most consistent message centered on helping smaller
    startups succeed, which is then curious why Google would spend so much money getting
    in front of hospital CIOs. \n\nThe aggregate observation is big tech is looking
    to spend big dollars to land a big presence with this big event. All are here
    to stay this time. \n\n## Healthcare innovation was everywhere at HIMSS18\n\n###
    Certain innovations are now mature \n\nFrom the presence of the booths, the coverage
    within sessions, and the chatter amongst attendees, two major areas of innovation
    have finally made it: telehealth and population health. \nThose who follow healthcare
    know these two areas aren’t new, per se. But that’s not the point. The key observation
    from HIMSS18 is that, in the aggregate, all companies have “made it.” Their spend
    was enormous, their booths packed, their messages grand, and their sessions well
    attended. For upwards of a decade, we’ve talked about the eventuality of both
    telehealth and population health. Well, HIMSS18 proved to us that the companies
    that figured out the models have finally crested the mountain in that long journey,
    and are now part of the health IT regulars. \n\n### The startups are mostly focused
    on AI \n\nMost early-stage companies were predominantly downstairs in the startup
    hub, but some were upstairs as well. Regardless of the location, a clear and obvious
    trend prevailed: Artificial Intelligence. AI is coming to healthcare. When it
    arrives, we aren’t certain. Much like telehealth, its timing will likely be tied
    to payment structures and when healthcare systems are allowed to receive reimbursement
    for its use. But the sheer volume of AI-focused business, products, and tools
    staggered attendees and it felt inevitable that AI will disrupt healthcare in
    some capacity. Our guess is that many net-new products will be deployed over the
    next two years, will show demonstrative impact, and then after that a larger watershed,
    will happen similarly to what we saw with telehealth and population health. \n\n###
    Net-new innovation is more popular on the cloud than migrating old systems \n\nLastly,
    we saw the [healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) as
    a mixed bag at HIMSS18. Conversation after conversation indicated a resistance
    to migrating old systems to the cloud. Ultimately, CIOs aren’t interested in the
    downside — higher hidden costs than the cloud vendor space indicates, high probability
    of downtime or failure of fragile systems during migration, and general unease
    with understanding risks and liabilities yet on the cloud. \n\nDatica ran a CHIME
    focus group with 18 hospital and health system CIOs. Across the board, their sentiment
    remained the same. Migration of existing systems just isn’t a priority. \nOn the
    flip side, much innovation is happening with new projects. These innovations can
    either be in the form of digital health products CIOs are purchasing, or as internal
    projects led by innovation groups. The cloud is not universally bad in the eyes
    of hospital CIOs. In fact, all 18 voiced the priority of cloud-first innovations
    when evaluating new tools or solutions. \nThis dichotomy became one of the more
    interesting observations from HIMSS18. You might also want to take a look at the
    thorough recap and analysis of that [CHIME focus group here](https://datica.com/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).\n\n###
    More internal innovation is happening than many realize \n\nOne interesting thread
    throughout the entire conference hinged on the consistency of internal innovation
    being a focus. More conversations led to CIOs or innovation directors looking
    to internal resources for solving a specific problem at their system as opposed
    to buying a new product. \n\nIt’s not just centered with innovation groups, either.
    We were shocked to hear stories of how some institutions are completely rethinking
    innovation from the ground up, giving smaller teams more democracy in those innovations.
    The head of dermatology might be working on her own sanctioned project to innovate
    on a problem. The chief nursing officer might have the job of marshalling a skunkworks
    team to build a new tool for nurses. And so on. It’s happening across the country.
    \n\nIt’s great to see such innovation products constantly entering the health
    IT space. The level of sophistication in just the last few years has jumped considerably
    and will likely continue it’s rapid improvement through the coming years. \n\n\n"
