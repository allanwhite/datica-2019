:blog_lead: This second interview of our “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape” series,
  highlights the digital health innovation of Strata Health within the United States,
  and beyond. Operational in North America, the UK, France, and Australia, Strata
  Health is a privately held Canadian corporation of professionals with empathy for
  those who need care and intense respect for those who devote themselves to caring
  for others.
:post: "_[Peter Smith](https://stratahealth.com/about-us/executive-team/), Executive
  Vice President Canada for Strata Health, shares his insights into digital health
  innovation across the globe. Working with healthcare practitioners, clinicians,
  IT specialists and administrators, [Strata Health](https://stratahealth.com/) pioneered
  the development of powerful software tools that have revolutionized patient flow,
  benefiting patients, caregivers and system efficiencies alike. Their proprietary
  intelligent referral technology has positive effects right through the care system
  from better matching of patients to specialists all the way to reducing paperwork._
  \n\n## Q & A with Peter Smith\n\n### You operate in multiple countries with the
  U.S. being the most recent, whereas the typical digital health product is U.S.-centric.
  Do you see a big difference between the application or the success of digital health
  in the U.S. versus the rest of the world?\n\nBroadly speaking the application of
  digital health in the U.S. is more advanced than the rest of the world. This is
  due to the level of investment, the size of the population, and the amount of profit
  in the U.S. health market. There are also many other countries and innovation hotspots
  in the world but the U.S. generally attracts the most investment into digital health.
  But when you look at specific areas of digital health you can find examples where
  the U.S. lags behind the rest of the modern world. For example, using digital health
  tools and technology to improve the overall efficiency and cost of the health system
  is not that prevalent yet in the U.S. market. This is, at least in part, due to
  the fact that the U.S. market is for-profit private healthcare, which can create
  different incentives than you see in countries where the healthcare system is public.
  In countries with government paid (public) healthcare, those government bodies are
  driven to make the entire healthcare system as efficient as possible.\n\n### What's
  the biggest challenge holding back digital health innovation within the U.S. market?\n\nThere
  are many silos within the U.S. health market, and these silos most often operate
  as for-profit enterprises. This means each of these silos is looking to innovate
  when it makes economic sense for that silo, but not necessarily economic sense for
  the system, and not necessarily better care for the patient.\n\nThe U.S. is learning
  from the public health systems in the world. Examples are the creation of Accountable
  Care Organizations (which make providers jointly accountable for the health of their
  patients), and the concept of episode-based bundled payments (where providers are
  paid a fixed fee for a particular diagnosis or procedure, but no more if complications
  arise). The U.S. needs to review the interactions a patient makes with the various
  parts of the U.S. health system during a episodic journey, and then evaluate if
  the system is creating the right incentives for providers to perform in the best
  interest of the system and the patient, while still being a private enterprise.\n\n###
  Do you find the interest in digital health from C-suites to be the same in all the
  countries you operate in? Or different?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes there is equal
  interest in digital health from C-suites in Canada, U.S., U.K., Scotland, France,
  and Australia.\n\n### What’s Strata's greatest success story?\n\nThe health and
  social care teams across Cumbria are set to further roll out their Strata Health
  air traffic control system to manage patient transitions across the whole of the
  region. NHS Cumbria Partnership Foundation Trust, University Hospitals of Morecambe
  Bay NHS Foundation Trust, and Cumbria County Council have to date automated the
  process of health and social care referrals across the region, enabling transparent
  and consistent patient transitions supporting the patient journey while eradicating
  paper in the process. \n\n\n"

    the ongoing series called “Mapping the Digital Health Landscape,” highlighting
    the great work pursued by fellow digital health innovators.
  :post: "_Our first interview is with Seattle-based [C-SATS](https://www.csats.com),
    Inc., a venture-backed healthcare technology company on a mission to empower the
    nation’s 16 million healthcare workers and institutions to assess and improve
    their performance continuously, accurately and objectively._\n\n_Based on technology
    developed at the University of Washington by a team of surgeons, engineers and
    biostatisticians, C-SATS’ performance management system utilizes a unique combination
    of distributed experts and other reviewers available 24/7 from the Internet to
    assess healthcare professionals’ technical performance with accuracy equivalent
    to current gold standards…but at 80+% savings in cost and time to results._\n\n\n_We
    spoke with Derek Streat, C-SATS Co-founder and CEO._\n\n### When you think about
    digital health innovation for the healthcare industry and its institutions, what
    stage or part of the cycle are we in? \n\n<div class=\"person-card--vertical float-right-on-medium\">\n
    \   <img class=\"avatar circle\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2BF7cmdlRYYuOeguewIwUE/d88c8e111b8e4efedd7cee80666807a6/ZT4A0459-LinkedIn_72_dpi.jpg?f=face&fit=thumb&w=250&q=45\"

    \       <div class=\"person-name\">Derek Streat</div>\n        <div class=\"person-title\">Co-founder
    and CEO, C-SATS</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nWe’re still very early. Only within
    the last five years has the healthcare industry gotten around to thinking purposefully
    about patient experience. In most other industries, it’s standard operating procedure
    to surprise and delight your customers. We’re early with respect to technology
    enablement and platforms as well. The [electronic health records](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    and other systems that house the immense data generated about patients are still
    largely proprietary and closed. [Interoperability](https://datica.com/dhsf/#integration-understand-technology-landscape)
    is still a significant barrier to things like well-coordinated care, even within
    a single institution, because the systems are fundamentally built to stay closed
    and preserve legacy monopolies.  \n\n### Why doesn’t digital health innovation
    take hold faster in the healthcare industry?\n\nOne reason is the entrenched,
    closed-technology systems and infrastructure, making switching costs very high.
    A heightened sensitivity to privacy, security, compliance, and regulation erects
    barriers and costs as well. Health systems don’t just throw a new application
    in front of patients, and for good reason: the stakes are incredibly high. And
    if you're more risk averse, you’ll move slower. Finally, the economic models in
    healthcare are sufficiently broken that startups, often the source of scrappy
    innovation in other industries, have a harder time. That’s because those receiving
    value (patients) are disconnected from those who pay for it (think insurance).
    If it’s difficult to get paid for your product or service, and you’re a small
    startup, it’s tough to find the runway necessary to nurture true innovation.\n\n###
    Aside from the work of C-SATS, is there a digital health innovation you are most
    excited about?\n\nI’m most excited about the promise to bring [trust](http://www.csats.com/data-security/)
    to healthcare. I believe trust is the key because it leads to respect, understanding,
    and action among all stakeholders, from providers to health systems to patients.
    Trust will come through highly actionable insights derived from three areas: growing
    data sets, such as precision medicine; open systems to keep all parties informed
    of patient needs and care, for example, interoperable, cloud-based EMRs; and continuous
    monitoring and feedback loops to ensure excellent work, which is our business
    at C-SATS."

  :summary: Our Healthcare Innovators podcast continues with an illuminative interview
    with Aaron Neinstein, MD on tech that tames the deluge of patient generated data.
  :blog_lead: We continue our conversations on the subject of healthcare innovation
    with an illuminative podcast interview with Aaron Neinstein, MD. [UCSF’s Dr. Neinstein](https://aaronneinstein.com/)
    gives us a view into some of the promising technologies emerging to organize,
    digest, and analyze the massive amounts of patient-generated data we are quickly
    becoming inundated with. Neinstein also shares his ideas about what we can expect
    to see in the near future, as clinicians gain access to this data.
  :post: "\nHere are a just few of the many ideas you’ll hear in Datica’s Healthcare
    Innovators Series Podcast, [“Emerging Healthcare Data Challenges from Patient
    Centric Technologies.”](https://datica.com/innovation/aaron-neinstein-md-emerging-healthcare-data-challenges-from-patient-centric-technologies/)\n\n-
    **On openness to patient generated data:** “A big thing is more incentives from
    the payors, so over the last two years, we've seen the introduction of the Medicare
    chronic care management codes which create the payment opportunity for use of
    patient-generated health data. What those codes do is allow you to bill on on
    a monthly ongoing basis for taking care of a patient who has two or more chronic
    diseases. You could theoretically have a nurse or someone else on your staff managing
    the patient remotely and be billing for that time.”\n\n- **On other disease communities
    using diabetes as a model for technology and tech services:** “One place in particular
    where we are seeing similarities to diabetes is with asthma. If you think about
    capturing the action and activity that a patient takes in the normal course of
    the day. That's what we are talking about here; these are chronic diseases, where
    coming in for an office visit three or four times a year allows a narrow snapshot
    of what's happening in somebody's life. The reason we care about patient-generated
    health data is in theory because it gives us the opportunity to see what somebody
    is doing day-to-day, 24/7, 365 in the context of their life, and tweak their treatment
    regimen or change their behavior to improve the management of their chronic disease.”\n\n-
    **On how EHRs fit into the future of patient-generated data:** “I think one of
    the things that people don't think about is how many different categories of patient-generated
    health data there actually are. If you break it down, you are talking about 7
    or 8 categories of things that comprise what we now called PGHD.”\n\nSubscribe

  :summary: Our newest publication Rethinking Healthcare Technology includes expansive,
    useful, and original essays on digital transformation from insightful leaders.
  :blog_lead: That's the most important question clinicians are asking themselves
    in a post-EHR world where patients have supercomputers in their pockets, and they
    expect the same high-quality, on-demand experiences the Apples, Googles, Amazons,
    and Facebooks give them.
  :post: "\nA world where doctors are spending more time looking at a screen than
    engaging with the patient.\n\nA world where wearables are creating a glut of data,
    some useful but most of it useless, and none of it fits into the EHR seamlessly.\n\nBut
    especially a world where innovators and entrepreneurs have never been more equipped
    with ideas, access to funding, and technology doubling in power every few years.
    These innovators are poised to help transform healthcare, but something in the
    industry, something in the system is slowing them down or holding them back.\n\nDatica
