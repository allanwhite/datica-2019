:summary: We're pleased to announce the Datica CCMS — our latest and most flexible
  product that has an eye on the future.
:blog_lead: |
  Today I am excited to announce Datica's latest product, the [Cloud Compliance Management System](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/ccms), or CCMS.

  The CCMS is a symbol of the future of digital health on the cloud, and an evolution in vision from Datica.
:post: "Back in 2013 when we started this journey, several conditions existed which
  prompted us to build the first and only [compliant platform-as-a-service](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-platform-as-a-service/):\n\n_That
  was then..._\n\n* The HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule was signed, and a lot of confusion
  existed as to what compliance on the cloud actually looked like\n* AWS was the only
  major public cloud provider who signed a worthwhile BAA\n* Within their BAA, only
  4 services were actually \"HIPAA eligible\"\n* Microservices hadn't yet taken off\n*
  Docker was barely 1.0\n* Public availability of Kubernetes wasn't even a thing\n*
  Other PaaS products like Heroku didn't yet sign BAAs\n\nThe options for cloud infrastructure
  were limited for digital health apps, creating one of the many constraints on their
  success. Catalyze.io, [which we later rebranded to Datica in February 2017](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/catalyze),
  changed the game by providing a container-based deployment mechanism for cloud native
  environments that was 100% HIPAA compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified.\n\nFast forward
  five years. It's incredible how much the technology world has changed, and for the
  better.\n\n_...This is now_\n\n* AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all sign rock-solid
  BAAs\n* There are over 100 \"HIPAA eligible\" services across those clouds\n* Compliance
  is now more confidently understood on the cloud\n* Cloud native architectures are
  substantially more mature due to the global efforts of Docker, Kubernetes, et al\n*
  Microservices and managed services rule the day\n\nWhile a Compliant PaaS model
  has immense value for n-tier digital health applications looking to offload the
  entirety of DevOps and DevSecOps obligations, the fact is, in 2018, digital health
  applications simply demand more options with emerging cloud technology.\n\nDatica
  saw this in 2017, which is why we launched our [Compliant Kubernetes Service](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-kubernetes-service/)
  (CKS) in March 2018, the only HITRUST CSF Certified k8s cluster in the world. Customers
  told us how badly they wanted to use Kubernetes, but there were no good compliant
  options in 2017. CKS is a bridge product to help satisfy compliant k8s use cases
  for more complex digital health apps. Since then, all three major clouds now include
  their respective Kubernetes managed service in their respective BAAs, but attestation
  is proving hard for customers since so much of the configuration information required
  for assessments is unavailable via APIs or UIs. (Simple example: customers can't
  ascertain the OS or OS version running a k8s cluster.) Datica CKS has a role to
  play until the healthcare developers can successfully attest to assessments with
  other managed Kubernetes services.\n\nThe immediate problem with CKS, however, is
  that the Datica promise of compliance only extends to the k8s cluster itself. Most
  of the engineering world is interested in combining application orchestration platforms
  like Kubernetes with existing managed services, like managed databases AWS RDS,
  Azure Cosmos DB, or GCP Cloud SQL. Most people we talk to have a constellation of
  managed services comprising their cloud environment. Beginning at the start of 2018,
  we asked ourselves, _\"How can we empower digital health to adapt to the future
  of managed and microservices?\"_\n\nThat question drove the development of the [CCMS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/ccms).\n\nThe
  answer started with a fundamental shift in philosophy from Datica. The future of
  compliance is less a controlling one where we guarantee compliance by owning root
  on hosts, but rather a SaaS-based one that empowers endless number of architecture
  permutations based on the needs and desires of developers.\n\nThe challenge is the
  opaque responsibility hoisted on developers. \n\n* Most developers are unsure the
  exact configurations of certain managed services in order to map to specific framework
  controls.\n* Most developers are confused about the relationship between Privacy,
  Security, and Compliance—no, you are not compliant just by doing security things.\n*
  Most developers are unaware that compliance attestation is a 24/7 monitoring exercise,
  and not a set-it-and-forget-it job.\n* Most developers are mistaken that because
  their given cloud is compliant, the Shared Responsibility model means their business
  is now compliant. That is unequivocally false.\n\nThe CCMS solves those issues for
  developers. It is a SaaS tool which monitors the configuration states of supported
  managed services across the three major clouds. Each configuration is explicitly
  audited against the HITRUST CSF, ensuring that if adopted, the configured managed
  service should pass a HITRUST CSF assessment.\n\nAlong with the announcement of
  the CCMS, we also launched free configuration guides for the three most basic managed
  database services across AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\n* [AWS RDS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n*
  [Azure Cosmos DB configuration guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/azure-cosmos-db-guide-how-to-configure-cosmos-db-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n*
  [Google Cloud SQL configuration guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/google-cloud-sql-guide-how-to-configure-gcp-cloud-sql-to-comply-with-hipaa/)\n\nEach
  guide gives a step-by-step walkthrough on how to configure the respective service
  to the HITRUST CSF. We will be launching more guides throughout the fall. Each guide
  will be an example of how the CCMS will function.\n\n## Empowering developers is
  the future of digital health\n\nWe believe so strongly in the present and future
  situation that we wrote a book about it, launching last month. _Complete Cloud Compliance_
  is a 100-page explanation of the conditions of compliant, the cloud, and data interoperability
  that lead healthcare technology to where it is today, but more importantly where
  it is moving in the future.\n\nThe book will be generally available for purchase
  (at cost) later this year. To sign up to be notified of availability, head over
  to [completecloudcompliance.com](https://completecloudcompliance.com).\n\n## The
  CCMS is generally available in early 2019\n\nWe are diligently building the CCMS
  and working toward a generally available release. Existing Datica customers will
  get a limited availablility preview this fall, with new customers being able to
  sign up in early 2019.\n\nSo why are we announcing this today?\n\nIn short: Because
  there is no use in waiting to discuss the future. \n\nIt's to everyone's advantage
  to start talking about what empowering digital health developers looks like on the
  modern cloud. It's to our advantage to get feedback from people like you on which
  cloud services matter to you. ([Fill out a survey here to let us know!](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/cloud-compliance-management-system/survey/))
  And it's to your advantage to know that as a digital health developer, you **can**
  participate in modern development choices while having the confidence that you can
  pass a HITRUST assessment.\n\nLet us know what you think! Keep an eye out for continued
  discussion throughout the rest of 2018.\n"

    ## Why we wrote a book

    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?fm=jpg&w=150&q=20" class="float-right lozad" data-src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?w=300" width="150" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance Book" />

    In 2013, when Datica was founded as [Catalyze](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/catalyze), the cloud was a simpler place. AWS was the only public cloud that signed a meaningful [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), but they only had a handful of services (or "primitives") within scope. Even so, to sign the BAA, which was under NDA, required customers use dedicated instances which meant digital health companies had to spend a minimum $1,400 per month just to get started — and that doesn’t even account for the cost to solve [the remaining 9/10ths of compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-kubernetes-service/aws/). Docker wasn't yet version 1.0, and [Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) wasn't even a thing yet. The term "microservices" meant nothing. Modern container-based cloud architectures that were fully HIPAA compliant and could be HITRUST CSF Certified were impossible on the public cloud until [Catalyze's first platform-as-a-service product](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/catalyze-closes-series-a-funding-to-expand-development-of-its-healthcare-platform/) came along.

    Fast forward to 2018, and the cloud is a very different place. __We are now living in a post-cloud world.__ That post-cloud world is built on managed services. AWS is now up to hundreds of these services and dozens within scope of their BAA. Azure and GCP sign rock-solid BAAs consisting of just as many world-class services and all three are competing to be a viable destination for digital health workloads. Many independent managed services, like MongoDB's Atlas, sign BAAs now, too. The typical cloud architecture is a constellation of managed services using a microservices-based scheme. Just the other day, I was speaking to a digital health developer who mentioned his company uses the basics like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway, but is using BigQuery on GCP for machine learning and investigating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Cosmos as an eventual Kubernetes destination, while also incorporating MongoDB Atlas, Auth0, and a handful of independent logging and monitoring services. Whew. This is not manic decision making. This is the new normal.

    > Compliance has not kept up. We know this first hand.

    The issues are foundational, from our experience. Compliance officers are often attorneys and not technologists so they have a hard time grasping how fast abstraction on the cloud is moving. Likewise, engineers are not legal scholars, so they have a tough time wrapping their heads around a proper compliance program that is the difference between their app being adopted by hospitals or dying on the vine. I still personally have about one conversation a day with a developer where I have to coach them that [HIPAA is a government regulation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) while [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) is a certification framework.

    In 2013, the cloud was built for an operator archetype, the type of employee who could secure Virtual Machines (VMs) and contribute to a compliance program. After five years, the cloud is now designed for developers who can easily interchange services with a few clicks. What we are seeing is this new archetype is not ready for security and compliance in a managed services world. All we have to do is look around to find news stories of the situation. [Just last month, an improperly configured AWS S3 bucket lead to 31,000 GoDaddy servers to be exposed](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/09/amazon-aws-error-exposes-31-000-godaddy-servers/).

    These foundational challenges are why we wrote _Complete Cloud Compliance_. Our goal is always to help the healthcare community, but educating people on such heady topics extended beyond a blog post or online knowledge base. A book proved to be the right medium. Travis Good (Datica CEO) and I started the writing process earlier this year with the first edition printed last month.

    ## Structure of the book

    The book starts out with a basic introduction then flows into the following chapter setup:

    1. __The Business Case for Compliance__ — an examination on why compliance actually matters to regulated companies like digital health.
    2. __[What _Really_ is Compliance?](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/)__ — We tried very hard to be simple and concise while also educating complex topics to those who are fresh to the respective domains. Consequently, this chapter breaks down critical compliance concepts with a developer reader in mind, meaning compliance officers will find the content familiar. Feedback from developers has been fantastic, however.
    3. __What _Really_ is the Cloud?__ — The cloud is not a computer in somebody else's data center. It's software-enabled infrastructure services built for software developers. This chapter was written for this post-cloud world, but it does lay some basic foundational concepts to help educate business folks. Feedback from engineers to compliance officers to business users has been very positive.
    4. __Why Data Interoperability Matters__ — Readers will find a consistent theme throughout the book: data is splintering, not consolidating, which makes compliance even harder. This chapter uses healthcare to explain how interoperability matters to compliance.
    5. __Complete Cloud Compliance__ — After the context is set, we give a detailed overview on how regulated companies can employ a compliance program that genuinely gives them dynamic, continuous compliance on an ever-changing cloud. We call the program Complete Cloud Compliance, as the book title implies, and 3C for short throughout.
    6. __Best Practices for Complete Cloud Compliance__ — With the 3C program in mind, we then provide a few dozen best practice pieces of advice for managing compliance on the cloud.
    7. __The Achievable Mandate__ — Readers within regulated companies should not fear the future, but embrace it because it's critical for survival. The good news is controlling compliance on the cloud is possible.

    ## Visually explaining compliance

    The book is purposefully very visual. The reasoning is pretty simple. Ultimately, this is a very boring and very complex topic. We don't pretend that this is the most exciting domain just because we live in it everyday. No, compliance is mind-numbingly boring.

    But it is critical to the future success of regulated companies, and by extension digital health. We fundamentally believe that unless healthcare can get on the cloud, it is at grave risk of falling even further behind, to which compliance is a blocker.

    To combat the boring nature of our lovable domain, we went heavy on visual storytelling. Readers will find sprinkled throughout the book several infographics geared as simplifying extremely complex topics. We think it worked well.

    Take this image for example. In chapter two (which is downloadable at the end of this post), we break down the differences between regulations, standards developing organizations, standards themselves, and frameworks. When we get to the frameworks section, we wanted to make clear that it is wise to work with frameworks that are built for the future, to which HITRUST is a good choice. When demonstrating the point, we charted the lineage of influences dating back almost a century that went into HITRUST's CSF. We thought it told an interesting story.

    ## The 9 Big Ideas

    Woven throughout the book are nine big ideas, many of which are brand-new ways of thinking by Datica that we are thrilled to start to share with the community. They are:

    1.  [When controlled, compliance is actually a competitive edge.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-a-competitive-edge-cee13073cf54 "Read more on this topic")
    2.  [The cloud is no longer other people's computers. It is managed services.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/the-cloud-is-software-for-developers-not-hardware-for-operations-9503c0e3e86 "Read more on this topic")
    3.  [As cloud services get more abstract to improve developer experience (a good thing), more control is being taken away from the user making compliance attestation harder (a bad thing).](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/shared-responsibility-on-the-cloud-a-solution-for-managed-services-or-opacity-for-cloud-customers-fc01fbe18897 "Read more on this topic")
    4.  [Compliance is only as strong as the weakest link in the abstraction chain.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/abstraction-on-the-cloud-increases-the-risk-of-weak-links-4641e20c0bbc "Read more on this topic")
    5.  Frameworks are the best way to manage regulations. The best frameworks are built for a dynamic future, not a dated past.
    6.  Complete cloud compliance is hard because technologists struggle to understand compliance while compliance officers struggle to understand the cloud.
    7.  [The cloud is global, so compliance is now global.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-now-global-because-the-cloud-is-global-d938de1626ea "Read more on this topic")
    8.  [Cloud compliance comes down to data management. The three verbs of data are store, compute, and transmit.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/from-ehrs-to-data-driven-healthcare-c33e0e27ee95 "Read more on this topic")
    9.  Data sources are splintering instead of unifying, making compliance more complex.

    You will see us publish more about these big ideas throughout 2018.

    to organizations like Cloud Foundry offering [Kubernetes services](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/),
    the world is shifting toward containers.
  :post: "\nIf you're working inside of a regulated industry, like healthcare or finance,
    these tools may seem out of reach. The compliance requirements and security restrictions
    of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP, NIST, PCI, and more can seem like impossible hurdles
    to jump when it comes to adopting a platform like Kubernetes.\nThis is exactly
    why [Datica is shifting toward Kubernetes](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    Our customers are asking for it, it’s the future of managing workloads born in
    the cloud, and Datica is already the most robust solution for compliance management
    on the planet. \n\nIf you're new to container orchestration and more familiar
    with a fully managed platform, like Heroku or Datica's legacy product, Kubernetes
    can seem complex. The goal of this article is to compare Kubernetes with a traditional
    PaaS, discuss the differences, and examine the tradeoffs.\n\n> Now that the world
    has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools have become ever
    larger and more complex.\n\n## What is a PaaS?\n\nA Platform as a Service, or
    a PaaS is intended to create a layer of abstraction on top of cloud service providers
    (or in some cases data centers and bare metal) so the end user can focus on deploying,
    managing, and scaling their applications and data. Without going into the [history
    of the PaaS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/) concept,
    it's easy to think about it as a way of automating many of the repetitive, lower-level
    tasks of managing workloads on a server.\n\n## How a PaaS works\n\nThe most well
    known PaaS providers are [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
    and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). These systems work when
    developers make minimal configuration changes to their application's code and
    then simply \"push\" their code to the cloud. The PaaS will then make an attempt
    to understand the code, install the required dependencies, containerize the application,
    and then serve it up. These providers then have a UI layer for managing resources,
    networking, access, and more.\n\n## The benefits of a PaaS\n\nBeing able to directly
    push your code to the cloud and have it running is a tremendous benefit over the
    old days of standing up a server, installing an operating system (and then patching
    it each time there's a vulnerability), getting nginx configured properly, and
    much more. With a PaaS, developers can focus on delivering value via their product,
    not building IT infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being able to simply push your
    code and have it running, many of these PaaS providers also couple database managed
    services as part of their Platform.\n\n## The pitfalls of a PaaS\n\nThe ease of
    use for a PaaS comes at the cost of flexibility. Want to install custom software
    on an instance? Nope. Want to ssh into an instance to investigate an issue that
    isn't appearing in the logs? Nope. Want to do anything beyond a simple Ruby, Python,
    or Node app? Good luck.\n\nA PaaS serves a very specific purpose — to help small
    teams with simple applications run those in the cloud without the DevOps overhead
    of managing a fleet of instances on AWS or Azure.\n\nThe primary reason why so
    many PaaS providers have failed to make substantial headway in the enterprise
    space is because the model is so restrictive. For an organization managing hundreds
    of applications with petabytes of data, it makes more sense to build out a team
    that can manage all of it instead of making substantial changes to your business
    in order to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\n## Enter Kubernetes and containers\n\nNow
    that the world has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools
    have become ever larger and more complex. A small organization that just three
    years ago could have survived on Heroku is now growing at a pace that prohibits
    them from continuing to use a restrictive PaaS. Maybe they're exploring machine
    learning or want a data warehouse. Whatever the case, they've outgrown the PaaS
    model. Now they need to move to something more flexible: Kubernetes.\n\nSince
    the invention of containers, and specifically with the popularity of Docker, organizations
    have been figuring out easier ways to orchestrate containers — that is, how to
    get them running, connected and served up in the cloud. In a way, orchestration
    is the primary function of a PaaS. Because containers are relatively trivial to
    build (and in most cases the build process can be automated, ex: [Gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/))
    the focus in the container space has been on orchestration.\n\n## The benefits
    of containers\n\nThe benefits of containers over virtual machines has been discussed
    to no end on the internet. I won't go into detail here, but simply put — with
    containers, developers can port their applications from machine to machine whether
    that's running it locally on a Mac, on a server in AWS or on a droplet on Digital
    Ocean. A container is a container and it can run anywhere. Compare this to the
    complexity of managing an entire fleet  VM, each with its own OS. With containers
    there’s only one operating system to manage, even with hundreds of containers.\n\n##
    Why Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes and containers have many of the same benefits. They
    can both run anywhere and they both function the same whether they're running
    on AWS, Azure, GCP, or in the locked closet down the hall. Kubernetes is open
    source, financially backed by hundreds of organizations, and is managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). In addition to being
    cross-cloud compatible and open source, Kubernetes has also shown tremendous growth
    in the last year.\n\nIf you’re coming from a PaaS you’ll no doubt have concerns
    around the ease of use and lack of automated DevOps support in Kubernetes. When
    I first explored Kubernetes in late 2014 I walked away feeling like it was too
    complicated and didn’t fit Datica’s customer use case. In 2018 it’s a different
    story.\n\nSince Kubernetes officially hit 1.0 in 2015, the community and project
    have grown at a tremendous pace. What really makes Kubernetes a viable option
    is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround
    it. Kubernetes isn’t a PaaS, it’s a foundation on which to build a PaaS.\n\nThink
    of Kubernetes and the cloud native community as a set of building blocks. With
    these building blocks you can construct any number of different solutions. No
    longer are you held back or restricted by PaaS providers. \n\n## Which to choose\n\nThe
    decision to choose Kubernetes over a PaaS (or vice versa) is going to depend on
    your business, technology, market, team, and several other factors. Having said
    that, even if you currently have a simple application with a relatively smaller
    user base, you’re likely going to scale and change rapidly. Preparing for the
    future by moving to containers now is going to save you time and money when it
    becomes critical later on.\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
