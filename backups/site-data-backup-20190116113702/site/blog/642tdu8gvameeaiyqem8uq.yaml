:summary: In 2017, digital health funding broke records and, if the first quarter
  of this year is any indication, 2018 is set to continue the trend. A trio of recent
  reports highlights the attention and funds digital health companies are garnering
  this year.
:blog_lead: 'The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [defines digital health](https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/digitalhealth/)
  as products and services in mobile health, health information technology, wearable
  devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine. With such a broad
  definition consisting of so many categories it’s no surprise that there are still
  lots of questions about what constitutes a digital health product. In fact, when
  we took a look at three different reports of funding for digital health companies,
  we got 3 different figures! One thing that is not in doubt though, is that digital
  health is attracting billions of dollars in funding. '
:post: "\nIn 2017, digital health funding broke records and, if the first quarter
  of this year is any indication, 2018 is set to continue the trend. It’s clear that
  digital health has moved from being a buzzword to being the focus of investment
  activity. A trio of recent reports highlights the attention and funds digital health
  companies are garnering this year. \n\n## Mercom reports $2.5B in digital health
  funding \n\nMercom Capital provides research, consulting, and communications in
  the healthcare industry, and their [first quarter of 2018 report](https://hitconsultant.net/2018/04/17/q1-2018-digital-health-vc-funding/)
  reveals there were $2.5 billion in digital health deals. About $936 million of that
  total came from just five deals, meaning that more than one-third were the result
  of what analysts are calling megadeals. \n\n* The five companies included: \n* Heartflow,
  which raised $240 million\n* Helix, at $200 million\n* SomaLogic, $200 million\n*
  PointClickCare, $146 million\n* Collective Health $110 million\n\n## Rock Health
  reports $1.62B in digital health funding\n\nRock Health provides fundraising, planning,
  customer and business development, and communications services, among others, to
  their clients. They issued a report regarding [Q1 funding in digital health](https://rockhealth.com/reports/q1-2018-funding-keeps-climbing-as-digital-health-startups-double-down-on-validation/)
  as well. Given the fuzzy nature of the definition of digital health, it’s no surprise
  that different companies measure different things and come up with different numbers.
  Rock Health reports $1.62 billion in digital health deals for 2018. \n\nThe same
  five megadeals are listed in Rock Health’s report, along with a list of the top
  six funded value propositions, and the companies that got the most funding in each
  category: \n\n* Diagnosis of the disease, Heartflow\n* Monitoring of the disease,
  Bigfoot\n* Consumer health information, Helix\n* Research and development, DNAnexus\n*
  On-demand healthcare services, American Well\n* Health benefits administration,
  Collective Health\n\n## Startup Health reports $2.8B in digital health funding\n\nA
  third [report, from Startup Health](https://www.slideshare.net/StartUpHealth/startup-health-insights-digital-health-funding-report-q1-2018-92817803)
  has the total deal volume for Q1 2018 at $2.8 billion across 191 deals. They list
  five takeaways based on their data:\n\n* Funding is not slowing down\n* The digital
  health market is maturing and growing\n* Solutions for providers attract the most
  money\n* Israel and China are driving international growth\n* There is a robust
  investor ecosystem surrounding digital health\n\n\nThe Rock Health report also examines
  what kinds of technologies were receiving the most funding. In spite of all the
  recent chatter about AI, web applications and genetic sequencing technologies topped
  the list. Providers and patients were the top two end users, and most of the digital
  health companies that were funded in the first quarter were agnostic as far as specialty
  area. \n\n## What the experts think \n\nLisa Suennen, the senior managing director
  at GE Ventures, overseeing the company’s healthcare venture fund, says in a [MedCity
  News article](https://medcitynews.com/2018/05/as-digital-health-companies-proliferate-its-getting-tougher-to-spot-the-strongest-businesses)
  that one implication of the volume of digital health deals in the first quarter
  of the year implies there are simply too many companies. “Perhaps it’s just me,”
  she writes, “but it’s getting harder and harder to tell the difference between the
  myriad of entrants in a variety of categories.”\n\nAn [article published on Healthcare
  Dive](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/blockbuster-digital-health-funding-to-spill-to-2018/513301/)
  in January, well before most of the deals detailed in first quarter reports were
  made, points out that “The US stock market overall is getting smaller and companies
  are delisting faster than new companies are filing IPOs...Digital health exists
  within that larger industry trend and faces the same problems.” \n\n\nIf 2018 continues
  the way it has started, this year will be an amazing year for digital health startups.

    Members of the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)
    answered questions regarding their organizations’ plans and efforts to move their
    data to the cloud. The results reveal that many healthcare organizations are in
    a holding pattern. '
  :post: "Cloud storage has the potential to change healthcare in positive ways, from
    administration efficiencies to population health. An array of new opportunities
    for providers await when moving data storage into the cloud. But, there’s a long
    way to go before that potential can be realized.\n\n## Cloud adoption is a top
    priority, but not in full throttle mode\n\nAbout 80% of the survey respondents
    said that cloud hosting is in the top 20 priorities within their organizations;
    however, only around 30% said they have a strategy for that data migration. Such
    massive operational changes take time. We need only look at healthcare’s recent
    past with implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) to see the truth
    in that statement. \n\n*JUST RELEASED: Get Datica’s [2018 CIO Cloud Perspectives
    Survey here](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/healthcare-cloud-take-off-waiting-for-fog-clear/)*\n\nThose
    organizations that have already made the cloud leap are innovating: 32% are using
    the cloud to build machine learning applications, and 45% are creating applications
    to improve population health. With the possibility of such uses, why are some
    organizations hesitating? \n\nOne of the biggest concerns survey respondents cite
    is around security. Roughly 50% said it is a primary worry. Given the regulatory
    landscape and the sensitivity of protected health information (PHI), it’s not
    surprising that security is a top concern. As cloud hosting becomes a more viable
    option, new tools are emerging to give healthcare organizations greater control
    over their data, which will help dissipate concerns about data security. \n\nAnother
    barrier for some organizations is the lack of a clear business value in storing
    data in the cloud. About 40% of the executives who took the survey said that things
    like what to do with existing equipment or how their organization would make practical
    use of cloud storage impedes the shift.\n\n## Some are taking to the cloud, others
    remain grounded\n\nAlmost 20% of survey respondents reported that their organizations
    are already hosting 50% or more of their software infrastructure remotely. An
    additional 14% said at least a quarter to half of their infrastructure is hosted
    remotely. That means just over one-third of the organizations represented in the
    Datica survey are discovering what works, what possibilities are opened, and how
    the cloud might improve healthcare delivery. \n\nConversely, about 20% of the
    executives said that migrating data storage to the cloud was not a current priority
    for their organization. [Regulatory compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/),
    security, and privacy are all concerns, among others. \n\nIn the broadest terms,
    the survey seems to show that executives are aware of the potential of the cloud,
    both for improving healthcare delivery as well as for data breaches. As is always
    the case, some organizations are innovating and pushing the limits of what is
    possible, while others take a wait-and-see attitude. \n\n\n"

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

    \n\nDatica’s 2018 spring innovation report examines how the media is describing
    the digital health transformation through four articles from major industry publications.
    The report also examines insights from Accenture and the World Economic Forum
    surveys, and takes a look at HIMSS 2018. "
  :post: "## Surprising digital health trends reported by the media\n\nFeaturing stories
    from The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Harvard Business Review, and Healthtech
    News, Datica’s Spring 2018 innovation report finds that there are some specific,
    and perhaps surprising trends in digital innovation. From hospitals supporting
    startups to the competition for data that artificial intelligence is bringing
    about, the four articles touch on current hot button topics. \n\nIn a story titled
    [“Hospitals Fund Potential Game-Changers in Health Tech”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-vie-to-fund-a-health-tech-breakthrough-1520430189)
    the Wall Street Journal reports on how some hospitals are beginning to fund health-tech
    startups in the hopes of supporting innovation that will result in improvements.
    Hospitals are in a good position to decide which innovative projects to support
    because hospitals have the clearest understanding of their own problems that need
    to be solved. \n\nThe Economist tackles the topic of medical data and technologies
    surrounding it in an article titled [“Data and medicine: A revolution in healthcare
    is coming.”](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming)
    Applications that detect heart arrhythmia or that have diagnostics capabilities
    are powerful, as are those that may improve the management of chronic disease.
    However, the article misses the mark in its implication that those types of technologies
    are on the verge of widespread adoption. Such innovations will change healthcare,
    but it will happen gradually. \n\nPatient-centered is a phrase that appears in
    almost every discussion of digital health innovation, and the Harvard Business
    Review examines the importance of keeping the patient front and center in an article
    titled [“Putting Humans at the Center of Health Care Innovation.”](https://hbr.org/2018/03/putting-humans-at-the-center-of-health-care-innovation)
    Innovation is most important when it puts people, rather than money, at the center.
    \n\nAdvancing innovation in digital health is going to require a migration to
    the cloud, according to an article in Healthtech News titled [“Eric Schmidt lays
    out formula for healthcare innovation.”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/eric-schmidt-lays-out-formula-healthcare-innovation)
    Moving to the cloud will mean having an infrastructure that is tested, interoperable,
    and secure. However, AI is going to require data acquisition because it depends
    on large datasets to determine algorithmic success. \n\n## Reports from the Experts\n\nReports
    from institutions, academic organizations, and consulting firms often contain
    insights that aren’t always obvious from interactions with partners and customers.
    The Datica spring innovation report includes summaries from two such reports:
    the [Accenture Digital Health Technology Vision 2017](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-digital-health-tech-vision-2017)
    and the [World Economic Forum report.](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/healthcare-building-a-digital-healthcare-system/)
    \n\nEach of the reports points to trends that are going to impact the digital
    health transformation. AI, digital ecosystems, open marketplaces for talent, the
    need for better understanding human behavior, and entirely new digital industries
    are all mentioned in the Accenture report. The World Economic Forum included discussion
    of how to build a digital healthcare system that will empower people. \n\n## Heavyweights
    at HIMSS18\n\nMicrosoft has always been involved in [HIMSS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/himss18-recap-invasion-major-tech-providers/),
    but this year their focus was less on Azure and more on the Microsoft solutions
    on the cloud. AWS had a bigger presence than ever before at HIMSS, and featured
    demonstrations of solutions to specific healthcare problems. \n\nGoogle put on
    a show bigger than either Microsoft or AWS, with a major booth and high profile
    sessions and keynotes. However, it wasn’t clear exactly what cloud-based solutions
    Google is offering the healthcare sector. \n\nTelehealth and population health
    have matured. They are no longer coming soon but have arrived. Both technologies
    are now part of the health IT landscape. \n\nIT was also clear at HIMSS18 that
    there’s more innovation happening than necessarily meets the eye. New projects
    in digital health products as well as internal innovation within organizations
    are likely to spur rapid improvements in the near future. \n\nThe full [Datica
    Spring 2018 innovation report](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
    elucidates the sources currently driving the digital health transformation. By
    pulling together unique perspectives on disparate topics, Datica clearly describes
    the innovation situation and how it’s impacting digital health. \t\t\t\t\t\n"

  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

  :summary: Digital health apps have been accompanied by plenty of hype, but a new
    report shows that the hype may be justified with $7 billion/year potential.
  :blog_lead: Digital health apps have been around for a few years, and have been
    accompanied by plenty of hype, but a new report shows that the hype may be justified
    — not because of innovation, but because such apps have the potential to save
    the US healthcare system as much as $7 billion annually.
  :post: "A recent [report from the data science firm IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/institute/reports/the-growing-value-of-digital-health)
    examines the impact of digital health apps on the healthcare industry. In the
    last two years — the time since the last report on the topic from IQVIA — there
    has been both an increase in the number of apps available, as well as in the amount
    of evidence supporting the benefits of their use. \n\nThe report includes some
    noteworthy statistics:\n\n* There are 318,000 health apps and 340 wearable devices
    available worldwide\n* Since 2015, 153,000 new apps have appeared in the Apple
    Store and Google Play\n* 200 new health apps are added each day\n* 40% of those
    new apps are related to health condition management/patient care\n* 55% use sensor
    data\n* 95% of all health apps have fewer than 5000 installs\n* 41 apps have more
    than 10 million downloads each, and account for nearly half of all health app
    downloads\n* 25% of physicians actively recommend digital health apps\n* 13% of
    physicians use remote patient monitoring technologies\n* 20% of large health systems
    are moving from digital health app pilot programs to full-scale rollouts\n\nEach
    one of those facts could be the topic of a blog post, but the report also addresses
    another interesting point: the fact that digital health apps can both provide
    improved patient outcomes and save the health system money. According to the report:
    \n\n> The use of Digital Health apps in just five patient populations where they
    have proven reductions in acute care utilization (diabetes prevention, diabetes,
    asthma, cardiac rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation) would save the U.S.
    healthcare system $7 billion per year and provide tangible outcomes improvements.\"
    \n\nIt is noteworthy that, in the statement above, the report is only discussing
    five specific patient populations — those that have been been investigated in
    random clinical trials (RCTs) extensively and been proven to reduce the use of
    acute care facilities. RCTs are considered the gold-standard in clinical investigations.
    \n\nOne of the most significant points included in the report is the fact that
    the number of studies investigating digital health apps, especially RCTs, has
    been accelerating. There were 571 such studies between 2007 and 2017, with 25%
    of them being published in 2017. \n\nThe evidence provided by scientific investigations
    is crucial because it demonstrates the [value of digital health apps](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/esther-dyson-q-and-a-on-digital-health-and-getting-to-the-end-game/).
    According to the report:\n\n> Value in healthcare can be defined as the health
    outcomes created for patients relative to the cost of generating those health
    outcomes, as well as the extent to which the ‘triple aim’ of improving the patient
    experience, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita costs
    of healthcare is delivered.”  \n\nThe digital health apps that are available for
    diabetes prevention, diabetes, [asthma](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/propeller/),
    cardiac rehabilitation, and pulmonary rehabilitation have been tested and shown
    to reduce the number of times patients must seek acute care. If they were adopted
    widely, the savings — $7 billion annually — would be significant. \n\nAlthough
    decisions within specific healthcare systems are generally made one app, or one
    category, at a time, policymakers consider the value of digital health apps in
    a more general way, such as the value to the overall health system. And, in the
    case of Congress, “value” often means cost-savings. \n\nThe report notes that
    policy initiatives related to technology adoption within the healthcare system
    are relatively rare, and when they do occur, the driver is usually evidence of
    significant cost savings. \n\n> Given the acceleration in clinical evidence development
    in recent years, persuasive cost savings arguments surrounding Digital Health
    apps may be within reach.” "
