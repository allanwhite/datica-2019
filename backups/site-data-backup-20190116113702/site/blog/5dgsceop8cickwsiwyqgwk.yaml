  9-time HIMSS attendee shares his advice to surviving and staying sane at HIMSS18. '
:blog_lead: |
  HIMSS is my most exhausting week of the year. I think this is my 9th HIMSS. Today, with 40,000+ attendees, it’s a logistical nightmare from start to finish. Everything from transportation to coffee is a challenge. Events go late into the night, and I always seem to have an early coffee or breakfast meeting, so sleep isn’t plentiful. I’m not sure if I prefer Las Vegas to Orlando as the location for HIMSS. Both have pros and cons.

  Below is my personal HIMSS survival guide. Hopefully, I can remember these things and keep my sanity next week.
:post: "\n## Be patient\n\nWhen you cram 40,000+ people into any location, even a
  behemoth Las Vegas hotel and conference center like the Venetian, the trains rarely
  run on time. Getting a car. Getting to a booth. Getting coffee. They all take way
  longer than you would expect. It can rattle you if you’re used to things running
  on a schedule. I’ll give HIMSS credit in that sessions usually do stick to their
  assigned time slots. It’s everything else that gets off the rails. The best advice
  is to relax and be patient. You’ll get that car or coffee eventually, and there’s
  precious little you can do to make it any better. Embrace the chaos and enjoy the
  spectacle of HIT’s annual Lollapalooza.\n\n## Get out of the Venetian\n\nIf you
  don’t have to be at the Venetian for an event at a set place (including booth time),
  go somewhere else. I’ve probably been to conferences at the Venetian 5-6 times,
  and it still confuses me how to get around. It’s vast so getting out is a commitment
  and likely something you’ll want to do at the start (breakfast) or end of the day.
  Getting out of the Venetian helps me to maintain my sanity and remember there is
  a real world out there where every conversation you hear isn't about Epic or [FHIR](https://datica.com/guide/fhir/)
  or population health. The one caveat to this is if you’re dead set on mingling and
  trying to network in the hopes that you hit it off with the anonymous person you
  meet at the Venetian \n\n## Avoid the main entrances\n\nAs I wrote above, the Venetian
  is large, and the bowels are confusing to navigate. If you can find a way to avoid
  the main ways in or out, you’ll find shorter coffee and drink lines. The worst times
  for the main arteries into the Venetian are, not surprisingly, around the conference
  schedules. Attendees tend to follow schedules, especially for exhibit hall opening
  times and keynotes. If you can, you’re better off going early or late to avoid the
  rush.\n\n## Buffer your time\n\nI’d estimate less than 25% of my scheduled HIMSS
  meetings, not sessions, start on time. The exhibit hall is massive, so people always
  underestimate how long they need between meetings. The good part is, everybody at
  HIMSS knows that HIMSS is challenging so most people expect a certain portion of
  meetings to start late, get rescheduled, or to not start at all.\n\n## Bring a battery
  backup\n\nThe bowels of the Venetian, deep in the exhibit hall and session rooms,
  have spotty mobile coverage. Couple that with the hordes of people sharing the mobile
  networks and your phone will eat a lot of battery establishing and re-establishing
  connections. Wall outlets are popular to combat this. Having a battery backup is
  super convenient if you want your phone to be on all day.\n\n## Bring good shoes\n\nI
  usually average 15-20k steps a day at HIMSS. I don’t attend many sessions, so I’m
  on my feet pretty much all day. Comfortable shoes help make this a lot more pleasant.\n\n##
  Take notes\n\nI used to take notes religiously when I wrote for [HIStalk](https://histalk2.com)
  because I’d write up daily summaries of the conference each night. As an aside,
  the people at HIStalk deserve a ton of credit for reporting on HIMSS; it’s a herculean
  task and makes me feel bad about my HIMSS whining in this post. I still write notes
  today, and if you see me next week, I’ll have my notebook with me. I take notes
  on people I meet and market intelligence related to Datica. There’s a lot to see
  and take in at HIMSS, too much for me to remember without notes.\n\n## Get some
  swag\n\nI usually try to get things for my kids and my wife to reduce my guilt from
  being away. One of my favorites was touchscreen gloves from [Imprivata](https://www.imprivata.com).
  I also try to get as many stuffed fish as I can from [PilotFish](https://www.pilotfishtechnology.com),
  though they’ve made it harder each year to get multiple fish. Every year there is
  new and exciting stuff to be had in the HIMSS exhibit hall. Not objective, but if
  you want the best swag in 2018, stop by the Datica booth (booth 5077) and check
  out our [Yeti](https://www.yeti.com) cups.\n\n## Balance your caffeine intake\n\nHIMSS
  is like [coffee-obsessed Seattle](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/food/coffee-culture-seattle)
  to me in that I always feel over-caffeinated by late morning or early afternoon.
  When this happens, especially if I’m not hydrating, I feel pretty crappy. My goal
  this year is to limit my caffeine intake for 2-3 cups a day, which isn't too far
  off from my normal caffeine schedule. The Datica booth is going to be stocked with
  cold brew coffee for our team and those that stop by (booth 5077) so I’m hopeful
  my willpower overcomes the ease of caffeine access next week.\n\n## Keep smiling\n\nI
  have a lot of friends in HIT and enjoy running into people at HIMSS. It’s the one
  event each year where I get a chance to bump into specific people. As exhausting
  as the week is, it’s only really four days (M-Th) so smile and get through it.\n\n\nI
  hope to see you at HIMSS! Look for me at the Datica booth, #5077, or on Tuesday,
  March 6th at 11:00am in the Amazon Booth, #1625, for a talk I'm giving about HITRUST
  on AWS. \n\n\n\n\n"

  :blog_lead: |-
    HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

    AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
  :post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
    healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time
    again.\n\nInnovative health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying
    to adopt AWS:\n\n1. **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push
    projects to internally owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving
    to the cloud, those initiatives can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the
    DevOps and cloud engineering resources needed outside of their control.\n\n2.
    **Internal Compliance does not approve of the low levels of liability taken on
    by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
    roughly 1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical
    level and firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's
    responsibility. Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned
    with Internal Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector.
    While AWS themselves have some of the best infrastructure security measures in
    the world, the operating system level is still the responsibility now of the organization
    to secure. That's a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem
    requiring hard-to-find resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll
    combined, most healthcare enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas,
    Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur,
    articulated this exact pain while giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe
    width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n##
    Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST
    has been a godsend.\n\nFor three years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified
    on top of AWS. Our Platform absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the
    cloud, which extends AWS's excellent coverage for compliance **of** the cloud.
    \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
    enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
    internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
    projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
    the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
    \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
    Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and
    compliance in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe
    result is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are
    making a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n##
    Live presentation for those who can't make it at HIMSS\n\nIf you are not attending
    HIMSS this year, or if you are unable to make the 11:00 am time slot on Tuesday,
    March 6th, we are holding a 30-minute webinar later in March to expand on Travis'
    presentation. Please join us if you can't visit us in person at HIMSS.\n\n[Visit
    our webinar overview to register for the March 21st presentation at 12:00 pm CST.](https://content.datica.com/hitrust-on-aws-2018-03-21)\n\nWhile
    you’re at HIMSS make sure to also visit the Datica booth, #5077. See you at HIMSS!\n\n\n"

  :summary: 'The buzz at HIMSS 2017: analytics, machine learning, AI, cyber-security,
    patient-centered care, and open data were a few themes we saw this year.'
  :blog_lead: "[HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/) is done. It’s time for
    the outpouring of commentaries on the event. And, amazingly, it’s already time
    to be thinking about next year if you’re an exhibitor. I realize the big companies
    do this but, at Datica, we too are planning and already booked our booth for next
    year. Thankfully we got a good booth space on the top floor and not in the basement
    (Vegas needs 2 levels to support HIMSS whereas Orlando only needs one massive
    level)."
  :post: "\n## Major Themes\n\nYou could have predicted these going into the event
    based on the sessions and promotional material.\n\n- **Analytics / machine learning
    / AI**. If I was to only pick one theme this year, this would be it. From Watson
    to Health Catalyst to the population health offerings of pretty much every EHR
    vendor, some form of analytics was woven into everything this year. Like patient
    engagement, a recurring HIMSS theme, [data analytics](https://datica.com/blog/3-benefits-of-accessible-big-data-analytics/)
    is seen as a major part of the future of care. Analytics does hold amazing potential
    but, like patient engagement, health systems need to develop strategies for how
    and where to use analytics if they are going to be successful. Analytics for analytics
    sake won’t help. Understanding the problems to solve or questions to answer with
    analytics is the key first step.\n- **Cybersecurity**. As more and more traditional
    health data goes digital, and more and more digital health data is generated by
    sensors and apps, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger topic. More health data flowing
    into more places means more financial risk of a [data breach](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/).
    Cybersecurity is an essential part of digital health, just like cloud is an essential
    part of digital health. This should be a recurring theme of HIMSS as the next
    10 years are going to be defined by healthcare moving data between new technologies
    and between new partnerships.\n- **Patient-centered care**. This is the one I
    wasn’t sure if I should include because I feel like some variation of this has
    been a recurring theme. I guess being a constant theme still makes it a theme.
    The idea of [patient centricity](https://datica.com/blog/the-cmio-role-in-the-era-of-value-based-care/),
    maybe because it has been a constant theme, is starting to mature. Services need
    to be centered on patients, and many of those services will be technology driven.
    The reason for services need to be patient-centered is 1) that’s what patients
    expect today and 2) that is what providers, payors, and life sciences need to
    do to compete for patients, members, and customers. I think we’ve swung back from
    the days when we thought B2C, or going direct to consumer, would work across most
    patient populations. Groups like Healthgrades still own a lot of consumer health
    traffic but integrating those consumer tools with providers and more formal care
    is also a part of patient centricity. \n- **Open data**. This one definitely isn’t
    new. I remember hearing [Todd Park beating the drum about *data liberación*](http://healthstandards.com/blog/2015/06/23/data-liberacion/)
    back in 2011. It only took three more years for most EHR vendors to start to get
    behind a new standard called FHIR and another three or so years, until today,
    when EHRs are ready to expose data via FHIR. I’m bullish on FHIR as a potential
    data standard but highly skeptical of FHIR as a path to open data and innovation.
    We have projects like Argonaut driving towards new ways to use FHIR so we’ll have
    to wait and see how those develop. The overwhelming sentiment around open data
    is that access to data, ideally in a trusted and consistent bi-directional way,
    is the only way to build the technology ecosystem that’s needed to put patients
    at the center of care and start to drive towards the [triple aim].\n\n## Same
    same, but different\n\nThere’s a saying I first heard in Thailand and use from
    time to time - [*same same but different*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish).
    I think it pretty accurately describes my impression of HIMSS 2017.\n\nStepping
    back, looking at HIMSS as a whole, it felt like we had simply transported all
    the infrastructure and logistics from Vegas in 2016 to Orlando in 2017. It didn’t
    really feel too [much different from HIMSS 2015](https://datica.com/blog/himss-2015-recap/),
    for that matter. [HIStalkapalooza](https://datica.com/blog/visit-the-datica-vip-area-at-histalkapalooza-2017/)
    happened. The Athena party happened. Lots of bankers parties with better food
    and drink options. Uber didn’t work well. Restaurants were full all the time.
    Epic, Cerner, Athena and a few others still had the largest booths. Yeah, it felt
    like HIMSS.\n\nBut then, in other ways, it felt very different from previous years.
    The impression I got, on a consistent basis, is that people are burned out on
    the status quo. People are tired of HIMSS being the same year after year. People
    are tired of \"doing things to check boxes\", a reference to buying EHRs to get
    money from Meaningful Use, and \"want to really start making things happen\".
    These quotes are from people at large health systems, people in the same roles
    that would have said something like \"Epic is going to do that\" when asked about
    patient engagement or population health or pretty much anything health IT just
    a few years ago. These are decision makers at the core of the health IT industry
    and not just startups and investors. The tide has very clearly turned in the industry.\n\nThis
    is exciting! It will take time to see how quickly this sea change practically
    takes hold and we start to see more and more digital health technologies adopted
    and scaled at health systems. But, the process is starting and big systems are
    developing strategies and processes for the next 3-5 years. And, maybe the most
    shocking part, especially compared to several years ago, is that health systems
    are looking outside their EHR vendors for the future of health IT.\n\n*Want to

  :summary: 'Casey Bryson shares visions of healthcare''s digital future from HIMSS
    2017, including applications that scale and integrate with EHRs at lightning speed. '
  :blog_lead: "I am a visionary. I do not consider myself an entrepreneur. The team
    that surrounds me, my colleagues at Datica and our company advisors, build my
    entrepreneurial skills with each day that passes. \n "
  :post: "At [HIMSS 2017](http://www.himssconference.org/), I surrounded myself with
    visionaries. I met with leaders of technology companies and healthcare providers.
    We shared our visions for the future of our industry and our conversations fuel
    how we build and execute our strategies. Most discussions focused on the forces
    pushing our industry to adopt SaaS solutions for digital health that improve patient
    outcomes, deliver excellent customer service, and create new models of care. The
    future vision includes applications that scale and integrate with EHRs at lightning
    speed. One quote I overheard said it best:\n\n> “We will be able to snap solutions
    on and off quickly to prove the concept and to find speed to value.”\n \nAs I
    reflect on my time on the exhibit hall floor at HIMSS it is clear that our industry’s
    digital culture is hyper-focused on the speed of innovation. For these visionaries,
    the future is very close. For other visionaries that don't share this focus, the
    future may be a frightening place.\n \nI got my start in HIT by installing [Health
    Information Management (HIM) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_information_management).
    I worked with HIM professionals across the country to define, produce, and protect
    the sanctity of the legal medical record. As I had a break in my schedule I decided
    to pop into an educational session led by an HIM director who I had met in my
    previous life. The topic was information governance; an enterprise, top-down approach
    to hard cost savings tied to managing information as a critical asset. [As AHIMA
    states](http://www.ahima.org/topics/infogovernance/igbasics), \n\n> “IG serves
    the dual purpose of optimizing the ability to extract clinical and business value
    from healthcare information while simultaneously meeting compliance needs and
    mitigating risk.”  \n\n## My vision for the future has been enhanced\n \nThe future
    of digital health must include information governance. It starts with process
    and a line of questioning but many questions should be eliminated by a standard
    approach by information technology. \n\n- What does this application do? \n- Does
    it integrate with my EHR? \n- Does the vendor manage patient identity or encounter/contact
    moves?\n- How do I process data corrections? \n- How do I limit the risk of e-discovery?
    \n- Is this data part of our Legal Medical Record or Designated Record Set? \n-
    How will I manage all of these questions as the speed of digital health and departmental
    applications become more of a reality?\n\nThe core of Datica’s mission is to help
    our clients do what they do, better, by eliminating barriers to digital adoption.
    If your desire is speed to value, IT and HIM have to work in harmony.\n \nMy vision
    for the future of digital health includes IT systems being armed with a partner
    to manage backups, encryption, patient identity, data retention policies, and
    focus on data integration from the need to drive workflow and to support the production
    of the record. \n\nI may not be an entrepreneur historically but my team has taught
    me that you have to focus on your core competencies to arrive at greatness, otherwise,
    you will end up being mediocre at everything. If you’d like to discuss health
    information management as we move toward a digital environment, drop me a line

    width=\"120\" class=\"float-left-on-medium\" />\n\nHIMSS 2018 saw the presence
    of three of the largest tech companies in the world flex their muscles. The event
    itself is evidence that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.\n\n##
    The 3 largest tech companies flex their muscles at HIMSS\n\n### Microsoft showcased
    Azure at HIMSS\n\nDue to their rich health IT history, Microsoft has engaged with
    HIMSS in the past, but the company’s positioning in 2018 is noteworthy. A through
    line across its booth facilities, its engagements, and in 1:1 conversations was
    a focus on modernizing health IT via intelligent solutions. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) certainly had a presence, but it was grounded in usable tools like Office
    365 and Microsoft Teams. Any cloud reference had less to do with Azure itself
    and more to do with Microsoft solutions on the cloud. \n\n### AWS went big HIMSS\n\nFor
    the first time in its history, AWS went big with an impressive HIMSS booth. This
    major physical presence is the only major one in healthcare outside of their own
    re:Invent conference. AWS had a mix of solution architecture Q&A, presentations
    from its broad partner ecosystem, and demonstrations of healthcare-specific cloud
    solutions available on AWS. Its 2018 presence showed AWS cares about being active
    in health IT and [AWS has a strong story to tell](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-on-aws-is-possible-find-out-how-at-himss18/)
    with both new digital health companies and enterprise health IT. \n\n### Google
    went all out at HIMSS\n\nBut then we have Google. It also spent big — much bigger
    than Microsoft or AWS. Google had a major booth, but also several keynotes and
    high profile sessions that all must have cost enormous amounts in sponsorships.
    Of the three, it’s easy to see through total spend and coverage that Google is
    making the biggest bet that its cloud offerings can help healthcare. The only
    problem is understanding the actionable theme Google had in mind. Is it looking
    to help hospitals migrate old systems to Google’s cloud? Is it trying to get AI
    adopted in enterprises? The most consistent message centered on helping smaller
    startups succeed, which is then curious why Google would spend so much money getting
    in front of hospital CIOs. \n\nThe aggregate observation is big tech is looking
    to spend big dollars to land a big presence with this big event. All are here
    to stay this time. \n\n## Healthcare innovation was everywhere at HIMSS18\n\n###
    Certain innovations are now mature \n\nFrom the presence of the booths, the coverage
    within sessions, and the chatter amongst attendees, two major areas of innovation
    have finally made it: telehealth and population health. \nThose who follow healthcare
    know these two areas aren’t new, per se. But that’s not the point. The key observation
    from HIMSS18 is that, in the aggregate, all companies have “made it.” Their spend
    was enormous, their booths packed, their messages grand, and their sessions well
    attended. For upwards of a decade, we’ve talked about the eventuality of both
    telehealth and population health. Well, HIMSS18 proved to us that the companies
    that figured out the models have finally crested the mountain in that long journey,
    and are now part of the health IT regulars. \n\n### The startups are mostly focused
    on AI \n\nMost early-stage companies were predominantly downstairs in the startup
    hub, but some were upstairs as well. Regardless of the location, a clear and obvious
    trend prevailed: Artificial Intelligence. AI is coming to healthcare. When it
    arrives, we aren’t certain. Much like telehealth, its timing will likely be tied
    to payment structures and when healthcare systems are allowed to receive reimbursement
    for its use. But the sheer volume of AI-focused business, products, and tools
    staggered attendees and it felt inevitable that AI will disrupt healthcare in
    some capacity. Our guess is that many net-new products will be deployed over the
    next two years, will show demonstrative impact, and then after that a larger watershed,
    will happen similarly to what we saw with telehealth and population health. \n\n###
    Net-new innovation is more popular on the cloud than migrating old systems \n\nLastly,
    we saw the [healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/) as
    a mixed bag at HIMSS18. Conversation after conversation indicated a resistance
    to migrating old systems to the cloud. Ultimately, CIOs aren’t interested in the
    downside — higher hidden costs than the cloud vendor space indicates, high probability
    of downtime or failure of fragile systems during migration, and general unease
    with understanding risks and liabilities yet on the cloud. \n\nDatica ran a CHIME
    focus group with 18 hospital and health system CIOs. Across the board, their sentiment
    remained the same. Migration of existing systems just isn’t a priority. \nOn the
    flip side, much innovation is happening with new projects. These innovations can
    either be in the form of digital health products CIOs are purchasing, or as internal
    projects led by innovation groups. The cloud is not universally bad in the eyes
    of hospital CIOs. In fact, all 18 voiced the priority of cloud-first innovations
    when evaluating new tools or solutions. \nThis dichotomy became one of the more
    interesting observations from HIMSS18. You might also want to take a look at the
    thorough recap and analysis of that [CHIME focus group here](https://datica.com/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).\n\n###
    More internal innovation is happening than many realize \n\nOne interesting thread
    throughout the entire conference hinged on the consistency of internal innovation
    being a focus. More conversations led to CIOs or innovation directors looking
    to internal resources for solving a specific problem at their system as opposed
    to buying a new product. \n\nIt’s not just centered with innovation groups, either.
    We were shocked to hear stories of how some institutions are completely rethinking
    innovation from the ground up, giving smaller teams more democracy in those innovations.
    The head of dermatology might be working on her own sanctioned project to innovate
    on a problem. The chief nursing officer might have the job of marshalling a skunkworks
    team to build a new tool for nurses. And so on. It’s happening across the country.
    \n\nIt’s great to see such innovation products constantly entering the health
    IT space. The level of sophistication in just the last few years has jumped considerably
    and will likely continue it’s rapid improvement through the coming years. \n\n\n"

    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###
    HIPAA Resources\n\n* [Understanding Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/)\n*
    [Datica HIPAA Mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)\n* [Learn the basics of HIPAA](https://datica.com/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/)\n*
    [Whis is HIPAA Important?](http://content.datica.com/why-is-hipaa-important )\n*

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###

    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
