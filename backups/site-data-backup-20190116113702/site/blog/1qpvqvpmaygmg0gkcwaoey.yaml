  into the topic of how healthcare compliance has evolved in the cloud era. '
:blog_lead: In 2013, when the final HIPAA Omnibus was ruled, compliance on the cloud
  was an opaque understanding. It took collaboration among cloud services providers
  such as AWS, Azure, and Google, digital health companies like Datica, and the good
  folks at HITRUST and Coalfire (among many deserving others) to collectively define
  what it meant.
:post: |2

  The process has been hard. Along the way, we learned a lot while also building little mental models or explanations to help distill the evolving complexity into digestible chunks for those looking to make a dent in this industry. Many of those simplifications we put into our new book, [*Complete Cloud Compliance*](https://completecloudcompliance.com), which launched this month.

  The book tries to answer the question "What Really Is Compliance?" and we think we do a decent job for those who aren't a professional compliance officer. The concepts are familiar to those with deep compliance experience, but we believe are the most efficient explainer for those who truly aren't sure how to answer the question themselves. We thought, if we can help everyone else learn our compliance lessons over the past five years, we can make *our* dent in this industry.

  On Wednesday, September 26th, I'll be giving [a webinar where I dive deeper](https://datica.com/webinars/what-really-is-compliance/) into the topic. I will be summarizing many key concepts throughout the book. For those who have 45 minutes open over lunchtime, I encourage you to attend.

  A few big ideas we will explore tomorrow:

  * Compliance is not the same as security is not the same as privacy
  * Rules and controls are very different, and it's important to understand that
  * The faster you can map the difference between organizations, standards, frameworks, and regulations, the faster all these acronyms will make sense to you
  * The global nature of compliance
  * Why frameworks matter
  * How to map a compliance regime onto your cloud architecture

  Please join me on Wednesday. Feedback is always welcome!

    ## Why we wrote a book

    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?fm=jpg&w=150&q=20" class="float-right lozad" data-src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d4Dorm3y8w8Kq4SMMcSg4/276048f29cea4f1c07c6aa730f60353f/compliance_book__3d_front_and_back_mockup.png?w=300" width="150" alt="Complete Cloud Compliance Book" />

    In 2013, when Datica was founded as [Catalyze](https://datica.com/catalyze), the cloud was a simpler place. AWS was the only public cloud that signed a meaningful [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/), but they only had a handful of services (or "primitives") within scope. Even so, to sign the BAA, which was under NDA, required customers use dedicated instances which meant digital health companies had to spend a minimum $1,400 per month just to get started — and that doesn’t even account for the cost to solve [the remaining 9/10ths of compliance](https://datica.com/compliant-kubernetes-service/aws/). Docker wasn't yet version 1.0, and [Kubernetes](https://datica.com/blog/kubernetes-vs-paas/) wasn't even a thing yet. The term "microservices" meant nothing. Modern container-based cloud architectures that were fully HIPAA compliant and could be HITRUST CSF Certified were impossible on the public cloud until [Catalyze's first platform-as-a-service product](https://datica.com/press-release/catalyze-closes-series-a-funding-to-expand-development-of-its-healthcare-platform/) came along.

    Fast forward to 2018, and the cloud is a very different place. __We are now living in a post-cloud world.__ That post-cloud world is built on managed services. AWS is now up to hundreds of these services and dozens within scope of their BAA. Azure and GCP sign rock-solid BAAs consisting of just as many world-class services and all three are competing to be a viable destination for digital health workloads. Many independent managed services, like MongoDB's Atlas, sign BAAs now, too. The typical cloud architecture is a constellation of managed services using a microservices-based scheme. Just the other day, I was speaking to a digital health developer who mentioned his company uses the basics like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway, but is using BigQuery on GCP for machine learning and investigating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Cosmos as an eventual Kubernetes destination, while also incorporating MongoDB Atlas, Auth0, and a handful of independent logging and monitoring services. Whew. This is not manic decision making. This is the new normal.

    > Compliance has not kept up. We know this first hand.

    The issues are foundational, from our experience. Compliance officers are often attorneys and not technologists so they have a hard time grasping how fast abstraction on the cloud is moving. Likewise, engineers are not legal scholars, so they have a tough time wrapping their heads around a proper compliance program that is the difference between their app being adopted by hospitals or dying on the vine. I still personally have about one conversation a day with a developer where I have to coach them that [HIPAA is a government regulation](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) while [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) is a certification framework.

    In 2013, the cloud was built for an operator archetype, the type of employee who could secure Virtual Machines (VMs) and contribute to a compliance program. After five years, the cloud is now designed for developers who can easily interchange services with a few clicks. What we are seeing is this new archetype is not ready for security and compliance in a managed services world. All we have to do is look around to find news stories of the situation. [Just last month, an improperly configured AWS S3 bucket lead to 31,000 GoDaddy servers to be exposed](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/09/amazon-aws-error-exposes-31-000-godaddy-servers/).

    These foundational challenges are why we wrote _Complete Cloud Compliance_. Our goal is always to help the healthcare community, but educating people on such heady topics extended beyond a blog post or online knowledge base. A book proved to be the right medium. Travis Good (Datica CEO) and I started the writing process earlier this year with the first edition printed last month.

    ## Structure of the book

    The book starts out with a basic introduction then flows into the following chapter setup:

    1. __The Business Case for Compliance__ — an examination on why compliance actually matters to regulated companies like digital health.
    2. __[What _Really_ is Compliance?](https://datica.com/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/)__ — We tried very hard to be simple and concise while also educating complex topics to those who are fresh to the respective domains. Consequently, this chapter breaks down critical compliance concepts with a developer reader in mind, meaning compliance officers will find the content familiar. Feedback from developers has been fantastic, however.
    3. __What _Really_ is the Cloud?__ — The cloud is not a computer in somebody else's data center. It's software-enabled infrastructure services built for software developers. This chapter was written for this post-cloud world, but it does lay some basic foundational concepts to help educate business folks. Feedback from engineers to compliance officers to business users has been very positive.
    4. __Why Data Interoperability Matters__ — Readers will find a consistent theme throughout the book: data is splintering, not consolidating, which makes compliance even harder. This chapter uses healthcare to explain how interoperability matters to compliance.
    5. __Complete Cloud Compliance__ — After the context is set, we give a detailed overview on how regulated companies can employ a compliance program that genuinely gives them dynamic, continuous compliance on an ever-changing cloud. We call the program Complete Cloud Compliance, as the book title implies, and 3C for short throughout.
    6. __Best Practices for Complete Cloud Compliance__ — With the 3C program in mind, we then provide a few dozen best practice pieces of advice for managing compliance on the cloud.
    7. __The Achievable Mandate__ — Readers within regulated companies should not fear the future, but embrace it because it's critical for survival. The good news is controlling compliance on the cloud is possible.

    ## Visually explaining compliance

    The book is purposefully very visual. The reasoning is pretty simple. Ultimately, this is a very boring and very complex topic. We don't pretend that this is the most exciting domain just because we live in it everyday. No, compliance is mind-numbingly boring.

    But it is critical to the future success of regulated companies, and by extension digital health. We fundamentally believe that unless healthcare can get on the cloud, it is at grave risk of falling even further behind, to which compliance is a blocker.

    To combat the boring nature of our lovable domain, we went heavy on visual storytelling. Readers will find sprinkled throughout the book several infographics geared as simplifying extremely complex topics. We think it worked well.

    Take this image for example. In chapter two (which is downloadable at the end of this post), we break down the differences between regulations, standards developing organizations, standards themselves, and frameworks. When we get to the frameworks section, we wanted to make clear that it is wise to work with frameworks that are built for the future, to which HITRUST is a good choice. When demonstrating the point, we charted the lineage of influences dating back almost a century that went into HITRUST's CSF. We thought it told an interesting story.

    ## The 9 Big Ideas

    Woven throughout the book are nine big ideas, many of which are brand-new ways of thinking by Datica that we are thrilled to start to share with the community. They are:

    1.  [When controlled, compliance is actually a competitive edge.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-a-competitive-edge-cee13073cf54 "Read more on this topic")
    2.  [The cloud is no longer other people's computers. It is managed services.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/the-cloud-is-software-for-developers-not-hardware-for-operations-9503c0e3e86 "Read more on this topic")
    3.  [As cloud services get more abstract to improve developer experience (a good thing), more control is being taken away from the user making compliance attestation harder (a bad thing).](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/shared-responsibility-on-the-cloud-a-solution-for-managed-services-or-opacity-for-cloud-customers-fc01fbe18897 "Read more on this topic")
    4.  [Compliance is only as strong as the weakest link in the abstraction chain.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/abstraction-on-the-cloud-increases-the-risk-of-weak-links-4641e20c0bbc "Read more on this topic")
    5.  Frameworks are the best way to manage regulations. The best frameworks are built for a dynamic future, not a dated past.
    6.  Complete cloud compliance is hard because technologists struggle to understand compliance while compliance officers struggle to understand the cloud.
    7.  [The cloud is global, so compliance is now global.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/compliance-is-now-global-because-the-cloud-is-global-d938de1626ea "Read more on this topic")
    8.  [Cloud compliance comes down to data management. The three verbs of data are store, compute, and transmit.](https://medium.com/complete-cloud-compliance/from-ehrs-to-data-driven-healthcare-c33e0e27ee95 "Read more on this topic")
    9.  Data sources are splintering instead of unifying, making compliance more complex.

    You will see us publish more about these big ideas throughout 2018.

  :post: |-
    This new chapter of the Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF) will take you through the steps needed to prove your application works — from your first month in business all the way to the twenty-second. Here's what you'll learn, month-by-month in the [Evidence](/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea) section.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-validating-the-idea" title="DSHF Evidence: Validating the idea" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 1</a></div>

    ### Validating the idea

    There are a lot of things broken in healthcare and few areas where you can say that care is optimized for patients, let alone providers. The challenge is that there are some strong industry debts, or ingrained impediments, that make some improvements in care unrealistic, especially on aggressive timelines.

    Because of this, the first step in a digital health evidence strategy is to engage with an expert, typically a care provider, champion, or administrator. The outcome of this engagement should be either 1) feedback to adjust the idea and assumptions underlying the digital health product or 2) an expert opinion, ideally in the form of a quote that can be used publicly, in support of the digital health product.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-develop-evidence-roadmap" title="DSHF Evidence: Develop an evidence roadmap" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 3</a></div>

    ### Develop an evidence roadmap

    Not all digital health product categories are created equal when it comes to evidence. The important thing to understand at this stage is how the different kinds of evidence apply to your product. If your product is integrated into care, like a digital therapeutic or a care management platform, then moving towards peer-reviewed evidence in support of the way your product improves outcomes, is necessary. If your product helps to fill empty slots in schedules, you likely won’t ever need to worry about peer-reviewed evidence but you will need to build a body of evidence from real customer data to support your claims of spots filled or recovering of lost revenue.

    It’s at this point that you want to roughly map out your evidence roadmap, which is simply a timeline of when you expect, or hope, to have different levels of evidence. Like a product roadmap, it’s going to be goal-oriented in that you need to back into timelines based on your goal delivery dates for different kinds of evidence.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-create-evidence-collateral" title="DSHF Evidence: Create collateral on evidence for  your product" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 6</a></div>

    ### Create collateral on evidence for  your product

    It would be nice to have a NEJM or JAMA article in support of your product but that’s highly unlikely at this stage of your journey. The goal at this stage is to empower your customer-facing teams with clear and concise collateral containing data about the benefits of your product from real-world applications.

    One additional thing to consider at this stage is customizing evidence collateral for your intended audiences. Maybe you only have one buyer but it’s likely there are other people involved in the buying process, especially if you’re selling to enterprises. Think about ways you can tailor the data, maybe even just the data you highlight, for different audiences.

    <div markdown="0"><a href="/dhsf#evidence-applying-healthcare-economics" title="DSHF Evidence: Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution" class="subheader-small text--blue">Month 12</a></div>

    ### Apply healthcare economics to your digital health solution

    Healthcare economics is focused, at a high level, on the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare — everything from prevention and delivery to collections. [Wikipedia has a good primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics), though you could get a Ph.D. in healthcare economics because it’s that big of a subject.

    The thing that’s hard about healthcare economics is that what seems like a perfectly logical reason to implement a digital health solution, namely because it would result in better care, less expensive overall costs, and clear ROI, doesn’t always make sense.

    You’ll need to understand where and how economic benefits are realized. Many digital health solutions, especially those that target improving outcomes, benefit payors and not health care delivery organizations. This is changing with models that pay for value and not volume, things like readmission penalties and ACOs, but healthcare today largely still operates on volume and not value.

    ### Add credibility and weight to your evidence

    By this time, you should have traction and will be looking to add new customers and implementations for your digital health product. At this stage, you should be thinking about how to expand the collateral you have already created by adding credibility.

    The best way is getting something published on your evidence. This doesn’t have to be in a peer-reviewed clinical journal but could be an online publication. Think of health management publications like Health Affairs. Or, it could simply be joint collateral with one of your customers.

    top of the public cloud.

    ## Best practices are best practices

    Compliance is global, however, with highly regulated industries spanning many geographies. The requirements to meet [GDPR regulations](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/) by May 25th pushed us to examine a compliance posture that was international instead of HIPAA specific.

    The nearly year-long exercise was a catalyst for our compliance team to innovate on how we could be bigger than just GDPR. We took a look at compliance holistically, and globally, to come up with a strategy that will allow us to better serve customers across industries and geographies.

    The result is simplified with a phrase we use internally: _Best Practices are Best Practices_.

    ## The Datica global compliance roadmap

    Datica's ability to serve international compliance regimes stems from a philosophy exemplified by [HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/): one framework, many regimes. We decided to take a single compliance framework, make it our root attestation, and then plan to use it as a repeatable mapping process towards other regimes. HITRUST and its Common Security Framework was clearly the answer.

    HITRUST has done a great job of aiming for big goals. With version 9.1 of the CSF, we believe there are few better options for the most stringent and comprehensive compliance auditing framework on the cloud. The HITRUST CSF is our DNA framework.

    By using HITRUST, we will crosswalk the CSF to other geographies and compliance regimes, thus accelerating our ability to support compliance attestations in those areas. Certainly unique considerations will exist in respective geographies before we can officially support compliant deployments of the Datica Platform in a country, but the CSF will get us almost all the way there in all cases.

    As has been the drumbeat since [Datica's founding in 2013](https://datica.com/about/), transparency is the key to distilling the complexity of compliance. Transparency is how we best help healthcare — and other regulated industries — move forward. To communicate our global compliance posture to both present and future customers, we built a handy table that documents our compliance roadmap.

    <img class="lozad group" data-src="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=600" data-srcset="//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png?w=800 1000w, //images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4KtjQwGLOo6UGoAY82qe6k/dd058456a0fef3d725cd5fc8a1713840/global_compliance_stance_table.png 1200w" alt="global compliance stance table" />

    The table is simple:

    * We list geographies and certain regimes that matter in those geographies.
    * One column states if that regime is currently supported by the platform.
    * Another column states if we have plans to support it someday.
    * And lastly, for those we plan to support, we give a broad estimation to when the HITRUST crosswalk will be done along with any additional specific requirements for the respective regime.

    This table will be updated a lot throughout 2018 as we test our compliance posture against new regimes.

    We invite you to take a look at public global compliance roadmap by visiting the [Global Compliance Posture](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance/global/) page of our website.

    In short, we plan to take HITRUST global to both geographies and regimes that we haven't previously supported. We want to be the best compliance management option for cloud native applications across the world.

    executive liability stipulates an ongoing effort for assessment to create a first-class

    to the health insurance systemization that was already inundated with federal
    mandates. For example:\n\n* All departments and serviceable groups that deal with
    PHI will be observed with scrutiny for HIPAA compliance.\n* Policies in relation
    to HIPAA compliance must be written and documented, but employees are required
    to be trained on them whilst also having an expounded privacy officer accountable
    for managing the enterprise's HIPAA compliance.\n* Noncompliance penalties have
    not been fully systematized but risk of press coverage and detrimental consumer
    perceptions cannot be overlooked. \n\nThe required HIPAA Compliance Assessment
    is intentioned to be brief, concise, and extensive. A complete assessment will
    include these measures:\n\n* Recognize state of readiness for all facets of HIPAA
    - privacy, security, and transactional\n* Ascertain areas of preeminent risk\n*
    Facilitate ongoing regulatory compliance\n* Offer insights into efficiency and

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
