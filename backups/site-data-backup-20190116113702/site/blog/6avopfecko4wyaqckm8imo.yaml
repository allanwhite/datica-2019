:summary: 'HL7 message senders should get an HL7 ACK message in return. This article
  explains what ACK NACK means and the requirements for ACK and NACK messages. '
:blog_lead: "In a two-way communication system that is properly using the HL7 standards,
  a receiving system will send an HL7 ACK (acknowledgement) message to the sending
  system to notify that the message was effectively received. In an archetypal HL7
  environment, the sending system will presume the message was not received up until
  the delivery of an ACK message is made from the receiving system. By way of explanation,
  if the receiver does not return the ACK message, the sender may safely assume there
  is an error and halt message transmissions. \n"
:post: "### ACK Message Anatomy\n\nHere is an example of an HL7 ACK message:\n\n```\nMSH|^~\\&|APPLICATION|HOSPITAL|Catalyze|INC|201513112402||ACK|MSGID5183033|P|2.4|\nMSA|AA|MSGID5183033\n```\n\nIt
  is clear that this message consists of two segments: message header (MSH) and message
  acknowledgement (MSA). MSH segments indicate what application or facility generated
  the message, unique ID for send message, and indicates what version of HL7 the message
  complies with. MSA segments determine what message is being acknowledged and if
  it was successfully processed and received. Inside an MSA segment are two types
  of relevant information: acknowledgement code, indicating if the message was successfully
  processed and received, and message control ID, denoting the unique ID of the acknowledged
  message. \n\n### Requirements of an ACK message\n\n- Message is in HL7 format.\n-
  The value ‘AA’ is in MSA-1 (MSA segment, field number 1). ‘AA’ means that the receiving
  system successfully received the message.\n- The Message Control ID of the last
  message is in MSA-2 (MSA segment, field number 2). The original Message Control
  ID is found in MSH-10 (message segment, field number 10).\n\n### Values of MSA-1\n\n-
  AA - Application Accept (used for ACK)\n- AE - Application Error (used for NACK)\n-
  AR - Application Reject (used for NACK)\n\nMoreover, if the message was not successfully
  received, an HL7 NACK (negative acknowledgement) message is sent back to the sending
  system. A NACK informs the sending system that there was error in message processing.\n\n###
  Requirements of a NACK message\n\n- Message is in HL7 format.\n- The value ‘AE’
  or ‘AR’ is in MSA-1 (MSA segment, field number 1). AE is Application Error. AR is
  Application Reject.\n- The Message Control ID of the last message is in MSA-2 (MSA
  segment, field number 2). The original Message Control ID is found in MSH-10 (message
  segment, field number 10).\n\nIn short, standard HL7 protocol calls for ACKnowledgment
  protocol. Each time a system receives a message and processes the data, it is expected
  to send an ACKnowledgment message back to the sending system. The sending system
  is expected to keep on sending a message until it has received a ACK/NACK message.
  Without this standard enacted, data could be lost in transmission.\n\nIf you want
  to read more about HL7, check out some of our [HL7](/academy/hl7-101-a-primer) resources
  freely available in our [Academy](/academy).\n\n"

  :summary: In a short period of time, Datica has hit several major milestones. As
    of May 2015, we are excited to share that we are processing over 6 million HL7
    messages per month, with those numbers growing every day.
  :blog_lead: |
    Integration is a buzzword in healthcare, and for good reason.

    As the healthcare industry transforms from the traditional model of volume-based care to new models of value-based care, there is heightened interest in patient outcomes, patient engagement in decision making, and patient satisfaction. Executives know aggressive inclusion of novel third party tools that solve real problems is paramount to meeting new metrics. Integrating several third party vendors is hard enough, while scaling a sea change is untenable. No one wants to do inefficient one-offs until the end of time.
  :post: |
    Increasingly health systems and vendors are partnering with Datica to [accelerate third party integration](https://catalyze.io/hl7). Hospitals get an ROI from the streamlined workflows while vendors, like [HealthLoop](https://catalyze.io/proof), appreciate offloading this unique expertise. The end result is faster, reliable integration on compliant infrastructure. Major cost savings are instantly realized by all parties involved.

    In a short period of time, Datica has hit several major milestones. Today, we are excited to share that we are processing over 6 million HL7 messages per month, with those numbers growing every day. This is a testament to the trust health systems and vendors are both putting in our approach to compliance, and our dedication to the highest quality service.

    We reached this milestone by expediting integrations with most of the common HL7 interfaces we all know and love, including...

    * Inbound and Outbound Registration (ADT)
    * Scheduling (SIU)
    * Orders and Results (ORM/ORU)
    * Notes (MDM)
    * Discrete Data (ORU)
    * Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) through IHE standard queries

    ...plus FHIR, ASC X12 feeds for Claims, and a multitude of suboptimal data access methods like CSV files that still proliferate data integration in 2015.

    Our customers' business opportunities have driven us to integrating with over 60% of the EHR market, including Epic, Cerner, McKesson, eClinicalWorks, Allscripts—just to name a few.

    Over the next several months we will be sharing with you specific integration stories from real customers, outlining the clear benefits, in the words of our customers, of leveraging Datica for integration. Datica is committed to the future of healthcare, so we are excited to share genuine examples of bettering patient care.

  :summary: "$360,000! The cost for a maker of digital health products to design,
    implement, deploy and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own. Get the breakdown."
  :blog_lead: "$360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health
    products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their
    own. That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost
    of developing the technology for their own application. We often hear early-stage
    developers say they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using AWS. That’s
    when the steep education process begins to help them understand they’re just at
    the beginning of the compliance journey with AWS and there’s so much more to consider
    to build a compliant application in the cloud. "
  :post: "## The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison \n\nOur
    goal in building the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) was to reduce
    the barriers to compliance in the cloud for makers of digital health products.
    As part of that ongoing commitment to simplify healthcare's onramp to the cloud,
    we provide as much value as possible in the form of healthcare expertise we share
    freely with the market. It is our goal to enable our customers to focus their
    efforts away from compliance and cloud management and toward developing digital
    health applications that improve patient outcomes. \n\nThere’s much to know about
    both compliance and cloud management and that knowledge requires a significant
    investment in time, education, personnel, and money. The intent of our newest
    guide, [The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/),
    is to help makers of digital health products make informed decisions about whether
    to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in the form of the Datica
    Platform. \n\n***Spoiler Alert:** It’s 10x more cost-effective to contract with
    Datica to deploy your application on a made-for-healthcare platform that includes
    not only the AWS cloud infrastructure, but also all the DevOps, DevSecOps, expertise,
    and proof necessary to build and market a healthcare application.* \n\nThis guide
    explains the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and
    offers a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates
    for each of those considerations. We show how Datica addresses those requirements
    in some detail and how you as a customer benefit from building your application
    on the Datica Platform. These estimates are based on our extensive experience
    working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers
    (like [Amazon Web Services](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), Microsoft
    Azure, or IBM Softlayer).\n\n## Datica's Shared Responsibility Model\n\nIt’s important
    to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility model grants excellent
    security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible
    for security IN the cloud. Orchestrating DevSecOps is just as challenging as orchestrating
    DevOps. The following diagram explains that a bit more, but get the full story

  :summary: There's much a digital health company needs to know about EHR integrations.
    Here are 4 essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers.
  :blog_lead: 'During the past three years, we''ve done [a lot of integration work](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/success/).
    We''ve worked on more than 150 integration projects with almost 30 EHR vendors.
    We''ve done this work with big organizations and vendors to small FQHCs and niche
    EHR vendors. As a result of all this integration experience, we now have a pretty
    good grasp on the intricacies of how integration works. We can reasonably estimate
    how long it takes us to do a project and how that varies with different types
    of vendors. '
  :post: "> What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of
    a computer system. Some of them can be bent, others can be broken.\" -- Morpheus,
    The Matrix\n\nHowever, despite our progress, there are still hundreds of systems
    that we have not integrated with. In the ambulatory setting alone, there are more
    than 650 technologies certified for Meaningful Use Stage 2. While working with
    the top 30 already gives us a leg up and covers a majority of the industry, it's
    not uncommon for us to hear about a new piece of HIT technology that our customers
    and prospects are looking to integrate with. \n\nDespite your perceptions of us
    as an integration services team, we don't have any secret super powers to solve
    problems with interoperability. Our solution, as simple as it may sound, is just
    being the best at our specialized skill set as we can be. This means:\n\n- Writing
    interfaces and transforming data to programmer-friendly formats using Mirth, an
    open-source interface engine. \n- Setting up VPNs when needed on open-source Strongswan
    appliances.\n- Having a team of experts in health data and project management
    on hand to analyze project needs. \n- Everything hosted on the HITRUST-certified
    Datica Platform, staffed by a team of ops, security, and compliance experts. \n\nWhile
    we may know about obscure technologies that power integrations at a given EHR
    vendor, our process is likely similar to anyone else's when kicking off a project.
    As such, it's worth noting that **some projects may be impossible to complete**
    due to external constraints. Turns out that data blocking in healthcare is really
    a thing. So, if Datica is not helping you in your pre-sales process with customers,
    it's up to you to ask all the necessary questions to ensure that you will be able
    to successfully integrate your application with the EHR and site in question.
    \n\n## Four essential questions digital health teams should ask their customers\n\n###
    1) Can your EHR support my digital health product's scope?\n\n<img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png\"
    alt=\"XKCD comic on complexity\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\">\n\nThe most
    common data integration formats we use to exchange health data are [HL7v2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-201-the-admission-discharge-transfer-adt-message/)
    and CDA-formatted documents like CCDs and CCDAs. Even though these data formats
    are standards, this doesn't mean all EHRs support exchanging data through these
    formats. In fact, some EHRs have no integration capabilities at all. Make sure
    the EHR supports the data standards that you need. Particularly, make sure the
    EHR supports the data standards in the method you need them. For example, if you
    need CCDs *pushed* to you at the end of a visit vs. *pulling* them proactively,
    you will want to ensure the EHR has the capability to manage that process. There
    is a very real possibility here that the EHR may have no suitable integration
    technology, which may limit your data integration possibilities to flat-file style
    extracts or may require manual data entry to power your application.\n\nIt's worth
    noting that there are some integrations [that seem simple but are really complex](https://xkcd.com/1425/).
    For example, while it would seem obvious that any EHR could expose provider availability
    to schedule appointments, this is actually rare functionality. It's *easy* to
    know what appointments are scheduled/canceled but it's *hard* to know when you
    can schedule an appointment. Just because there are no appointments from 12:00-2:00
    doesn't mean the provider isn't doing hospital rounds or research. As such, what
    may have been an easy API query on Allscripts, Epic, and Athena turns into a nightmare
    of stored procedure R&D and database access requirements with smaller EHRs. This
    is why it's good to have experts on hand to help you understand the rules of the
    road and to match integration expectations to reality. \n\n\n### 2) Do you have
    the internal or external resources to perform the integration work?\n\nSmaller
    organizations may have an EHR with HL7, CDA, or API integration capabilities,
    however, they might not have the personnel to configure their instance to do that
    integration. It's not uncommon to find a nurse or clinic administrator who is
    also the EHR administrator. While they may be able to manage their provider's
    schedules or handle some claims, setting up an interface or API may be foreign
    to them. This can be a blocker for a project. \n\nDatica cannot directly assist
    with a backend EHR build. This is usually for one of these reasons:\n\n- The EHR
    vendor would require us to sign an agreement that had some kind of non-compete
    clause to it. \n- The EHR vendor will not grant us access to their systems. \n-
    We simply lack the expertise in 650 EHRs. \n\nAs such, if the organization needs
    assistance with an internal EHR build, it's out of the scope of our standard integration
    services. While we may be able to refer the organization to other consultants
    or vendors who can assist with this EHR build, additional scope and cost considerations
    would be included.\n\n### 3) Can you commit to getting work done within reasonable
    timelines?\n\nThe top KPI for a fast, successful installation is an agreed upon
    project plan with assigned task owners and due dates. At larger orgs, the only
    task owners are typically the EHR integrators (Datica) and organizational IT.
    However, in some integrations, there may be dependencies on vendors to perform
    some pieces of setup. This is particularly true if the org is not licensed for
    a given interface yet or if the EHR vendor hosts the organization's EHR instance.
    \n\nNot to sell you a horror story but, sometimes, these timelines can be brutal.
    While many projects go live within a month of kickoff, we've also seen projects
    span a year due to EHR vendors dragging their feet on either contracting or infrastructure
    deployments. Other than badgering effectively, unless your customer's organization
    can push their EHR vendor to move faster, it's hard to make the process any faster
    than it is. If your integrated product must be live by a certain point to reach
    contractual obligations to your customer, make sure your customer has the means
    to get that system live by that point. \n\n### 4) Who will validate clinical content
    and logic facilitated through integrations?\n\nYour application may want to segment
    patients based on certain clinical attributes sent in the payload of the HL7 or
    CDA message. For example, you may want your application to send an alert when
    a patient with diabetes is admitted to the hospital. The question, of course,
    is how do you define patients with diabetes? Will they be manually defined by
    clinicians or will you be trying to define them by diagnoses from the admission,
    in their problem list, or by other clinical attributes like High A1C or being
    prescribed insulin?\n\nWhile we can apply some logic to segment patients in our
    interface engine, we do not have clinical informaticists on hand to dictate or
    validate logic that we would create at your behest. The integration engine may
    not be the best place to have that application logic and you may consider those
    mappings and analysis to be IP of your company. You may decide that an organization
    purchasing your digital health product can validate your clinical content (Epic
    did this) or we are happy to refer you to informatics consultants who are qualified
    to assist you.\n\n## Evaluate the Integration's TCO\n\nWith these additional parameters,
    you may want to re-evaluate the [cost to integrate](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-integrations/)
    your digital health product. If you need to hire a niche EHR consultant to build
    an interface on the EHR itself and it costs $5k, can you pass that along to your
    customer or extract that value within your product? If not, you may debate the
    merits of deploying your product in a standalone fashion or adjusting the terms
    of your deal for your customer. If you're new to this, we can help. All [Datica
    Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) customers can engage with Datica for pre-sales
    support to define implementation strategies and to determine feasibility and ease
    of integration at a given site. \n"
