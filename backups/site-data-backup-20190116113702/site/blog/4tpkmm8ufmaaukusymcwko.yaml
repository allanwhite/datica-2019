:summary: 'Two months ago, six of the biggest tech companies in the world pledged
  support for FHIR to make healthcare data more interoperable and accessible. '
:blog_lead: 'Two months ago, six of the biggest technology companies in the world
  [came together at a White House press conference](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amazon-google-ibm-microsoft-oracle-and-salesforce-pledge-remove-interoperability-barriers)
  to pledge their commitment to making health data more interoperable and accessible.
  Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM made clear their commitment
  to easing access to healthcare data through a standards-based approach using [FHIR](https://datica.com/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
  and the work from projects like [Argonaut](http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

'
:post: "Interoperable and accessible health data would be wonderful. It was a stated
  goal that did not happen as a part of [Meaningful Use](https://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/introduction.html).
  But the industry, largely made up of care delivery organizations and payors, want
  easier access to data. Patients also expect better healthcare services enabled by
  data and technology and are often shocked they don’t yet exist in this digital world.
  And now, with this recent White House announcement, very large technology and solutions
  providers — many with a focus on the cloud — want to do more in healthcare and are
  pushing to make the flow of data easier. Healthcare data holds value to many interested
  and influential parties.\n\nHealthcare data in this context means clinical data
  — data stored in Electronic Health Records systems (EHRs) that is largely the result
  of the delivery of healthcare services (clinic visits, hospital stays, tests, etc).
  The EHRs hold this treasure trove of data and getting access to it is hard. There
  are some good reasons why access to clinical data is so difficult, mainly around
  privacy and integrity of the data. There are some not so good reasons why access
  to clinical data is hard, mainly to protect the EHR businesses from disruption.
  \n\nRegardless of the reasons, the pressure to provide access to EHR data is mounting
  and the standards for accessing this data are maturing. FHIR isn’t perfect but it’s
  good.\n\n## Why have so many groups taken up the cause of interoperable healthcare
  data? \n\nAccess to data is an essential enabler of the future of healthcare — one
  that will be largely data-driven. Clinical data, the data referenced above, is one
  very important piece of the puzzle of data-driven healthcare. There are other pieces
  to the data puzzle including genomics, images, and IoT. Data-driven healthcare is
  enabled by putting these four pieces of data together: \n\n1. Clinical\n2. Genomics\n3.
  Images\n4. IoT\n\n## What is data-driven healthcare? \n\nToday it is a lot of buzzwords
  like machine learning and precision medicine. It is a promise without much practical
  impact. That’s ok because those buzzwords represent real value once they are powered
  by the right data.\n\n### A move from population health to individualized medicine\n\nInstead
  of focusing on cohorts, or populations, of people for analysis and insight, data-driven
  healthcare enables interventions to be proactively targeted at individuals based
  on their profiles (a mix of data from those four sources above); data-driven healthcare
  moves us from population health to individualized medicine.\n\n### A move from risk
  pools to precision risk\n\nRisk can be precise as well, opening new models of behavior
  incentives and even insurance (and some potential downsides that we will have to
  solve for people with higher risks); data-driven healthcare moves us from risk pools
  to precision risk.\n\n### Shifts us from treating conditions to precision medicine\n\nTreatment
  regiments, instead of being condition-specific, can be tailored specifically to
  individuals based on their profiles; data-driven healthcare moves us from treating
  the condition to precision medicine.\n\n### Reduces unnecessary and redundant testing\n\nTesting
  can be done when it is actually needed, not redundantly and not for medical-legal
  reasons; data-driven healthcare reduces costs from unnecessary and redundant testing.\n\nThere
  are countless examples within each of those data-driven healthcare examples above
  and many more that aren’t in that list. But, we can only get to that promise if
  we have the data to enable it. That data-driven future holds incredible value to
  the companies that can enable it by providing access to the data and creating the
  platforms and tools to leverage that data. The cloud is going to be the underpinning
  of these data-driven healthcare platforms.\n\nThe writing is on the wall that data
  needs to flow more freely. Now, it’s a matter of time to see how this future is
  shaped and who shapes it. \n"

  :summary: '*The Healthcare Innovators Podcast* is proud to connect you with Grahame
    Grieve, Product Director of FHIR for HL7. Grahame hails from Melbourne, Australia
    and has come to be industry known as the "Father of FHIR." Before creating the
    Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, he spent years working with the HL7
    standards that assist in transferring clinical and administrative data between
    software applications. Today, we''ll learn a bit more about the background of
    FHIR and why healthcare subdomains are attracted to the FHIR standard. This is
    first in a three-part interview series around the FHIR standard and one that will
    leave you laughing as Grieve shares his favorite answer to what FHIR stands for. '
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Discover what potential healthcare requirement would force everyone to re-engineer their interfaces
    2. Learn the architectural advantage of FHIR versus other data exchange standards
    3. Understand Grahame's thoughts around open-source and its importance
    4. Discover the unrealized dream for FHIR and why Grahame wants to eventually come back to it
  :post: |-
    **On which subdomain is expressing the most Interest:** "The one that is getting the most focus and attraction right now is EHRs. We have projects in multiple countries, particularly in the USA, to provide open EHR access to data. That's primarily the highest profile work that we have going, but everybody's working relatively hard."

    **On the origin of naming FHIR:** "I'm very happy to say it wasn't my idea. Once it became clear that we had a working standard, I just called resources for help because I'm a boring kind of techie geek. I just called it what it was. Then the marketing committee at HL7 looked at it and said, 'if you want this to be a big deal, you've got to give it a funny name, so people can play with the name.' They banged it around and came up with the FHIR name."

    **On a favorite FHIR acronym twist:** "I've heard them all, but there are always new ones, as well as puns on the FHIR as part of the name. There's also a whole series of jokes around what the latest F-H-I-R actually stands for. My personal favorite is: 'Fixing HL7's International Reputation'."

    **On FHIR current pilots: ** "At the moment, we have prototypes and pilot projects in many countries in the world, in many domains. Some are high profile projects; some are under the radar projects. My focus is now on scaling up the community, because that's where our focus needs to be, because we are getting more and more implementations. In the next five years, FHIR will transition from being the next greatest thing to what everybody does, and becoming boring, in fact."

    **On the advantage of FHIR:** "One of the architectural advantages of FHIR versus other healthcare data exchange processes is that we leverage the Web."

    **On high-profile hacks: ** "Given the number of high profile identity hacks we've had this year, and those are only the reported ones, I think that we should stop assuming that there is any security around people's fundamental identification and the same should apply to their health. Instead of regarding that as necessary to secure, I think society will be forced to move to a world where everybody's information is open, and the social consequences aren't there."

    **On open-sourcing FHIR:**

    * "Health information should be free — free to move." " ...giving your information away increases its value."
    * "If you hold onto it and try to extract money out of its use, you're actually decreasing the value."
    * "I've become a strident believer in the value of open source for at least the area that we work in. There are a few other specifications providers who are moving away from any form of openness, getting more and more restrictive, insisting that we must pay them or they'll aggressively prosecute. I look at that and say, "I don't know why you would spend so much time decreasing your value."

    **On how much interoperability you need:** "I have a formula: How much interoperability do you need?  The answer is *n* times two, where 'n' is the amount you have."

  :summary: 'Now that healthcare is looking at "patients as consumers" and how to
    deliver and document quality care what changes in data requirements and strategy? '
  :blog_lead: Now that the healthcare system is starting to look at "patients as consumers"
    and consider how to deliver and document quality care in which patients enjoy
    the experience, what changes in terms of data requirements and strategy? The short
    answer is lots of things, most notably more data elements on patients collected
    on a continuous basis.
  :post: "EHRs were built to document delivered care and they do a good job of that.
    There have been a lot of critiques of the UX and design of EHRs but documenting
    care for billing in today's healthcare system is extremely cumbersome. EHRs are
    the main tool, and do it well. Today, documented care is based on episodic care—ambulatory
    appointments, notes from acute stays, labs, etc. EHRs contain terabytes of episodic
    data plus the corresponding metadata about the episodes like charges, payments,
    schedules, and more. Thousands of tables worth of data in fact, most of which
    is [not clinically relevant][3].\n\nEHR documentation becomes relevant in volume-based
    systems where payment stems from patient visits, but becomes problematic with
    the shift to quality and outcome-based payment models. It certainly doesn't have
    anything to do with what is best for the patient since, by design, EHRs were built
    and are optimized to document and bill for the visit and not to directly take
    into account the outcome, or experience, or patient financial impact.\n\n![epic-visual](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1ksaEBL5Xgc0kGQQSaMUig/a38bfc9c9abfab18bc68ea8ac68cc5c1/epic-visual.png)\n\nI
    find this image from Epic's [website][5] ironic. The notion of the patient at
    the heart, while accurate in the sense of the patient being at the center of the
    technology and different systems that Epic sells, is fundamentally misaligned
    with the patient, heart or otherwise. It's not the fault of Epic. They solved
    a major industry problem by addressing the government-incentivized Meaningful
    Use era. But nothing about the EHR is about the patient or hearts of patients.\n\nNow
    that the healthcare system is starting to look at \"patients as consumers\" and
    consider how to deliver and document quality care in which patients enjoy the
    experience, what changes in terms of data requirements and strategy? The short
    answer is lots of things, most notably more data elements on patients collected
    on a continuous basis. \n\n1. **Patients need access to EHR data.** Health systems
    have to provide patients access to their own data. This isn't a major hurdle to
    overcome and standards like Blue Button Plus and CCD exist and meet this requirement.
    Access to data is really just an enabler of what should be tools that help patients
    use their own data to inform their decisions. Access to data is a precursor to
    the real ROI-driving tools.\n2. **Health systems need to collect data from patients.**
    Health systems, not the EHRs, need to be able to collect data from patients. This
    can be data on symptoms or adherence or information about patient satisfaction
    with health services rendered. Patient-sourced data is emerging as a key part
    of several new payment programs and is referred to broadly as patient reported
    outcomes (PRO).\n3. **Health systems need data from digital health partners.**
    For the first time at scale, payment for healthcare delivery is not about delivery
    and is about the patient. To optimize care around the patient, delivery organizations
    need to partner with digital health vendors that engage and interact with patients,
    and leverage data from those partners to make informed and proactive decisions
    about care.\n4. **Health systems need data from health system \"partners\".**
    As health systems assume risk for episodes (30-90 day bundles are good immediate
    term examples) that span more than in person encounters, they need to be able
    to track patients outside of their own facilities. To accomplish this, health
    systems will need to have near real time access to data, or at the very least
    alerting, from other entities like pharmacies (for primary and secondary adherence),
    skilled nursing facilities, and other delivery organizations and community anchors
    where patients may present during certain periods of time in which systems have
    assumed the accountability for care for patients.\n5. **Health systems need activity
    data.** This is a specific form of PRO and \"partner\" data. Since writing my
    post 3 years ago we've seen the growth of companies like [Validic][6] to make
    it easier to collect activity and sensor data from a multitude of 3rd party apps
    and sensors. We're really just scratching the surface here. The biggest challenge
    is not the technology but the integration of the data into clinical workflow.\n6.
    **Health systems need socioeconomic data.** There are lots of [studies][7] that
    have shown the correlation between socioeconomic data and health costs and outcomes.
    This is another source of data that needs to matched to patients to inform decisions
    by healthcare organizations.\n7. **Health systems need genetics data.** Genetics
    is the path to personalized medicine, though this is further off than the more
    immediate initiatives around quality and value-based care.\n8. **Health systems
    need to know patient preferences.** Healthcare is increasingly about the experience
    of patients. In order to delivery a positive experience, healthcare organizations
    need to understand the preferences of patients and need to be able to market to
    them. The aim of marketing in this context, mainly around quality care, is not
    to sell products but to influence decisions related to health and wellness.\n\nIf
    you look at the change that is required in terms of data strategy for healthcare
    delivery, you can see it is paradigm shift from today. This entirely new data
    strategy is predicated on gathering and leveraging big data on patients. Big Data
    in this context means the maximum number of dimensions, or data elements, on a
    patient, not 4,000-6,000 tables of EHR data in which only about 10% are relevant
    for clinical care and outcomes. This paradigm shift is driven with patients at
    the heart and quality outcomes as the goal.\n\nThose who believe this is healthcare's
    5-10-year trajectory then ask the question \"How do you start to work towards
    this strategy?\" The industry currently thinks EHRs will be the hub of data. I
    understand why this is the case as health systems, and the federal government,
    have spent 100s of billions of dollars to implement EHRs and convince clinicians
    to adopt them in a meaningful way. The problem with this thinking is that it requires
    health systems to essentially bolt on a new, and extremely complex, data strategy,
    along with predictive analytics, to EHR - products built for an entirely different
    purpose and written with underlying technologies that were developed more than
    40 years ago. This, to me, seems short sighted and reactive to what are now sunk
    costs for EHRs.\n\nEpisodes of care aren't going away with bundled payments and
    accountable care, and neither should EHRs. They should continue to do the myriad
    of things they do today. The massive investment that has been made in EHRs, and
    the set of data EHRs were built to collect and store, should be leveraged as a
    part of this new quality care data strategy. We have a new, widely-hyped standard
    called FHIR that can feed clinically relevant EHR data from encounters so why
    not use it to do just that. It is being pushed by the major EHR companies as a
    way to feed EHR data to different 3rd party applications but could work equally
    well to feed EHR data into a new digital health hub.\n\nWhy are we shoehorning
    everything into an already clunky system purpose built for a different paradigm
    of care? [Sunk costs][8] aren't a good reason. EHRs do EHR, why would you buy
    it to do pop health or data warehousing or predictive analytics? They aren't the
    same things. \n\n[1]: http://histalkmobile.com/big-data-on-patients/\n[2]: http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/how-we-help-clients/understanding-the-consumer\n[3]:

  :summary: 'For the first time in twenty years, hospitals, vendors, and even payers
    and life sciences providers agree on something: FHIR is the way forward.'
  :blog_lead: The hype about [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)
    has spread like, well, wildfire. The healthcare industry is often targeted by
    new, sexy technologies that sound great on the surface but often have few practical
    implementations. FHIR is NOT one of those technologies. In fact, FHIR has many
    practical use cases and benefits. More importantly, for the first time in twenty
    years, healthcare organizations, vendors, and even payers and life sciences providers
    agree this is the path forward for modern integration. This prevalent support
    is speeding FHIR’s adoption and feedback loop on improvement. Datica’s newest
    guide, [What Health Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    takes a candid look at the factors fueling open-data transformation at hospitals
    and health systems. Here are a few highlights from the guide.
  :post: "\n## EHR’s aren’t cutting it. \n\nHospitals, in particular, are looking
    for technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have
    accomplished what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order
    to improve accessibility of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally
    stored and can be viewed across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR
    implementations laid the information technology groundwork that would become the
    fabric of a healthcare transformation movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis
    Good wrote in a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
    the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
    \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
    with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
    And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
    solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do
    not, reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new
    solutions than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking
    this organizational transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The
    industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason that being able to
    access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation tools to
    innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single
    implementation of the standard [in a centralized data hub](https://datica.com/managed-integration/)
    is the most efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients
    expect transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once
    were. They expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience
    because of their experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that
    patients are consumers in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
    of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare –
    has changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
    did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a
    mortgage. Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes,
    and clear, transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is
    what people have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n##
    Government mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are
    going to be required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.
    \ We’ve seen references to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica.com/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
    [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica.com/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
    Century Cures legislation](https://datica.com/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
    The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
    in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
    providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
    and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
    for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
    on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
    and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health
    Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables
    in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\n"

  :summary: 'Mark Olschesky shares what he learned, saw, and enjoyed at the 2nd annual
    HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. Hint: FHIR is fast becoming a reality.'
  :blog_lead: I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at
    the 2nd [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable](http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/roundtable/2017/03/).
    This topped my must-attend 2017 events after I attended the first event last fall
    in Boston. Here's what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.
  :post: "## A Recap of the HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable\n\n### Datica's presentation\nI
    presented a demonstration of Datica, highlighting how vendors and innovation groups
    can use [Compliant Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) to build applications
    that aggregate hospital registration and scheduling feeds along with vitals and
    results from multiple organizations. They can then build the longitudinal patient
    records in an easy to query method. Of course, the underlying data storage format
    and query mechanisms are those provided by FHIR. It's an effective catalyst for
    companies building a new product that relies on data integration, especially from
    disparate sources. If you need to facilitate faster application development for
    you or your team, let us know and we’ll schedule a demo.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/MpnXJGu24MqkQo88WOWMu/f737b76a63cf82ad05e296baaa631752/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo.jpg)\n
    \n### More live demos\nWhile the last FHIR Applications Roundtable featured many
    \"conceptual\" demonstrations of applications, during this second roundtable we
    saw more applications directly embedded into EHRs; presenters demonstrated their
    apps within the Cerner and Epic EHRs. After this year’s presentations, I can say
    with even more certainty that FHIR is for real.\n \n### Real-life use cases for
    PHRs and patient-initiated interoperability\nPersonal Health Records (PHRs) have
    existed for years, but often lacked true utility due to their inability to integrate
    directly with EHRs and their associated patient portals. As such, most PHRs operated
    via manual patient entry of their data into the PHR software. This had changed.
    Multiple demos showed how PHRs could use SMART on FHIR to access data from multiple
    EHRs and patient portals, all with permissions and scope set by the patient. Live
    demos highlighted this functionality, including one given by Michele Mottini from
    CareEvolution showing access of data from Cedars-Sinai My CS-Link (powered by
    Epic's MyChart). As someone who operates primarily on the B2B side of interoperability
    but yearned for real solutions around patient-initiated interoperability, seeing
    that patients will have the ability to aggregate data from multiple portals and
    hospitals soon is exciting. A hat tip to Epic and Cerner for making this happen.\n
    \n### Need for API management\nA few vendors provided presentations on how access
    controls could be layered on top of FHIR for more pragmatic management of FHIR
    resources. It seems like [EMR vendors are remaining hands-off](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    in this space, leading other vendors to rush in to fill the gap in API management
    (including Datica!).\n \n### People from all sides of the healthcare technology
    spectrum\nThe ability to talk to employees from startups, publicly-traded companies,
    hospitals and payers, life sciences and pharma all in the same place is amazing
    at the Apps Roundtable. Once again, [people are investing time and resources in
    FHIR](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/). A data standard is only
    as good as its utility and more and more companies are pledging to utilize it.
    As someone who wants to see interoperability improved through pragmatic standards-based
    integration, this provides hope that we'll get there.\n\n### Duke is lovely\nAfter
    things wrapped up on Wednesday, I meandered around the Medical School. Taking
    a short walk from the hospital towards the Duke Chapel and Gardens on a nice sunny
    day provided a peaceful environment only steps from the hospital.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/32c1t5oUPSUSScGW0UM2gi/175e508b0ac48fb5a8492063b591199b/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior.jpg)\n\nDatica
    is a proud member of the [HL7 organization](http://www.hl7.org/). Basing our integration
    and data management approaches around standards like FHIR gives our customers
    the best chance at being future-proof vs. proprietary data formats built by other
    vendors. These HL7 events gives us a first-hand look at what others are working
    on and how we can help make that happen with Datica Compliant Cloud.\n\n*Get the

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
