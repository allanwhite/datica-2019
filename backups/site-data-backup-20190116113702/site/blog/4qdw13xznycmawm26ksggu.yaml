  :summary: This was Datica's first time attending AWS Re:invent along with 32,000
    attendees ranging from engineers to CIOs and a broad range of industries.
  :blog_lead: This is the first time that we at Datica are attending AWS Re:invent.
    We always knew that the event was large but we're surprised to see and hear that
    the event has grown substantially since last year. AWS re:invent expects to have
    about 32,000 attendees this year with attendee profiles ranging from engineers
    to CIOs and a broad range of industries.
  :post: |-
    This is a recap of observations during the first half of the conference. We'll publish another recap at the end of the conference.

    From what we understand this is the first year that there was a specific track and presentations focused around healthcare and life sciences with some big names presenting. This track was on Monday before the formal kickoff on Tuesday when the keynotes begin to happen. Presenters included the following:

    * **Cambia**: who spoke on large scale machine learning and data science / big data
    * **Cerner**: who spoke about having an on-demand DR strategy for their HealtheIntent platform
    * **Merck**: who spoke about remaining in continuous compliance with life sciences and other regulatory standard
    * **UCSC** Genomics Institute: who spoke about large scale cancer genomic data analysis
    * **Claritas Genomics**: who participated in a panel with Motorola and Coursera discussing how to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in education (FERPA), healthcare (HIPAA) and legal (CJIS).

    These tracks were extremely popular with long lines. The overflow lines were very long as well and wound around entire hallways.

    As you can gather from the talk titles themselves, a lot of the focus was on regulatory requirements and big data. We saw compliance emerge as potentially the most important topic amongst healthcare.

    Healthcare, being more conservative than most industries, is embarking down this cloud journey with hybrid cloud deployments being the initial strategy. Organizations want to move to the cloud, but not immediately. They are looking for more of a transition.

    The move to the cloud is being looked at as an opportunity because various reasons such as:

    * **Cost of Elasticity**: as mentioned earlier, a lot of the initial efforts seem to be focused around big data and analytics. The numbers thrown out during those sessions were invariably in the multiple petabytes range. At that scale, the cloud is an ideal option with immediate scale available as needed.
    * **Clean slate**: While some organizations have been in the cloud for a little while, the move to the cloud gives these organizations a chance to re-do and re-architect their solutions. Such as making them more service oriented, more micro services etc.
    * **Repeatability and reusability**: While there is a heavy initial focus on the US, the organizations are also global in scope. With the added regulations around data sovereignty that are being imposed by governments, any IT strategy must be globally scalable. The cloud with multiple points of presence globally allows for addressing this need in a much more cost effective and faster manner.
    * **Building DevOps competency**: This is increasingly important. Companies are realizing that scaling locally or globally requires automation. Especially because of repeatability as that is a core requirement for regulatory purposes. Managing separate global deployments becomes cost effective only if they're not snowflakes.
    * **Availability of toolsets**: With a plethora of services such as EMR (elastic map reduce) which includes support for Hadoop, Spark etc., prebuilt AMIs to support analytics such as Tableau, Qlik and more, RDS and more, initial setup and learning curves are much shortened.
    * **Simplified logging and audit trails**: A lot of the regulatory requirements come down to detailed audit trails and data extraction from logs. The cloud provides these raw data spouts quickly. Some effort is required, of course, to connect, parse and present this raw data in a usable format.

    While all that is great, there still are some challenges.

    1. ** Volume of data**: There is no simple answer here especially because of the large volumes of data mentioned earlier. Things like Snowball help get the initial load done but ongoing challenges like DR (disaster recovery) remain a challenge. Especially if that requires a 2x investment in infra. Cerner has approached this through an on-demand DR strategy where the raw data is replicated always but the infra needed to run analytics etc is spun up whenever needed and data reprocessed. This has the challenge of a full 100% recovery taking up to 12 hours but is still an impressive effort.
    2. **Networking and encryption in transit**: Networking is still a bit esoteric and challenging especially in the compliance world combined with enterprisey components. Combined these two require full encryption in-transit using rotating TLS keys, 2FA (two factor authentication), ADFS (Active Directory Federation Service) and IAM (AWS' Identity and Access Management) integrations and ongoing management of ACLs. Additional requirements like bastion servers gating access and separate VPCs for "management" and compute / data are also recommended as best practice.

    ## Summary

    It looks like the move to the cloud is accelerating in healthcare and life sciences. Big data and analytics seem to be at the vanguard of this effort. Disaster recovery on demand also seems to be of value. Hybrid strategies leveraging existing investment and the cloud as an extension of that seems to be the first step.

  :summary: We recap the second half of the AWS Re:Invent conference with a look at
    how some of the announcements could be applicable to the healthcare domain.
  :blog_lead: "## A recap of the AWS re:Invent keynotes\n    \nWe're returning from
    three and a half days at the re:invent conference. It was an extraordinary event
    both in terms of the number of people attending but also in terms of the calibre
    and diversity of the attendees. I had some conversations where people reminisced
    about how re:invent has come to be **the** IT conference and has taken over the
    mantle from VMWorld. It also helps that the brands making presentations and sharing
    their knowledge are acknowledged leaders in their industry _viz_ Netflix (entertainment),
    Merck (life sciences), FINRA (finance), Twilio (messaging), Mapbox (mapping),
    enterprise IT (VMWare and Workday), McDonald's (fast food) and more. Every presentation
    in the keynote has slides filled with logos of major brands in every industry
    you can imagine. Each of the keynotes—the first by CEO Andy Jassy and the second
    by CTO Werner Vogels—were about two and a half hours long. Each was filled with
    product announcements and interspersed with customer presentations, all of which
    were illuminating and funny at times as well. The Snowmobile announcement, for
    one, was sheer showmanship (it was driven onto stage) and remains memorable for
    every attendee. It was also parked right next to our booth in the exhibit hall
    and had a constant stream of people coming by to take selfies and pose with it."
  :post: "![IMG 4343](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1enTmTaXO0e66UYSaIOiCI/a92c59be15c6ba00f63e1dd7d9492fb7/IMG_4343.jpg)\n\nWhile
    both keynotes were interesting from a technology perspective, I felt that it would
    be worthwhile to condense it down and explore how some of these announcements
    could be applicable to the healthcare domain.\n\n## Possible healthcare impact
    from major product announcements made and \n\n### EC2 instance sizes\n\n[EC2 instances][3]
    that are bigger, smaller and programmable were announced, to satisfy the least
    and the most compute / memory / storage hungry software. Some of these were geared
    to keep AWS way ahead of it's competitors and others such as [LightSail][4] (the
    preconfigured virtual private server - VPS) seemed to be directly targeted at
    niches serviced by companies like Digital Ocean. \n\nThis is important for healthcare
    and life sciences. As I wrote about [before][5], one of the primary use cases
    that the healthcare industry is focused on is big data analytics, which necessarily
    implies large scale data analysis which in turn requires pretty large scale machines.
    Given that elasticity is also possible with these machines, things such as genomic
    analysis and outcomes analysis is likely to benefit substantially. At the other
    end of the spectrum, smaller instances will allow innovation and other groups
    to dip their toes into the cloud or try out ideas quickly and cheaply.\n\n###
    AI and ML as an API\n\n[Rekognition][6] (image analysis and detection), [Polly][7]
    (text to voice with intelligence) and [Lex][8] (voice based AI and interaction),
    all accessible via an API were announced. Machine Learning (ML) via an API and
    UI was announced earlier with these new products now being able to be used in
    concert. While some believe that Google has a lead in the AI space given it's
    history and access to vast troves of data, AWS seems to be focusing it's efforts
    on enabling specific use cases that customers might have in specific domains and
    offering up the technology it uses internally in products such as Alexa / Echo.
    All of this seems to be in response to Google's announcements earlier about the
    availability of its solutions, it does seem that in conjunction with the data
    movement and compute solutions, AWS might be in a position to catch up with Google
    in this regard. It does seem like this is an attempt to also make the technology
    more ubiquitous and thus the de-facto. I wouldn't be surprised to see ML and AI
    models developed by customers made available to others on the AWS marketplace
    in a little while. \n\nAI and ML is, of course, extremely applicable to healthcare.
    Reams of data is available within EHRs, PACS, PBM systems, pharmacies and claims
    management systems. However, analyzing all this data requires the right set of
    people. Both from a deployment and ongoing system management perspective but also,
    even more importantly, from the data science perspective. Other industries are
    also jumping into the data fray which makes it very challenging to staff up on
    both the devOps as well as the data science roles. The above mentioned solution
    is an attempt by AWS to try and simplify access to this somewhat esoteric of fields.
    I would predict academic hospitals with its set of medical informaticists, medical
    students and researchers, seeing immediate use for this capability. Specifically
    Rekognition and the ML API...\n\nOn the consumer side too, we can expect to see
    Lex (with voice based commands to summon the nurse, control the temperature, raise
    and lower the bed, capturing patient feedback and many more) being put to use
    in various ways in hospitals and Polly on the web or inside clinical applications.
    The possibilities are quite staggering.\n\n### Embedded IoT software aka Greengrass\n\nAs
    a preloaded piece of software onto IoT chips and with pre-built security, AWS
    Lambda links, local storage and orchestration amongst devices, [Greengrass][9]
    was a major announcement that is very timely. Especially given the recent DDoS
    attacks initiated via IoT devices and also that the IoT trend is not slowing down
    anytime soon. \n\nDevices already exist within health systems and have been [recognized][10]
    to be very insecure. The capabilities described can make Greengrass the foundation
    for another generation of more intelligent and secure healthcare IoT devices.\n\n###
    VMWare Cloud on AWS\n\nThis had to have been one of the most significant [announcements][11]
    re enterprise IT. VMWare cloud (vMotion), vSphere (compute), NSX (networking)
    and vSAN (storage) are all deployed on bare metal machines on AWS. Enterprise
    IT teams used to working in the VMWare world can now move seamlessly from one
    to the other. This is likely to speed up adoption of the AWS cloud significantly.
    There was no mention of exclusivity from VMWare so we can expect to see similar
    announcements coming soon from Azure and Google.\n\nHealthcare and life sciences
    are still in the early stages of the move to the cloud but this VMWare cloud on
    AWS could be just the thing that could act as the catalyst to accelerate that
    movement. However, the issues around compliance (HIPAA, HITRUST and GxP) remain
    open and need to be addressed. We do see this as an area of opportunity for us.\n\n###
    Cloud-first data management tools\n\n[Step Functions][12] (workflow management),
    [Glue][13] (ETL), [Athena][14] (S3 querying) were all geared towards enabling
    and simplifying data movement and massaging needed to enable analytics and machine
    learning capabilities. With expanding capabilities, it does seem that AWS could
    be considered competitive to companies such as Mulesoft. \n\nThis is pretty significant
    in that this is billed only a use basis, which implies that you no longer have
    to buy expensive upfront licenses but only as needed. This can have an immediate
    impact for healthcare startups as well as for the innovation groups in healthcare
    institutions.\n\n### Automatic DDoS protection\n\n[Shield][15] was a great announcement
    which essentially provides **all** AWS customers with core DDoS protection (volumetric
    and TCP) automatically and for no extra charge. Advanced versions are also available
    of course at a higher price. But this free offering is a great first step to address
    the concerns that some customers have raised with us as well. While it makes marketing
    sense, it also makes sound business sense to AWS because DDoS attacks on any of
    their customer accounts will have a cascading impact on other customer's workloads
    and secondly, there are bound to be issues with the final bill post attacks. \n\nThis
    further removes the security concerns felt by CIOs and CISOs in health systems
    and plans especially given that basic protection is automatically put into place
    and leverages the cumulative man-years of knowledge that AWS has in protecting
    it's own and it's customer's infrastructure.\n\n### Easier data transfer to the
    cloud\n\nI wrote about the challenge that a lot of the customer's continue to
    face in moving data to the cloud from their datacenters in the [previous post][5].
    This has been addressed by using much larger capacity [Snowballs][16] with some
    enhancements and compute ability and for very large data transfers measured in
    exabytes, a tractor trailer sized device, called the [Snowmobile][17].\n\n## Summary\n\nTwo
    key points.\n\n1. With a revenue run rate of $15 Billion—and a projected growth
    rate of 55% YoY that as a business size dwarfs the next 14 competitors put together—the
    AWS business is enormous.\n\n2. The move to the cloud, while not in it's infancy,
    is only just in it's pre-teen years.\n\nWe can expect to see AWS as the market
    leader and the de-facto choice of many of the CIOs in healthcare. Given Amazon's
    history of expanding into related spaces, it is not surprising to see it expand
    into domains led by companies by New Relic, Digital Ocean and Mulesoft. While
    AWS' offerings might not be as full featured as the established, we can safely
    predict that in a year or less, they are likely to be at feature parity which
    should be a source of concern for those companies.\n\nThe healthcare industry
    can leverage a lot of these new capabilities. We expect to see immediate uptake
    on the larger machine sizes for big data and analytics, short term uptake on the
    ML and AI toolsets especially in academic healthcare and medium to long term adoption
    of the Greengrass toolkit for innovative device development and use. \n\nIt will
    be interesting to see how Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM SoftLayer, and others do
    to counter next year.\n\n[3]: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\n[4]:

  :summary: Today we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined
    with Open-Source Connectors for the Datica Platform.
  :blog_lead: Today we are launching one-click installations of [Mirth Connect](https://www.mirth.com/)
    combined with Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help
    solve the problem of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution
    is a testament to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration
    in the best way possible.
  :post: "> Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. We aim to empower the developer community to solve
    the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant,
    and secure.\n\nThe launch is based on consistent feedback that customers need
    more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better pricing
    at scale, and future-proofing for things like [FHIR](/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    and the Epic App Orchard and Cerner Code.\n\nDatica has been doing healthcare
    integration since October 2014, going through a [few iterations in pricing and
    packaging](/blog/announcing-self-service-and-free-trials/). Regardless of the
    iteration, our pragmatic, partnership approach remained consistent and accomplished
    a lot. In three years we built a team of experts to deliver on integrations and
    delivered over 150 live integrations into healthcare organizations, with many
    more in process. Historically it was a SaaS-based pricing model where customers
    paid a fixed fee per month per interface, per site or even an annual license to
    purchase site-based delivery. We did integration work in every major vertical:
    vendors, life sciences, healthcare organizations, and payers.\n\nTimes have changed
    since 2014 in the integration world. The cloud has gone from a taboo term in digital
    health to the default place to build 99% of new healthcare applications. FHIR
    has gone from a glimmer in [Grahame Grieve's](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1/)
    eye into an API platform that will soon be made available from most of the big
    EHRs. A new wave of digital health developers believe in openness first, even
    at hospitals as they look to commercialize IP in a digital format. There was no
    way to predict this would happen so fast (at least in healthcare, three years
    seems fast) but we are here now.\n\nOver the last three years, we learned the
    best way to help our customers was to teach them this point: there is no silver
    bullet to integration **but it is a problem you can solve with the right tools**.
    \n\nThat's why we are releasing the ability to deploy Mirth Connect with \"one-click\"
    into your [Datica environment](/platform/). You gain the expertise we've built
    on running reliable and available integration capabilities in one-click, deployed
    directly into your compliant environment on the Datica platform. Mirth, which
    is an open-source platform itself, is a great tool for software developers to
    use for integration. This is why we've written up documentation based on the hundreds
    of integrations that we've done which can teach you quickly how to [get started
    on using Mirth](https://datica.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001535023-Mirth-Getting-Started).\n\n##
    Open-Source Mirth Connectors\n\nWe also [open-sourced our code](https://github.com/daticahealth/Mirth-Transforms)
    for transforming data from HL7 to JSON. This is a major evolution for digital
    health teams. We do not believe in locking customers into proprietary APIs, so
    we have published everything we've learned at the transformation layer, with many
    more scripts to come. It's all in an effort to help you gain more transparency
    and confidence with [EHR integration](/discover/ehr-integrations/).\n\nThese connectors
    are a series of libraries that can be plugged into your Mirth Connect environment
    which immediately enable HL7 feeds for consumption by a restful API. We will be
    continuing to open-source content as we create it, including transformers to other
    data types like those for [Open mHealth](http://www.openmhealth.org/) and [Office
    365 Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/actionable-messages-via-connectors).
    The only major limitations behind what we aim to open-source will be transforms
    which are based on vendor-specific connections or data models which we can't expose
    due to legal reasons (e.g. Epic Interconnect XML data models).\n\n## Integration
    Environment Details\n\nTake note: the integration environment is much more than
    just Mirth. Each environment has a bundle of tools important to successful integration:\n\n*
    Highly Available (HA) configuration of Mirth instances. HA operations of Mirth
    are not trivial. We make it easy, instantly.\n* HA configuration of Postgres.
    A supplemental database is important for initial message ingestion, and must support
    a similar HA nature for continuous connection.\n* Load balancers.\n* Network monitoring
    and usage alerts. Understanding the traffic usage is important for audit purposes.
    Additional alerting is important for ongoing management of a connection.\n* VPN
    Management. Remember, you do not integrate with Epic, you integrate with a specific
    site's version of Epic. Therefore you'll need a VPN for every integration you
    plan to make. Our VPN tooling makes it easy, combined with our expertise in how
    to ensure they stay connected 24/7.\n\nThe integration environment is available
    in both the [Standard and Professional plans](/pricing). The environment is not
    available for free trials (yet), but will be soon. Along with this update, we
    have now made VPN management available in the Standard plan as well, so people
    can get started with EHR integration for as low as $1,150/mo.\n\nWe're often asked
    how much throughput a typical environment can handle. The answer is _a lot_. A
    single environment with no modifications can handle as many as fifty site integrations.
    If customers need to scale throughput, they simply scale RAM. If you have any
    additional questions, [please reach out](/services/#cta). We're happy to chat.\n\n##
    Pricing Updates\n\nOne thing you may notice is that we do not bundle the integration
    environment with professional services under the name of \"Managed Integration\"
    anymore.\n\nOur customers that have greater challenges or unique needs can now
    purchase both separately since services are now optional.\n\nThis means digital
    health teams can get all the integration tooling they need — along with HITRUST
    CSF Certified, HIPAA compliant, secure infrastructure housed under one [Business
    Associate Agreement](/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
    — for as little as $1,150/mo.\n\nThe other exciting news about Datica's pricing
    is that this scales much better for you. It's pricing that is truly aligned with
    your success.\n\n## The Future of Integration Is Open\n\nThis is a shift in how
    we offer integration because it better aligns with the needs of digital health
    companies. You want open standards, you want ease of use, you want compliance
    and security, but most importantly, you want successful EHR integrations. This
    new option gives that to you with a single click.\n\nHealthcare developers can
    get started on new projects faster, and benefit from three years of learning.
    We aim to empower the developer community to solve the problem of integration
    themselves with tools that are open, reliable, compliant, and secure.\n\nFor moments
    where projects seem too difficult, [our integration services team](/services)
    will be ready to jump in and help you with that lift. We see a world in which
    all of our customers can eventually own their own integrations and we want to
    provide the easiest path for customers to be able to manage that themselves. [Reach
    out](/services/#cta) if you have any questions, we'd love to help you out.\n"

'
  :blog_lead: |-
    HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

    AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
  :post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
    healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time
    again.\n\nInnovative health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying
    to adopt AWS:\n\n1. **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push
    projects to internally owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving
    to the cloud, those initiatives can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the
    DevOps and cloud engineering resources needed outside of their control.\n\n2.
    **Internal Compliance does not approve of the low levels of liability taken on
    by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
    roughly 1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical
    level and firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's
    responsibility. Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned
    with Internal Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector.
    While AWS themselves have some of the best infrastructure security measures in
    the world, the operating system level is still the responsibility now of the organization
    to secure. That's a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem
    requiring hard-to-find resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll
    combined, most healthcare enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas,
    Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur,
    articulated this exact pain while giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe

    Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST
    has been a godsend.\n\nFor three years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified
    on top of AWS. Our Platform absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the
    cloud, which extends AWS's excellent coverage for compliance **of** the cloud.
    \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
    enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
    internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
    projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
    the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
    \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
    Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and
    compliance in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe
    result is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are
    making a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n##

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica
    workflow diagram AWS](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3mxh8k3ZGwiUQce862ga2Q/1e86d891b61168f5f20c0814c8e74da0/Datica_workflow_diagram_AWS_2x.png)](https://assets.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4Qokvx5TskWwCWwGQk0wM/8304e9c351e19a1eb9eb8790f6d269a3/Datica_workflow_diagram.pdf)\n\nIf
    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
    [BAA from Datica](https://policy.datica.com/#23.-datica-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-(\"baa\")).
    \n\nAligning Business Associate Agreements amongst all technology partners is
    a full-time job. You sign one BAA with Datica to cover the entirety of compliance
    in the cloud, including AWS HIPAA compliance."
