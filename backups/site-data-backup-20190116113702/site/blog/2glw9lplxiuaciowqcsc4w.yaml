:summary: There are many key security and privacy considerations for buyers to consider
  when exploring an M & A opportunity. Christine Sublett spells it out.
:blog_lead: "Technical and financial due diligence have long been a part of the review
  performed by an acquiring company prior to a merger or acquisition (M & A). Cyber
  security has finally become an important business concern, and this requires information
  security to also be addressed with as much importance. Without appropriate security
  due diligence, the acquiring company runs the risk of introducing significant business
  and technology risk into their organization. \n"
:post: "\nOne doesn’t have to look too hard to see an example where this did not occur;
  [the Verizon acquisition of Yahoo](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html)
  and the TripAdvisor acquisition of Viator are two recent examples (2016 and 2014),
  with [Viator suffering their breach only weeks after the acquisition](https://thehackernews.com/2014/09/tripadvisors-viator-hit-by-massive-14_24.html).
  And at the time of the Yahoo breach, Verizon used the opportunity [to express some
  doubt about the acquisition and to ask for more favorable terms](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-m-a-verizon-idUSKBN14P215).
  \ \n\nIt’s important to develop an M & A strategy, and data security deserves consideration
  in this process. Vendors that deliver services to healthcare organizations need
  to comply with a myriad of local, state, federal, and international privacy and
  security regulatory requirements. At the federal level there are sector-specific
  laws such as HIPAA. In addition, many states including California and Massachusetts
  have data security regulations that require organizations to develop, implement,
  and maintain reasonable information security programs. There are many key security
  and privacy considerations for buyers to consider when exploring an M & A opportunity.
  These include the following.\n\n## Data Security safeguards, policies and procedures\n\nAre
  the policies adequate to comply with applicable regulatory environments? Understanding
  and evaluating a company’s risk profile requires thoughtful analysis of the policies
  and practices regarding data collection, use, disclosure, transmission, storage
  and destruction. Does the company have a comprehensive information security program
  including appropriate policies and procedures? How does the company educate and
  train workforce members and third-party vendors with access to data? Do they have
  an appropriate data protection framework that classifies information assets? Do
  they have appropriate access control policies and procedures to reduce the risk
  of inappropriate access to information assets? What is their data retention policy?
  Do they have a vendor management program in place? Do they have appropriate contractual
  protections in place with their vendors? Do they have someone focused on information
  security such as a Chief Information Security Officer(CISO)? \n\n## Security controls
  \n\nAre the controls implemented by the company adequate and appropriate for the
  industry in which they do business? While HIPAA and/or HITRUST have numerous physical,
  administrative and technical control requirements, how a company addresses and implements
  these controls differ across organizations. Have they conducted any third-party
  audits or maintain [certifications such as HITRUST](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/)
  or a SOC 2? Do they have disaster recovery and business continuity plans? Do they
  perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests? Do they perform security
  testing on their mobile app? Do they have an incident response plan, and do they
  test it regularly? Have they experienced any data breaches or security incidents?
  Do they perform appropriate background and security checks on new workforce members?
  Do they have policies and guidance on how data and systems are physically secured?
  Do they have appropriate solutions in place to know if they are experiencing an
  attack? Do they maintain appropriate endpoint controls to prevent compromise?\n\nIn
  addition, do they maintain a current data map or inventory? It’s critical to understand
  where data is stored, who can access it, and whether it is secured appropriately
  as part of an overall [information governance program](https://datica.com/blog/information-governance-survey-shows-benefits-in-compliance/).
  \n\nWhile security due diligence may show gaps in security posture, it doesn’t mean
  that the deal will fall through; rather, it will mean that the acquiring company
  knows what they are getting and then are able to appropriately price the deal taking
  into account both value of the acquisition, and cost to remediate security deficiencies.\n\n*Datica

  :summary: Though different in who they apply to and how you prove compliance, HIPAA
    and GDPR are both about having security as a core tenet of operations.
  :blog_lead: At the AWS re:Invent conference earlier this month, GDPR was a major
    area of interest from attendees though AWS has little content coverage for GDPR.
    GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, is the acronym for
    the much anticipated new EU security and privacy framework that goes into effect
    in May of 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion to EU member states but, as a general
    rule, and the reason it is getting so much attention, is that it applies across
    all EU Member States. The purpose of this post is to introduce those familiar
    with healthcare privacy and security in the United States, namely those concerned
    with HIPAA, to GDPR. This post doesn’t get into technical requirements, or even
    security requirements more generally, but instead focuses on the broader principles
    and privacy guidelines for health data under GDPR.
  :post: "\nThe process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks,
    both for us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our
    changes through the updates to our [open source policies and procedures](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/);
    our policies define the operational and technical controls we use. We started
    with HIPAA and quickly expanded to leverage [HITRUST](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-csf-certification-round-3/)
    as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program. We then added
    SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We will complete our full GDPR
    audit in 2018 ahead of GDPR going into effect. Our goal has always been to build
    and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with multiple frameworks.
    In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: [one control, many frameworks](https://datica.com/blog/what-makes-hitrust-understanding-the-superset-nature-of-hitrust/).\n
    \                                                                                       \n##
    GDPR applies to all personal data storage\n\n[GDPR is getting outsized attention](https://www.eugdpr.org/)
    because it applies to all personal data storage and processing, limiting or putting
    at risk all companies that leverage individually identifiable data (think of Google
    and Facebook, not just healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital
    health companies). GDPR also applies to organizations that control or process
    data for citizens of EU Member States regardless of where the organization is
    based.\n\nHealthcare and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset
    of GDPR and specifically applies to data concerning physical and mental health,
    genetic data, and biometric data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable
    overlap with HIPAA, and to an even larger extent, HITRUST.\n\n## GDPR entities:
    controllers and processors\n\nIn the world of HIPAA, you’re either a covered entity
    (CE) or a business associate (BA); for the purposes of this guide, subcontractors
    are just business associates of business associates. In the world of GDPR, you’re
    either a controller or a processor. The structures don’t mirror each other 100%
    but controllers, like covered entities, are the organizations that ultimately
    own personal data and processors, like business associates, provide services,
    or data processing, for controllers.\n\nThe major difference is that HIPAA strictly
    defines covered entities based on functions in healthcare as providers, payors,
    and clearinghouses whereas GDPR defines controllers as “natural or legal person,
    public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
    the purposes and means of processing of personal data.” HIPAA defines entities
    based on the function of the organization and GDPR defines it based on the ownership
    of data; this is a consistent theme throughout GDPR. \n\nMy interpretation of
    GDPR, and a significant area of difference that healthcare organizations need
    to consider, is that direct to consumer health offerings like Fitbit, MapMyRun,
    or an application for medical adherence created by a pharmaceutical company, would
    be considered controllers whereas in the US, under HIPAA, they wouldn’t need to
    adhere to HIPAA until they worked with customers or patients of a provider or
    payor. When those same direct to consumer companies in the US did work with providers
    and payors, they would be considered business associates and not covered entities.
    This flips the model for these companies as they are now the focal point of data
    control and risk under GDPR.\n\nControllers, like covered entities, are ultimately
    responsible and liable for the protection of data. As such, controllers need to
    put data processing agreements (DPA) in place with processor partners; similarly,
    covered entities under HIPAA must put business associate agreements (BAAs) in
    place with business associates. GDPR is more prescriptive in terms of what needs
    to be included in a DPA, something that is much needed in the US but is lacking
    in the HIPAA rules. The prescriptive nature of DPAs ensures additional protection
    and transparency over the wild west of BAAs in the US. One of the things GDPR
    requires, with some rare exceptions, in DPAs is that data is destroyed once the
    relationship between controller and processor ends; this severely limits the ability
    of processors to aggregate and retain personal data for future use. And, similarly
    to the US and HIPAA after the Omnibus rule was passed, processors under GDPR must
    have similar DPAs in place with their own processor partners.\n\n## GDPR breach
    reporting\n\nUnder GDPR, there are strict breach reporting requirements. The timeline
    to report breaches is 72 hours from becoming aware of a breach. Any organization
    adhering to HIPAA would have breach reporting timelines in policies, contracts,
    and/or BAAs; but, most breach reporting times we see from major cloud providers
    and vendors are on the order of days (10 days being the shortest we’ve seen),
    weeks, and even months. The lowest time we’ve seen for breach reporting is our
    own Datica breach reporting time, which is 4 hours. For entities looking to comply
    with GDPR, there are changes that need to be made both technically and operationally
    to commit to 72 hour breach reporting.\n\n## Health data access under GDPR\n\nGDPR
    puts forth clear guidelines for when health data can be processed, or essentially
    when it can be accessed. Under GDPR, health data can only be accessed 1) with
    explicit consent from the individual, 2) for health and social care, and 3) for
    public health (cross border containment being the example given). There are some
    nuances to this, specifically with data for scientific or clinical research, but
    those are mainly only with explicit consent. HIPAA similarly defines permitted
    uses and disclosures of health data for 1) treatment, 2) payment, and 3) healthcare
    operations.\n\nSome of the harder areas of GDPR, at least in comparing it to HIPAA,
    are the rights of individuals to get access to all of their data and to be forgotten
    (have all their data deleted). Healthcare data is much more extensive than other
    types of data like payment data; it’s the reason complying with HIPAA isn’t the
    same as complying with PCI where you can essentially outsource payment processing
    to Stripe. Granting access to all personal health data or being able to delete
    all health data is a very high bar to meet, especially for large, bloated EHRs
    and legacy healthcare software.\n\n## Data Protection Impact Assessments\n\nOne
    of the things I like a lot about the GDPR is the overarching principle of data
    protection by design and default. Sadly, security, and compliance, is often an
    afterthought at best or perceived unnecessary box to check at worst. GDPR explicitly
    attempts to resolve this pattern. GDPR goes further than HIPAA, and in this way
    is very similar to HITRUST, in that it anchors risk assessment, analysis, and
    management to the entire lifecycle of products and services. GDPR requires controllers
    and processors to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), which are
    just a longer name for a risk assessment. These DPIAs should be performed before
    the start of development work and done periodically throughout the lifecycle of
    a product to ensure data is protected and secure. This risk-based model is similar
    to the way organizations are supposed to use HITRUST to develop a baseline risk
    model and then consistently update that baseline model. It’s the model we use
    at Datica and has made it easy for us to maintain continuous compliance for us
    and our customers.\n\nWhy should you care about the GDPR? If you do anything with
    healthcare data in the EU, then you are at risk of significant penalties for violations.
    The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue, whichever
    is highest. If you want to work in the EU or are already in the EU, you need to
    expand your compliance program and posture to minimize your risk.\n\n----                                                                                                    \nGoing
    forward, we’ll get into technical details and mappings between HIPAA and GDPR.
    We’ll also provide specific guidance to inform expansionary changes to security
    and compliance programs to bring them in line with GDPR. Fundamentally, addressing
    HIPAA and GDPR is about having security as a core tenet of operations; the major
    difference is ensuring that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance
    with each framework.\n\n"

    about Business Associate Agreements](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/):**
    \nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA
    and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main
    categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs), and business associates.
    The further down the line the subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the
    more confusion there is about who really is a business associate and who needs
    to sign a business associate agreement.\n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)*\n\n**[2017
    Healthcare Trends Part 1: The Rise of Patient as Consumer](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/):**
    \nThere’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed
    by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before
    in a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and
    often wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently.
    Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that
    follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These
    overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all
    sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty

    \nThis 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs,
    raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful
    Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs.
    In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained
    and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been
    at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to
    record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits
    to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.  \n*[Continue

    \nBy now you’ve likely heard of the CloudFlare parser bug that caused CloudFlare’s
    CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who
    you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event.
    \n\nAt Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs)
    relate to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application?
    If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?
    As it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly
    to these questions. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/cloudflare-data-breaches-and-the-hipaa-conduit-exemption/)*\n\n**[FHIR

    \nIn a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital
    health, including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered
    was that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped
    to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies
    are turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing
    complexities.  \n\nIn 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within
    the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought
    it a good time to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent
    in healthcare companies today. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/)*\n\n**[The
    Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/):**
    \nI saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?”
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.
    Even so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020. \n\nIn this article, we explore
    the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing
    in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/)*\n\n**[Announcing
    One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/):**
    \nToday we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with
    Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem
    of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament
    to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way
    possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. \n\nWe aim to empower the developer community to
    solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable,
    compliant, and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers
    need more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better
    pricing at scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard
    and Cerner Code. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)*\n\n**[5
    Steps to HITRUST Certification](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/):**
    \n“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST
    CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive
    beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and
    point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis
    Good, Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica. \n\nComplying with
    HIPAA and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can
    point you to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the
    various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification,
    the only way to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we
    have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure
    they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance
    easier for our customers. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)*\n\n**[Opportunities
    for Digital Health Vendors in the Pharmaceutical Industry](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/):**
    \nNaomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation
    and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as
    Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships,
    she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare
    professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the
    molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers.
    In our July, 2017 podcast \n\nDr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting
    in a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems
    innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working
    with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/)*\n"

  :summary: 'In this 3rd part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series, Travis Good MD,
    CEO of Datica, offers a deep look at what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. '
  :blog_lead: "Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH
    and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health
    record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who
    support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have
    delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the
    outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are
    here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and,
    by extension, patients.\n\nIn this third part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. "
  :post: "\nToday, EHRs are in use by [95+% of eligible providers](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Hospital-Progress-to-Meaningful-Use-by-size-practice-setting-area-type.php).
    With that massive adoption, EHRs, at least the meaningful use certified EHRs deemed
    by the government worthy of carrot and stick adoption incentives, play two foundational
    roles in healthcare today.\n\n1. **EHRs are the hub of patient data.** They collect
    and store both subjective information and objective data from devices. They store
    reports and other kinds of file attachments. They store discrete data.\n2. **EHRs
    are the hub of clinical workflow.** Though EHRs are designed for general workflows,
    they don’t provide the tailored fit clinicians actually need forcing them to have
    to adapt their workflows to EHRs and not the other way around as it should be.
    Orders, messages, referrals, you name it. If providers are not entering or looking
    for data in the EHR, they are using the EHR to accomplish a task.\n\nThese two
    roles are foundational to building solutions, technology, or technology-enabled
    processes on top of the EHR; there are exceptions to this rule but, increasingly,
    even these exceptions are being forced to integrate. This changes everything,
    especially for those innovators in healthcare that are trying to develop solutions
    for providers and patients. But, almost as importantly, it forces EHRs to now
    either a) build new solutions themselves, b) support new 3rd party solutions,
    or c) risk replacement by newer EHRs that do either a or b. This process isn’t
    happening overnight, but it is happening.\n\nHealthcare technology tends to cycle
    every 15 years or so between best-of-breed solutions and all-in-one platforms.
    Today’s EHRs are at the tail end of a 15-year cycle that has seen their adoption
    grow massively as healthcare providers have implemented one of a few EHR options
    as platforms. Now, we are starting to cycle back to best-of-breed solutions as
    it has become abundantly clear that monolithic EHRs cannot develop solutions fast
    enough to meet the demands of the market. One platform cannot do everything. And
    EHRs, at least the major ones, are trying a mix of the a and b strategy above
    to hold their place as the central healthcare IT software.\n\n## EHRs still control
    access to patient data\n\nEHRs still control access to data and clinician workflows
    and have used that control to slow down adoption of new digital health solutions.
    EHRs have developed proprietary programs, or app stores/orchards/ programs, in
    attempts to support, whether that support is real or perceived, 3rd party solutions
    — Epic has App Orchard, Cerner has Cerner Cares, Allscripts has the Allscripts
    Developer Program, and Athena has More Disruption Please (there are more examples,
    but these are the big four). While programs from Athena and Allscripts are mature
    at this point, the emerging programs from Epic and Cerner have been slow to take
    off at best or failing at achieving any meaningful adoption at worst. The reasons
    for their slow take off or failure are partially technology-related (the app stores
    are proprietary) and partially business-model related (Apple can take 30% of app
    store partner revenue because Apple is the primary driver of revenue whereas EHRs
    are trying to collect 30% of revenue as a tax merely to integrate with them.)
    The $15-20K EHR integration price tag we grew to loathe is now a 30% tax on partner
    revenue.\n\nAt the same time EHRs try to support 3rd party applications, they
    are trying to build their own solutions to shut out digital health products. Every
    EHR now has a data warehousing solution, most have a population health tool, and
    many have telemedicine offerings. Similarly to Microsoft’s strategy of using its
    Windows and Office customer base to sell Azure cloud services, EHRs are trying
    to sell their own new products. The problem is none of the major EHRs are as savvy,
    either technically or business-wise, as Microsoft.\n\n## The Slow Burn of FHIR\n\nConcurrently,
    many major EHRs are supporting FHIR as a standard way to access EHR data. Some
    of that support may be vaporware, but most EHRs are at least announcing [FHIR
    capabilities](https://datica.com/guide/fhir/). FHIR has been in discussions for
    several years and, despite a lot of broad-based support, is moving painfully slowly
    towards adoption and actual implementation. Yes, the big four may support reading
    data from their EHRs via FHIR, but there is very little a real application can
    do by only reading data from the EHR. At times, the slow pace of FHIR adoption
    seems intentional by the many incumbents supporting it. Despite that, a recent
    survey found that health system CIOs consider FHIR to be the technology with the
    [most promise in 2018](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/interoperability/cios-see-fhir-potential-game-changer-and-blockchain-overhyped-survey),
    meaning FHIR is here to stay.\n\n## Is Replacing EHRs the Path Forward?\n\nIf
    EHRs are failing to support 3rd-party solutions and failing to develop and sell
    their own digital health products fast enough, does that leave option C — replacing
    EHRs — as the only path forward? \n\nNot exactly. \n\nAs both the hub of data
    and hub of clinical workflow, EHRs are extremely entrenched today. The vast majority
    of health system IT department resources are dedicated to supporting EHRs, so
    there are strange incentive conflicts. And, FHIR has been highly effective at
    buying EHRs more time.\n\nAs I said before, this process is not happening overnight,
    but it is happening. More industry leaders are [speaking out against EHRs](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180122/NEWS/180129979)
    and the rampant blocking of innovation so needed in healthcare. EHRs can only
    buy so much time. What I think we are going to see over the next 3-5 years, a
    time that also coincides with when a lot of health systems will have written down
    the heavy upfront capital expense of EHRs, is EHRs becoming less and less a clinical
    workflow tool and more and more a clinical encounter documentation tool and one
    source, not the primary hub, of clinical data.\n\nThere are two parts to that
    prediction. The first just means that we’re going to see purpose-built tools for
    specific workflows. We already see that today with clinical communication tools
    like [Voalte](http://www.voalte.com/) that are making the lives of nurses easier
    by enabling them to use a fast, mobile, purpose-built platform for their workflows
    and communications. The second is piggybacking on the inevitable march toward
    continuous and complete patient data. EHR data today is episodic. Clinical data
    tomorrow will include episodic EHR data but also remote monitoring data, social
    data, genetic data, and always-on sensor data. The EHR data will be one part of
    a much larger puzzle. I think the EHRs of today, the large ones I mention in this
    post, have too much technical debt to move fast enough to serve as the hub of
    clinical data tomorrow. They are saddled with their history.\n\n## 6 Predictions
    about EHRs in 2018\n\nPredictions are easy when you don’t have specific timelines.
    So what do I think we’ll see with EHRs and clinical data in 2018?\n\n1. **More
    direct patient access to EHR data.** There was already a major announcement of
    [Apple enabling its customers to access Epic and Cerner data](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/apple-health-app-effort-to-engage-consumers-by-sharing-ehr-info).\n2.
    **More available production FHIR services.** Most of these will be couched as
    pilots or beta, but progress is progress. FHIR will also be used for direct patient
    access to data.\n3. **Social determinants of health matter…a lot.** Everybody
    always cites studies that show WHO data of high US healthcare spending with resultant
    lousy health outcomes. This is true. And sad. But it’s not the whole story. In
    the US, we spend far less on social programs and services than most countries
    that beat our health outcomes. The result is a health system that doubles as a
    social safety net, with all costs incurred by the health system. Social data and
    care based on that data will be a major shift in 2018, and I think most of that
    will happen outside the EHR, at least regarding data sources and storage.\n4.
    **Demand for data access by EHR customers.** One of the challenges when integrating
    with an EHR is that the default answer is usually “no”. There is invariably friction
    to overcome and it is up to the health system to overcome this friction. I think
    2018 we will see a lot less acceptance of “no” and more pushing for EHRs to open
    up access to data, whether that data is exposed via FHIR or HL7 v2.x or a proprietary
    API middle layer like that provided by Sansoro Health.\n5. **Mega-mergers require
    new strategies around data sharing from unwilling players.** Large-scale mergers
    like Dignity/CHI and Providence-St. Joseph’s/Ascension will show vendors willing
    to demonstrate a more willing ability to play nice so that they don’t lose market
    share as hundreds of hospital sites are brought under one IT umbrella for the
    sake of efficiency. Epic has already shown some cards around this with their [Come
    Together/Happy Together/Working Together](https://www.epic.com/epic/post/3222)
    trio, but it’s hard to say if it’ll stave off mega losses in the usual hospital
    merger shakeup where two EHR vendors enter and only [one leaves](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/advocate-health-care-aurora-healthcare-epic-ehr-merger-care-coordination).\n6.
    **More ambulatory EHR providers bite the dust.** Now that the dust of Meaningful
    Use has settled, more companies are beginning to evaluate if they want to stay
    at the EHR table. With Allscripts acquiring both McKesson’s EHR suite and Practice
    Fusion (at a loss), anticipating more contraction in the EHR space as disinterested
    players try to divest assets while they are still holding water (GE Centricity,
    Greenway) seems like a safe bet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might want

  :lead: Leaders of healthcare providers, payers and third party vendors have formed
    an alliance to regulate the interpretation of healthcare’s inconsistent view of
    standards. That alliance is called HITRUST and provides a common security framework
    (CSF). The HITRUST CSF is rapidly becoming the future of healthcare compliance
    validation.
  :body: "## What is HITRUST?\nThe Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST) is
    an organization who, in partnership with technology and information security leaders,
    created and maintains the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF). \n\n<div class=\"callout

    is HITRUST?](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/)\n* [What is the HITRUST

    [HITRUST Inheritence](https://datica.com/blog/hitrust-inheritance-the-most-important-compliance-announcement-of-the-year/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HITRUST CSF is a certifiable framework that encompasses and harmonizes several
    other compliance frameworks and standards including HIPAA, HITECH, PCI, ISO/IEC,
    COBIT, NIST RMF, and varying state requirements. This framework serves as a system
    infrastructure roadmap for healthcare organizations to certify that they securely
    create, access, store, or transmit protected health information (PHI).\n\n## Why
    does HITRUST matter?\nAs healthcare is becoming further dependent on evolving
    technologies to store and transmit data, cybersecurity and compliance have become
    a progressively emphasized, yet convoluted, matter. Navigating the tortuous labyrinth
    of federal, state and third party security mandates has become a feat that can
    quickly consume an organization’s resources.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, getting
    through all of the twists, turns, and pitfalls to achieve compliance are only
    half the battle. Healthcare organizations and IT vendors must also prove their
    compliance to guarantee they are a trusted business partner. In fact, many large
    hospitals and health systems are now highly recommending that business associates
    and partners pursue HITRUST certification. Already the most widely adopted assessment,
    the CSF Assurance Program is forcing business associates to assess and report
    on their data privacy and security position or risk losing their contracts and
    renewals with healthcare systems.\n\nMany people ask how to prove HIPAA compliance
    and the answer to that question is with HITRUST CSF certification.\n\n## What
    is the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF)?\nThe HITRUST CSF is divided into
    nineteen different control domains and defines one hundred thirty five specific
    controls within those domains that can be implemented at three different levels.\n\n<div

    Specific Controls with 3 Implementation Levels\nIn addition to the above domains,
    HITRUST has defined one hundred thirty five specific controls. For each of those
    controls, three distinct implementation levels exist. Each implementation level
    builds on the one before it, with level three having the most stringent set of
    requirements. \n\nImplementation levels in the CSF are determined for each organization
    based on their risk profile, accounting for aspects like the size of an organization
    and the number of stored health records. \n\n## The HITRUST CSF Assessment\nThe
    first thing that happens with a HITRUST assessment is information gathering on
    the entity being assessed. This information is used to gauge the organization,
    system, and regulatory requirements for the assessment to determine the risk and
    scope. In contrast to HIPAA, which subjectively states that controls should be
    implemented that are “reasonable and appropriate,” HITRUST is prescriptive in
    dynamically assigning implementation levels for each requirement.\n\n### 3 Degrees
    of Assurance\nThe three Degrees of Assurance are essentially levels of assessment
    that align with cost, level of effort, amount of time, and rigor. Each level builds
    on the one before it: \nA Self Assessment results in a HITRUST issued CSF Self
    Assessment Report.\nCSF Validated means a third-party, HITRUST-approved CSF Assessor
    has verified the information gathered by the organization completing the assessment
    with an onsite visit. A Validated Report is the outcome.\nCSF Certified means
    the organization meets all of the certification requirements of the CSF. This
    builds on the CSF Validated assessment in that HITRUST reviews and certifies the
    entries of the organization and the validation of the third party assessor. \n\n###
    How Long Does CSF Certification Take?  \nIt varies on the size and complexity
    of the organization but, in the case of Datica, it took three to four months.\n\n###
    How Much Does HITRUST Cost?\nThe total cost of the HITRUST Assessment is $60,000-$80,000,
    including estimated direct and indirect costs as appraised by Datica's compliance
    experts. If you are considering HITRUST, cost is not the only consideration. Audits
    are time consuming and distracting, factors that are hard to quantify. Not only
    that, but the process needs to be repeated on an annual basis. \n\nHITRUST isn’t
    easy, and it shouldn’t be. The experience Datica has gained as a company and the
    extensive testing of our technology brings great value to our customers. Our HITRUST
    Certification is helping our customers prove their applications and data are secure
    by being an even more compelling proof than our HIPAA audits. If you’re already
    a Datica customer, there’s nothing you need to do; the Datica Compliant Cloud
    infrastructure you’re hosting on is HITRUST CSF Certified."
