:post: "<img alt=\"himss-2018-logo\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/BejYKjLiuWuE0iEK6WQIM/521488e52b97804bab49f7dd0a1994e2/himss-2018-logo.png?w=240\"
  width=\"120\" class=\"float-left-on-medium\" />\n\nHIMSS 2018 saw the presence of
  three of the largest tech companies in the world flex their muscles. The event itself
  is evidence that innovation is now a part of the healthcare bloodstream.\n\n## The
  3 largest tech companies flex their muscles at HIMSS\n\n### Microsoft showcased
  Azure at HIMSS\n\nDue to their rich health IT history, Microsoft has engaged with
  HIMSS in the past, but the company’s positioning in 2018 is noteworthy. A through
  line across its booth facilities, its engagements, and in 1:1 conversations was
  a focus on modernizing health IT via intelligent solutions. Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) certainly had a presence, but it was grounded in usable tools like Office 365
  and Microsoft Teams. Any cloud reference had less to do with Azure itself and more
  to do with Microsoft solutions on the cloud. \n\n### AWS went big HIMSS\n\nFor the
  first time in its history, AWS went big with an impressive HIMSS booth. This major
  physical presence is the only major one in healthcare outside of their own re:Invent
  conference. AWS had a mix of solution architecture Q&A, presentations from its broad
  partner ecosystem, and demonstrations of healthcare-specific cloud solutions available
  on AWS. Its 2018 presence showed AWS cares about being active in health IT and [AWS
  has a strong story to tell](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/hitrust-on-aws-is-possible-find-out-how-at-himss18/)
  with both new digital health companies and enterprise health IT. \n\n### Google
  went all out at HIMSS\n\nBut then we have Google. It also spent big — much bigger
  than Microsoft or AWS. Google had a major booth, but also several keynotes and high
  profile sessions that all must have cost enormous amounts in sponsorships. Of the
  three, it’s easy to see through total spend and coverage that Google is making the
  biggest bet that its cloud offerings can help healthcare. The only problem is understanding
  the actionable theme Google had in mind. Is it looking to help hospitals migrate
  old systems to Google’s cloud? Is it trying to get AI adopted in enterprises? The
  most consistent message centered on helping smaller startups succeed, which is then
  curious why Google would spend so much money getting in front of hospital CIOs.
  \n\nThe aggregate observation is big tech is looking to spend big dollars to land
  a big presence with this big event. All are here to stay this time. \n\n## Healthcare
  innovation was everywhere at HIMSS18\n\n### Certain innovations are now mature \n\nFrom
  the presence of the booths, the coverage within sessions, and the chatter amongst
  attendees, two major areas of innovation have finally made it: telehealth and population
  health. \nThose who follow healthcare know these two areas aren’t new, per se. But
  that’s not the point. The key observation from HIMSS18 is that, in the aggregate,
  all companies have “made it.” Their spend was enormous, their booths packed, their
  messages grand, and their sessions well attended. For upwards of a decade, we’ve
  talked about the eventuality of both telehealth and population health. Well, HIMSS18
  proved to us that the companies that figured out the models have finally crested
  the mountain in that long journey, and are now part of the health IT regulars. \n\n###
  The startups are mostly focused on AI \n\nMost early-stage companies were predominantly
  downstairs in the startup hub, but some were upstairs as well. Regardless of the
  location, a clear and obvious trend prevailed: Artificial Intelligence. AI is coming
  to healthcare. When it arrives, we aren’t certain. Much like telehealth, its timing
  will likely be tied to payment structures and when healthcare systems are allowed
  to receive reimbursement for its use. But the sheer volume of AI-focused business,
  products, and tools staggered attendees and it felt inevitable that AI will disrupt
  healthcare in some capacity. Our guess is that many net-new products will be deployed
  over the next two years, will show demonstrative impact, and then after that a larger
  watershed, will happen similarly to what we saw with telehealth and population health.
  \n\n### Net-new innovation is more popular on the cloud than migrating old systems
  \n\nLastly, we saw the [healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/healthcare-cloud/)
  as a mixed bag at HIMSS18. Conversation after conversation indicated a resistance
  to migrating old systems to the cloud. Ultimately, CIOs aren’t interested in the
  downside — higher hidden costs than the cloud vendor space indicates, high probability
  of downtime or failure of fragile systems during migration, and general unease with
  understanding risks and liabilities yet on the cloud. \n\nDatica ran a CHIME focus
  group with 18 hospital and health system CIOs. Across the board, their sentiment
  remained the same. Migration of existing systems just isn’t a priority. \nOn the
  flip side, much innovation is happening with new projects. These innovations can
  either be in the form of digital health products CIOs are purchasing, or as internal
  projects led by innovation groups. The cloud is not universally bad in the eyes
  of hospital CIOs. In fact, all 18 voiced the priority of cloud-first innovations
  when evaluating new tools or solutions. \nThis dichotomy became one of the more
  interesting observations from HIMSS18. You might also want to take a look at the
  thorough recap and analysis of that [CHIME focus group here](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).\n\n###
  More internal innovation is happening than many realize \n\nOne interesting thread
  throughout the entire conference hinged on the consistency of internal innovation
  being a focus. More conversations led to CIOs or innovation directors looking to
  internal resources for solving a specific problem at their system as opposed to
  buying a new product. \n\nIt’s not just centered with innovation groups, either.
  We were shocked to hear stories of how some institutions are completely rethinking
  innovation from the ground up, giving smaller teams more democracy in those innovations.
  The head of dermatology might be working on her own sanctioned project to innovate
  on a problem. The chief nursing officer might have the job of marshalling a skunkworks
  team to build a new tool for nurses. And so on. It’s happening across the country.
  \n\nIt’s great to see such innovation products constantly entering the health IT
  space. The level of sophistication in just the last few years has jumped considerably
  and will likely continue it’s rapid improvement through the coming years. \n\n\n"

  :summary: 'The “real cloud” in healthcare is not virtualization. We are talking
    about the public cloud and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. '
  :blog_lead: |-
    Information technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a [colossal chunk](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/electronic-health-records-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html) of their time supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors, health system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to EHRs, hospital IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies, that require care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications and you quickly see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog.

    At the same time, a significant strategic priority for healthcare organizations is assessing the cloud, developing a cloud strategy, and implementing that strategy. Most organizations are at some stage in this process. Many are still pre-implementation of a cloud strategy. But, it’s coming. And the health IT backlog is not conducive to the massive amount of work required to start moving technology to the cloud.
  :post: "\nWhat I mean by the cloud or the “real cloud” in my initial [2018 Healthcare
    Trends post](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/), is
    not virtualization. What I mean is the [public cloud](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
    and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The public cloud
    is not Epic hosting in Verona, with a data center that is managed and operated
    by Epic, or Cerner hosting in Kansas City, with a data center that is managed
    and operated by Cerner; those are private clouds dedicated to a specific application
    and purpose. The public cloud is different.\n\nThe public cloud is a powerful
    public utility and a force that will transform healthcare, not just healthcare
    IT. It is almost infinitely scalable with a growing laundry list of services and
    features that can be activated and accessed on demand. And, with new security
    features, it is now finally ready for prime time, meaning only that it is ready
    for healthcare organizations to develop and implement cloud strategies. The public
    cloud will enable many things for healthcare organizations.\n\n## The public cloud
    will:\n\n1. Get healthcare organizations out of the data center and infrastructure
    business, allowing focus on providing care, better services, and better products
    (meds and devices)\n2. Massively improve disaster recovery, aiding in meeting
    compliance requirements\n3. Accelerate innovation, enabling faster response and
    adaptation to market changes\n4. Improve and ease access to health data both for
    providers and patients\n5. Enhance visibility into security and compliance\n6.
    Enable new partnerships and integrations.\n\nDespite the scale and challenges
    of moving to the cloud, the cloud is coming to healthcare, and it’s coming faster
    than most people think. Look no further than HIMSS 2018 and the newly enlarged
    presence of major cloud providers Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. Healthcare on the cloud is strategic for every cloud
    provider. The challenge for these three behemoths is being in healthcare at the
    right time. These cloud providers are at HIMSS in 2018 because now is the right
    time, not because 2018 will be the year all healthcare organizations will move
    all their technology to the cloud; but, 2018 and 2019 will be the years most healthcare
    organizations start to implement a cloud strategy that will take years to execute.
    Microsoft, Amazon, and Google can’t miss those opportunities.\n\nI was listening
    to a [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/13/box-kubernetes-migration-with-sam-ghods/)
    podcast last week featuring one of the founders of [Box](https://www.box.com/home).
    The podcast focused on how Box has embraced the public cloud and why they have
    chosen to leverage Kubernetes. It’s a fascinating listen. One of the takeaways
    that map to the cloud trend in health IT is around how moving to the cloud is
    never one and done, even if you only have one large, monolithic application (in
    the case of the podcast, the one application was Box).\n\n## Hybrid cloud for
    3-5 more years\n\nDuring the next 3-5 years, we’re going to see a hybrid approach
    to the cloud for health IT where there is a mix of cloud applications and ground-based,
    or on-premise applications. This necessitates a new integration strategy to ensure
    secure and reliable connectivity between cloud and existing ground applications,
    not just integration between legacy applications and new applications; ground
    applications are typically legacy applications. This hybrid cloud strategy also
    necessitates management of multiple forms of technology infrastructure, cloud,
    and ground or on-premise.\n\n## Legacy applications either killed off or re-architected
    for public cloud\n\nAs healthcare organizations implement and start to scale their
    cloud strategies, more ground-based applications will move to the public cloud.
    Some set of these legacy applications, likely the last to move to the cloud, will
    be migrated as they are currently architected; that, or they’ll be sunsetted and
    killed off before they are migrated. Many more of these legacy ground applications
    will be re-architected as a part of the migration process. The reason to re-architect
    legacy applications is to:\n\n1) fully take advantage of the cloud (auto-scaling,
    auto-healing, redundancy, portability, etc.) and\n2) prevent lock-in with a specific
    cloud provider. \n\nWhile AWS, Azure, and GCP offer great cloud services and resources,
    healthcare organizations will want optionality and to avoid lock-in with cloud
    providers APIs and the specific flavor of services (containers, serverless, etc.).
    This re-architecture process will be a crucial part of the cloud strategy for
    healthcare organizations.\n\n## Public cloud requires new skillsets\n\nThe public
    cloud does require a unique skill set and should usher in a new paradigm (containers,
    security, serverless, DBaaS, etc.) for healthcare technologies. Hiring resources
    with the necessary skillsets are challenging to say the least. It’s challenging
    if you’re in Seattle or Boston. It’s nearly impossible if you’re in a rural location
    like many healthcare organizations. Access to the right skillsets to leverage
    public cloud will improve over time but health systems should, and likely will,
    leverage third parties that specialize in cloud computing; these third parties
    have matured along with the public cloud.\n\n## Security and compliance — a big
    challenge\n\nOne particularly outsized challenge associated with the cloud is
    security and compliance. The cloud has distinct advantages over the current, on-premise
    model but it also has the perceptive challenge of giving up the keys to the castle
    to a cloud provider. This perceptive challenge can and will be overcome, but it
    requires changes to the way healthcare organizations manage risk for their data
    and how they align that risk with liability from cloud providers acting as stewards
    of their data. Transparency, both legally in the form of [BAAs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-importance-of-business-associate-agreements-baas/)
    and [data processing agreements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/) and technically
    in the form of security dashboards, have never been more critical.\n\n\nIn leveraging
    third parties, both cloud providers for infrastructure and cloud specialists for
    migration, security, and compliance, healthcare IT and healthcare compliance will
    transform themselves. What those groups look like in a post-cloud world is hard
    to say, but it’s clear they will have to change to embrace this brave new world.
    This will not happen overnight.\n\nA lot of the above are impacts that will be
    felt long-term and not necessarily in 2018. But, as healthcare organizations begin
    their [journey to the cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/),
    some starting that journey at HIMSS this year, they need to consider all of this.
    Cloud strategies should be all-encompassing but also should be revisited on some
    regular period as the pace of the cloud does not show any signs of slowing down.\n\nI

  :summary: Where is healthcare going in 2018? In this sixth piece of the Datica Healthcare
    Trends series, we explore the fifth trend — moving beyond the digital health hype.
  :blog_lead: "Where is healthcare going in 2018? In the first article of Datica’s
    2018 Healthcare Trends series, I outlined [six trends for 2018](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/).
    I predict volatility as the government, individuals, and private sector demand
    change this year. In this sixth piece of the series, I explore the fifth trend
    — moving beyond the digital health hype.\n\nOver the last ten years, digital health
    has been met with much ballyhoo and corresponding investment. Even the “digital
    health” term has become broad and beyond its original intent. It’s helpful to
    define the term before diving into its evolution and current state. According
    to Wikipedia, [the digital health discipline is described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health)
    in the following way — “The discipline involves the use of information and communication
    technologies to help address the health problems and challenges faced by patients.” "
  :post: "\nThat’s broad. Very broad. \n\nDigital health is somewhat  synonymous with
    “healthcare technology,” with one caveat — healthcare technology is inclusive
    of electronic health records (EHRs) and I personally don’t group EHRs in with
    the broader digital health term.\n\nLike other verticals and in many consumer
    products, digital health has followed a similar trend. We saw initial hype around
    mobility, connectivity and consumerization of healthcare. While those trends are
    still relevant, healthcare, as yet has not been disrupted or upgraded to the same
    extent as industries like banking, retail, and even education. Those who have
    been in healthcare for a while have read a multitude of stories touting new companies
    and technologies that were destined to disrupt healthcare. All of those, except
    a select few, have failed. \n\nHere are a few of the obstacles digital health
    companies must overcome.\n\n## Scrutiny of technology spend is way up and proof
    is the antidote\n\nIn 2018, healthcare technology has finally [moved past the
    EHR era](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/). EHRs
    are now ubiquitous in healthcare organizations. As we all learned at HIMSS18,
    the good old days of Meaningful Use are over. However, one lingering consequence
    of Meaningful Use was an increase of the percentage of technology spend in most
    health systems budgets. That increased spend is now being scrutinized, and digital
    health must demonstrate solid proof of efficacy to overcome that scrutiny and
    succeed.\n\nIn the [Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/)
    Datica outlined the major challenges that digital health developers must traverse.
    Now, more than ever, digital health products need associated proof to overcome
    buyer and customer skepticism. The proof can broadly fall into the following buckets
    — lowering costs, improving care (especially in at-risk settings), and improving
    the care experience.\n\n## VCs invest in scalable technologies, but healthcare
    is siloed and localized \n\nVenture capital compounds the challenges of digital
    health. Building and scaling new technology products to meet venture capital demands
    falls out of alignment with selling and implementing demands of digital health
    within the enterprise. The localized nature of healthcare exacerbates the problem.
    Even for some larger systems that still buy technology at local or regional levels,
    one must wonder if most digital health technologies aren’t meant to be venture
    scale. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSome digital health companies have
    found success with a focus on localization. Those companies have discovered that
    while you may not be able to change the way care is delivered for millions of
    people you can, however, do that in one city. Scale in healthcare doesn’t have
    to be geographically global. Scaling to thousands of health systems is daunting,
    since many are finding ways to solve their problems without waiting for a well-funded
    digital health startup to save the day. \n\nOver the past year, I’ve talked to
    multiple investors who say they see many digital health companies solving the
    same problems with similar solutions, and all at similar stages ($1 - $2 million
    in annual revenue and 2-5 customers in the same geography). Who gets funded and
    how do they scale with anything resembling efficiency?\n\nEHRs don’t help the
    problem of scaling. Without a centralized clinical data repository; thousands
    of EHR silos exist all over the U.S. Selling to one Epic hospital is selling to
    one Epic hospital. You must go through the same extended implementation for each
    new hospital, with all the associated built-in pushback.\n\n## Proof and scale
    are necessary, but are they even possible?\n\nWhere does that leave us? Is there
    a way to 1) prove the ROI of a digital health product, and 2) scale that success
    quickly? I’m not sure. The system seems to be set up to prevent that from happening.
    The biggest companies I know that are strategically focused on getting into digital
    health, and these are some of the biggest companies in the world, are playing
    a very long game. Those companies know that success, at least regarding scale,
    is going to take many, many years. And they have the money and patience to play
    it out.\n\nThese companies are targeting providers because they are seen as the
    key to healthcare as the actual place of the transaction — care delivered and
    care received. Life sciences are sometimes seen as a faster path to success, but
    there are only so many life sciences companies and the investments those companies
    are making in digital health, and their strategies for digital health, are similarly
    long game strategies that involve being closer to care delivery.\n\nDespite the
    doom and gloom of the last few paragraphs, digital health will have a significant
    impact on healthcare. The question is timing. Regardless of the when, the how
    is clear — digital health needs to be able to prove it’s worth to get into the
    hands of patients and providers.\n\n"

    HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

    AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
  :post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
    healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time
    again.\n\nInnovative health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying
    to adopt AWS:\n\n1. **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push
    projects to internally owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving
    to the cloud, those initiatives can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the
    DevOps and cloud engineering resources needed outside of their control.\n\n2.
    **Internal Compliance does not approve of the low levels of liability taken on
    by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
    roughly 1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical
    level and firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's
    responsibility. Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned
    with Internal Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector.
    While AWS themselves have some of the best infrastructure security measures in
    the world, the operating system level is still the responsibility now of the organization
    to secure. That's a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem
    requiring hard-to-find resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll
    combined, most healthcare enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas,
    Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur,
    articulated this exact pain while giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe
    width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n##
    Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST
    has been a godsend.\n\nFor three years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified
    on top of AWS. Our Platform absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the
    cloud, which extends AWS's excellent coverage for compliance **of** the cloud.
    \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
    enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
    internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
    projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
    the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
    \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
    Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and
    compliance in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe
    result is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are
    making a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n##
    Live presentation for those who can't make it at HIMSS\n\nIf you are not attending
    HIMSS this year, or if you are unable to make the 11:00 am time slot on Tuesday,
    March 6th, we are holding a 30-minute webinar later in March to expand on Travis'
    presentation. Please join us if you can't visit us in person at HIMSS.\n\n[Visit
    our webinar overview to register for the March 21st presentation at 12:00 pm CST.](https://content.datica.com/hitrust-on-aws-2018-03-21)\n\nWhile
    you’re at HIMSS make sure to also visit the Datica booth, #5077. See you at HIMSS!\n\n\n"

  :summary: 'Travis Good, MD, Co-founder, CEO & Chief Privacy Officer of Datica and
    9-time HIMSS attendee shares his advice to surviving and staying sane at HIMSS18. '
  :blog_lead: |
    HIMSS is my most exhausting week of the year. I think this is my 9th HIMSS. Today, with 40,000+ attendees, it’s a logistical nightmare from start to finish. Everything from transportation to coffee is a challenge. Events go late into the night, and I always seem to have an early coffee or breakfast meeting, so sleep isn’t plentiful. I’m not sure if I prefer Las Vegas to Orlando as the location for HIMSS. Both have pros and cons.

    Below is my personal HIMSS survival guide. Hopefully, I can remember these things and keep my sanity next week.
  :post: "\n## Be patient\n\nWhen you cram 40,000+ people into any location, even
    a behemoth Las Vegas hotel and conference center like the Venetian, the trains
    rarely run on time. Getting a car. Getting to a booth. Getting coffee. They all
    take way longer than you would expect. It can rattle you if you’re used to things
    running on a schedule. I’ll give HIMSS credit in that sessions usually do stick
    to their assigned time slots. It’s everything else that gets off the rails. The
    best advice is to relax and be patient. You’ll get that car or coffee eventually,
    and there’s precious little you can do to make it any better. Embrace the chaos
    and enjoy the spectacle of HIT’s annual Lollapalooza.\n\n## Get out of the Venetian\n\nIf
    you don’t have to be at the Venetian for an event at a set place (including booth
    time), go somewhere else. I’ve probably been to conferences at the Venetian 5-6
    times, and it still confuses me how to get around. It’s vast so getting out is
    a commitment and likely something you’ll want to do at the start (breakfast) or
    end of the day. Getting out of the Venetian helps me to maintain my sanity and
    remember there is a real world out there where every conversation you hear isn't
    about Epic or [FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir/) or population health. The
    one caveat to this is if you’re dead set on mingling and trying to network in
    the hopes that you hit it off with the anonymous person you meet at the Venetian
    \n\n## Avoid the main entrances\n\nAs I wrote above, the Venetian is large, and
    the bowels are confusing to navigate. If you can find a way to avoid the main
    ways in or out, you’ll find shorter coffee and drink lines. The worst times for
    the main arteries into the Venetian are, not surprisingly, around the conference
    schedules. Attendees tend to follow schedules, especially for exhibit hall opening
    times and keynotes. If you can, you’re better off going early or late to avoid
    the rush.\n\n## Buffer your time\n\nI’d estimate less than 25% of my scheduled
    HIMSS meetings, not sessions, start on time. The exhibit hall is massive, so people
    always underestimate how long they need between meetings. The good part is, everybody
    at HIMSS knows that HIMSS is challenging so most people expect a certain portion
    of meetings to start late, get rescheduled, or to not start at all.\n\n## Bring
    a battery backup\n\nThe bowels of the Venetian, deep in the exhibit hall and session
    rooms, have spotty mobile coverage. Couple that with the hordes of people sharing
    the mobile networks and your phone will eat a lot of battery establishing and
    re-establishing connections. Wall outlets are popular to combat this. Having a
    battery backup is super convenient if you want your phone to be on all day.\n\n##
    Bring good shoes\n\nI usually average 15-20k steps a day at HIMSS. I don’t attend
    many sessions, so I’m on my feet pretty much all day. Comfortable shoes help make
    this a lot more pleasant.\n\n## Take notes\n\nI used to take notes religiously
    when I wrote for [HIStalk](https://histalk2.com) because I’d write up daily summaries
    of the conference each night. As an aside, the people at HIStalk deserve a ton
    of credit for reporting on HIMSS; it’s a herculean task and makes me feel bad
    about my HIMSS whining in this post. I still write notes today, and if you see
    me next week, I’ll have my notebook with me. I take notes on people I meet and
    market intelligence related to Datica. There’s a lot to see and take in at HIMSS,
    too much for me to remember without notes.\n\n## Get some swag\n\nI usually try
    to get things for my kids and my wife to reduce my guilt from being away. One
    of my favorites was touchscreen gloves from [Imprivata](https://www.imprivata.com).
    I also try to get as many stuffed fish as I can from [PilotFish](https://www.pilotfishtechnology.com),
    though they’ve made it harder each year to get multiple fish. Every year there
    is new and exciting stuff to be had in the HIMSS exhibit hall. Not objective,
    but if you want the best swag in 2018, stop by the Datica booth (booth 5077) and
    check out our [Yeti](https://www.yeti.com) cups.\n\n## Balance your caffeine intake\n\nHIMSS
    is like [coffee-obsessed Seattle](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/food/coffee-culture-seattle)
    to me in that I always feel over-caffeinated by late morning or early afternoon.
    When this happens, especially if I’m not hydrating, I feel pretty crappy. My goal
    this year is to limit my caffeine intake for 2-3 cups a day, which isn't too far
    off from my normal caffeine schedule. The Datica booth is going to be stocked
    with cold brew coffee for our team and those that stop by (booth 5077) so I’m
    hopeful my willpower overcomes the ease of caffeine access next week.\n\n## Keep
    smiling\n\nI have a lot of friends in HIT and enjoy running into people at HIMSS.
    It’s the one event each year where I get a chance to bump into specific people.
    As exhausting as the week is, it’s only really four days (M-Th) so smile and get
    through it.\n\n\nI hope to see you at HIMSS! Look for me at the Datica booth,
    #5077, or on Tuesday, March 6th at 11:00am in the Amazon Booth, #1625, for a talk
    I'm giving about HITRUST on AWS. \n\n\n\n\n"

    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###
    HIPAA Resources\n\n* [Understanding Business Associate Agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/)\n*
    [Datica HIPAA Mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)\n* [Learn the basics of HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/)\n*
    [Whis is HIPAA Important?](http://content.datica.com/why-is-hipaa-important )\n*

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica

    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
