:blog_lead: 'Many healthcare networks, hospitals, and physicians’ offices know they
  need to make improvements in order to see the greatest gains from advances in technology,
  and according to a recent report by the credit rating agency AM Best, insurers are
  in the same boat. '
:post: "\n## Areas Most in Need of Improvement\n\nThe report, titled, “Insurers —
  Behind the Technology Curve, and They Know It,” combines recommendations and results
  of a survey conducted by AM Best. According to the survey, [companies are focused
  on four primary areas](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/health-insurers-technology-upgrades-a-m-best)
  they consider to be most in need of technological improvement: customer experience;
  administrative and claim systems; data aggregation and mining; and underwriting/
  new business systems.\n\nOnly 3.5% of the respondents to the survey chose “risk
  management and compliance” as the area most in need of technological improvements.
  The majority, 33.3%, selected “customer experience” as the area most in need of
  tech improvements. \n\nOne reason that so many insurers are behind the technological
  curve is the high pace of acquisitions in the recent past. Building integrated systems
  to handle claims, data aggregation, and underwriting is a challenge when a patchwork
  of legacy systems is in place. \n\nUpgrading those legacy systems will automatically
  strengthen cybersecurity, which could be one reason so many of the survey respondents
  chose customer experience, legacy systems, and data aggregation rather than risk
  management as the area most in need of tech improvements. Improvements in any one
  of the three categories is likely to also improve security. \n\n## Legacy Systems
  Are a Problem Throughout Healthcare\n\nThe report specifically states that legacy
  systems “lack a high enough level of cybersecurity and can be compromised relatively
  easily, exacerbating operational risks,” according to an [article in Carrier Management](https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2018/02/21/175896.htm),
  confirming the idea that both upgrading legacy systems and improving the customer
  experience will lead to better security. \n\nJust as healthcare is looking toward
  the [post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/)
  of better interoperability, the payor side of the industry is also suffering from
  a lack of data accessibility. The report addresses the topic of legacy systems,
  saying, “Having a formal process to integrate data from an acquisition is imperative.”
  Many insurance companies simply rely on the knowledge of long-time employees. \n\n>
  The next five to 10 years will be a critical period, during which organizations
  must learn to use that institutional knowledge to modernize their core systems and
  combine it with new technologies.”\n\n## Partnerships May Help with Data Aggregation
  and Mining\n\nAdditionally, the information stored in disparate systems cannot be
  easily accessed, so insurers have a virtual treasure trove of information that they
  cannot mine. Advances in predictive modeling and machine learning could offer untapped
  business opportunities to insurers — as long as the data was both accessible and
  accurate. \n\nWorking with insurtech companies could improve business for carriers
  that “already have rich troves of information about policyholders on pricing, retention,
  churn, uplift from analytics, policy-specific information and underwriting,” according
  to the report. \n\nThe associate director of industry and analytics at AM Best,
  Jason Hopper, told Carrier Management, \n\n> Insurtech companies will find deploying
  these capabilities difficult as they lack scale, while insurers may lack the depth
  about the power of computing and machine-learning techniques. Still, the combination
  of the two could be powerful and may lead to an inflection point that could change
  the typical insurance model.” \n\n## Automation Could Follow Aggregation\n\nJust
  as updating legacy systems would naturally improve cybersecurity, tapping into the
  potential of the data they have already gathered would help insurance companies
  automate their underwriting processes and improve pricing. \n\nThe report suggests
  that taking advantage of tech must be part of the culture of an insurance company,
  and that the lead should come from the CEO’s office rather than the IT department.
  “They need to have an in-depth understanding of technological concepts and how they
  relate to specific business operations and strategy, given the potential for industry
  disruption,” Sridhar Manyem, director of industry research and analytics at AM Best
  [told the publication Canadian Insurance Top Broker](http://www.citopbroker.com/news/insurers-working-to-catch-up-to-technology-curve-a-m-best-report-13843).
  \n\nThe report concludes with a warning: \n\n> Companies that continue to evolve
  technologically will gain a substantial competitive advantage; competitors that
  don’t will suffer.” \n\nIndeed, the insurance industry has only to examine the evolution
  of technology in the healthcare industry to see how much new tech can improve operations,
  as well as how organizations that don’t invest are left behind. \n\n\n"

  :summary: Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care,
    or concierge medicine, cutting out the payors is 1 of 6 2018 trends Datica predicts.
  :blog_lead: Where is healthcare going in 2018? In the first article in this series,
    I outlined [six trends for 2018](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    I predict we’ll see as the government, individuals, and private sector demand
    change this year. The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay practices.
    Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge
    medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.
  :post: "What do you do when you get so frustrated with inefficiency and intermediaries
    in a transaction? If you’re like most consumers today, you’ll find a way to go
    directly to the supplier — meaning anybody producing a product or service that
    is of value to customers. There are huge technology leaps being made that have
    eliminated logistical challenges and enabled suppliers to have new or improved
    direct access to customers; as you can see below, it’s also created many opportunities
    for new, very large businesses. \n\nHere’s a short list of direct-to-supplier
    examples:\n\n* Alibaba allows you to order directly from factories in China. It
    eliminates retailers. This is typically used for commercial merchandise and equipment.
    Try it. It’s incredible what you can customize for an order of 1 and have directly
    shipped to you.\n* Etsy connects small, niche makers to sell directly to customers.
    It eliminates retailers and opens up huge geographies for makers. Etsy has gotten
    a lot of bad press lately but that doesn’t change the underlying premise.\n* Patreon
    enables creators to be sponsored by fans, or patrons, through subscriptions. It
    provides artists more freedom to pursue their craft with direct support from fans.\n*
    Stratechery is a subscription technology analysis publication. It eliminates publishers.
    It’s one person, Ben Thompson, that has built a personal brand outside of traditional
    publishing channels. There are many such publications but Stratechery is a personal
    favorite.\n* The Athletic is a subscription local sports publication. It eliminates
    traditional paper press. It enables local sports writers to provide deeper insight
    into players and teams through long-form publishing that doesn’t fit well with
    where traditional newspapers have evolved.\n* Netflix sells on-demand video content
    directly to consumers. It reduces the demand for cable bundles and, in the process,
    traditional advertisers. Now, with public market funding, Netflix is building
    the largest content catalog in the world and selling access to it directly to
    consumers.\n\n## Healthcare transactions are frustrating for consumers and providers\n\nIf
    you were to poll people on the most frustrating experiences they’ve had with transactions,
    I’d wager that healthcare ranks number one. The commercial payor process in healthcare
    is broken to the core, mostly by design, to create friction that intentionally
    minimizes payment to providers and reduces the liability of payors. The process
    sucks for both sides.\n\nConsumers typically have insurance through employers,
    reducing or eliminating choice. Payors then have networks of approved providers,
    thereby dictating which providers those consumers are allowed to see, again reducing
    choice. Then, when consumers go to their provider to get care it’s nearly impossible
    to have an accurate idea of their responsibility before a service is provided;
    they only find out much later how much the service cost, how much the payors haggled
    the price down, what the payor covered, and what amount is left for the individual
    to pay.\n\nBelieve it or not, the provider side is worse. Payors are heavy handed
    — to put it mildly — with providers in negotiating payment rates. For example,
    commercial payors pay providers vastly different rates based on the supply and
    demand for different specialties in different geographic areas. Payors also drag
    their feet and take anywhere from 60 days to 6 months after applications are submitted
    to approve new fully-licensed physicians and add them to their networks. Then,
    providers submit claims and those claims are either rejected (based on real or
    not even real mistakes in claim submission and documentation) or paid within some
    period of time (usually 30 to 90 days). Providers can then dispute rejected claims.
    This is a lot of work and providers spend lots of money to increase collections
    and speed the time to collections; simplistically this is “revenue cycle management”
    and is a multibillion-dollar industry in its own right in healthcare.\n\nWhen
    something goes wrong, consumers often blame providers; read provider reviews online
    and you’ll see many of them are complaints about payment. It’s a lot easier to
    blame the provider, with a face in front of you, vs the payor with it’s oftentimes
    outsourced call center service options.\n\n## The commercial insurance model of
    care insulates both providers and patients\n\nOne of the major hurdles in applying
    free market principles to healthcare in the United States is that, as I laid out
    above, the parties involved in the healthcare services transaction — the provider
    and the patient — are insulated from the financial transaction. I’m talking about
    the commercial insurance model of care that dominates our health system today.
    In this model, while there is typically some financial exchange with patients
    paying a deductible and, at times, some amount of patient responsibility at or
    before care is provided, oftentimes the bulk of payment for healthcare services
    is done separately, insulating providers and patients. This insulation is true
    even of providers in small private practices and is especially true for employed
    physicians who typically track what are called relative value units (RVUs), not
    collections, that determine their salaries; RVUs are a topic unto themselves and
    beyond the scope of this post.\n\n## Are cash-pay medical practices the solution?\n\nWhat’s
    the reaction to this? Cut out the payors. This is what cash-pay medical practices
    are all about. Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary
    care, or concierge medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.
    This is providers and consumer reacting to the frustration and overhead of working
    with payors. The desirable outcomes are similar for both providers and patients
    — longer appointments, more timely access to providers (off hours is usually included),
    and real accountability.\n\nCash-pay medicine has seen a tremendous growth in
    popularity and will continue to grow as the traditional commercial insurance model
    of healthcare continues to get worse. [Survey data consistently shows](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/01/30/1-in-10-doctor-practices-flee-medicare-to-concierge-medicine/#4819d6514568)
    that a high number of providers are interested in switching to concierge medicine.
    Sadly, the poster children for building networks and scaling cash-pay medicine
    have not fared well —  [QLiance](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/qliance-closes-after-10-year-effort-at-new-approach-to-basic-medical-care/)
    and [Turntable Health](https://lasvegasweekly.com/intersection/2017/jan/11/turntable-healths-closure-leaves-downtown-patients/)
    have struggled and had to shut down. [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com)
    has grown more slowly than expected and has had to raise almost $250M in the process.
    \ Some, like [MedLion](https://medlion.com), are trying to sell subscription medicine,
    mainly virtual care, through employers.\n\nThe lessons from these companies is
    not that cash-pay medicine doesn’t work ([here’s data](https://stateofreform.com/news/industry/healthcare-providers/2015/01/qliance-study-shows-monthly-fee-primary-care-model-saves-20-percent-claims/)
    showing saving from cash pay), it’s that scaling a network of cash-pay medical
    practices is very hard in today’s healthcare environment. Cash-pay practices that
    hold old on and remain outside the system will be smaller, more independent practices.
    That’s the biggest obstacle to cash-pay medicine — converting small practices
    is hard and perceived as very risky. But, those smaller, independent cash-pay
    practices are starting to share their stories and insights through online forums.
    These online forums, like Facebook groups, are reducing the barriers for providers
    to convert practices to cash pay. I personally know multiple physicians who are
    planning to convert to cash-pay practices in 2018 and their main source of information
    is Facebook.\n\nAt the same time, consumers/patients are more open to cash-pay
    practices. As healthcare delivery and traditional, claims-based payment have become
    more convoluted, consumers have become more willing to pay directly for higher-level
    access to their providers. I don’t think a large portion of the public is ready
    to spend $150-$200/mo. for concierge medicine but I do think a decent proportion
    is willing to pay $40-70/mo.\n\nAs more providers leave traditional payor based
    healthcare to open cash-based practices, more consumers are willing to sign up.
    And, as that happens, we are seeing more digital health technologies built to
    help cash-based practices — [Hint Health](https://hint.com) manages the back office,
    [Atlas.MD](https://atlas.md) is a subscription-based practice EHR, and [Spruce
    Health](https://sprucehealth.com) connects providers directly to patients and
    allows practices to easily offer new, differentiated services to patients. This
    is the cycle that will push more cash-pay medicine into healthcare. \n\nCash-pay
    medicine is not for every provider and not for every consumer. But, it does fit
    well with a growing number of independent practices that want to remain viable
    and can’t survive against larger provider networks and health systems. I predict
    2018 will be the year that cash pay, subscription medicine becomes a real option
    for both providers and patients.\n\nFollow the healthcare trends series by subscribing

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

  :summary: Our Healthcare Innovators podcast continues with an illuminative interview
    with Aaron Neinstein, MD on tech that tames the deluge of patient generated data.
  :blog_lead: We continue our conversations on the subject of healthcare innovation
    with an illuminative podcast interview with Aaron Neinstein, MD. [UCSF’s Dr. Neinstein](https://aaronneinstein.com/)
    gives us a view into some of the promising technologies emerging to organize,
    digest, and analyze the massive amounts of patient-generated data we are quickly
    becoming inundated with. Neinstein also shares his ideas about what we can expect
    to see in the near future, as clinicians gain access to this data.
  :post: "\nHere are a just few of the many ideas you’ll hear in Datica’s Healthcare
    Innovators Series Podcast, [“Emerging Healthcare Data Challenges from Patient
    Centric Technologies.”](https://datica.com/innovation/aaron-neinstein-md-emerging-healthcare-data-challenges-from-patient-centric-technologies/)\n\n-
    **On openness to patient generated data:** “A big thing is more incentives from
    the payors, so over the last two years, we've seen the introduction of the Medicare
    chronic care management codes which create the payment opportunity for use of
    patient-generated health data. What those codes do is allow you to bill on on
    a monthly ongoing basis for taking care of a patient who has two or more chronic
    diseases. You could theoretically have a nurse or someone else on your staff managing
    the patient remotely and be billing for that time.”\n\n- **On other disease communities
    using diabetes as a model for technology and tech services:** “One place in particular
    where we are seeing similarities to diabetes is with asthma. If you think about
    capturing the action and activity that a patient takes in the normal course of
    the day. That's what we are talking about here; these are chronic diseases, where
    coming in for an office visit three or four times a year allows a narrow snapshot
    of what's happening in somebody's life. The reason we care about patient-generated
    health data is in theory because it gives us the opportunity to see what somebody
    is doing day-to-day, 24/7, 365 in the context of their life, and tweak their treatment
    regimen or change their behavior to improve the management of their chronic disease.”\n\n-
    **On how EHRs fit into the future of patient-generated data:** “I think one of
    the things that people don't think about is how many different categories of patient-generated
    health data there actually are. If you break it down, you are talking about 7
    or 8 categories of things that comprise what we now called PGHD.”\n\nSubscribe

  :summary: 'In this 3rd part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series, Travis Good MD,
    CEO of Datica, offers a deep look at what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. '
  :blog_lead: "Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH
    and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health
    record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who
    support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have
    delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the
    outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are
    here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and,
    by extension, patients.\n\nIn this third part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. "
  :post: "\nToday, EHRs are in use by [95+% of eligible providers](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Hospital-Progress-to-Meaningful-Use-by-size-practice-setting-area-type.php).
    With that massive adoption, EHRs, at least the meaningful use certified EHRs deemed
    by the government worthy of carrot and stick adoption incentives, play two foundational
    roles in healthcare today.\n\n1. **EHRs are the hub of patient data.** They collect
    and store both subjective information and objective data from devices. They store
    reports and other kinds of file attachments. They store discrete data.\n2. **EHRs
    are the hub of clinical workflow.** Though EHRs are designed for general workflows,
    they don’t provide the tailored fit clinicians actually need forcing them to have
    to adapt their workflows to EHRs and not the other way around as it should be.
    Orders, messages, referrals, you name it. If providers are not entering or looking
    for data in the EHR, they are using the EHR to accomplish a task.\n\nThese two
    roles are foundational to building solutions, technology, or technology-enabled
    processes on top of the EHR; there are exceptions to this rule but, increasingly,
    even these exceptions are being forced to integrate. This changes everything,
    especially for those innovators in healthcare that are trying to develop solutions
    for providers and patients. But, almost as importantly, it forces EHRs to now
    either a) build new solutions themselves, b) support new 3rd party solutions,
    or c) risk replacement by newer EHRs that do either a or b. This process isn’t
    happening overnight, but it is happening.\n\nHealthcare technology tends to cycle
    every 15 years or so between best-of-breed solutions and all-in-one platforms.
    Today’s EHRs are at the tail end of a 15-year cycle that has seen their adoption
    grow massively as healthcare providers have implemented one of a few EHR options
    as platforms. Now, we are starting to cycle back to best-of-breed solutions as
    it has become abundantly clear that monolithic EHRs cannot develop solutions fast
    enough to meet the demands of the market. One platform cannot do everything. And
    EHRs, at least the major ones, are trying a mix of the a and b strategy above
    to hold their place as the central healthcare IT software.\n\n## EHRs still control
    access to patient data\n\nEHRs still control access to data and clinician workflows
    and have used that control to slow down adoption of new digital health solutions.
    EHRs have developed proprietary programs, or app stores/orchards/ programs, in
    attempts to support, whether that support is real or perceived, 3rd party solutions
    — Epic has App Orchard, Cerner has Cerner Cares, Allscripts has the Allscripts
    Developer Program, and Athena has More Disruption Please (there are more examples,
    but these are the big four). While programs from Athena and Allscripts are mature
    at this point, the emerging programs from Epic and Cerner have been slow to take
    off at best or failing at achieving any meaningful adoption at worst. The reasons
    for their slow take off or failure are partially technology-related (the app stores
    are proprietary) and partially business-model related (Apple can take 30% of app
    store partner revenue because Apple is the primary driver of revenue whereas EHRs
    are trying to collect 30% of revenue as a tax merely to integrate with them.)
    The $15-20K EHR integration price tag we grew to loathe is now a 30% tax on partner
    revenue.\n\nAt the same time EHRs try to support 3rd party applications, they
    are trying to build their own solutions to shut out digital health products. Every
    EHR now has a data warehousing solution, most have a population health tool, and
    many have telemedicine offerings. Similarly to Microsoft’s strategy of using its
    Windows and Office customer base to sell Azure cloud services, EHRs are trying
    to sell their own new products. The problem is none of the major EHRs are as savvy,
    either technically or business-wise, as Microsoft.\n\n## The Slow Burn of FHIR\n\nConcurrently,
    many major EHRs are supporting FHIR as a standard way to access EHR data. Some
    of that support may be vaporware, but most EHRs are at least announcing [FHIR
    capabilities](https://datica.com/guide/fhir/). FHIR has been in discussions for
    several years and, despite a lot of broad-based support, is moving painfully slowly
    towards adoption and actual implementation. Yes, the big four may support reading
    data from their EHRs via FHIR, but there is very little a real application can
    do by only reading data from the EHR. At times, the slow pace of FHIR adoption
    seems intentional by the many incumbents supporting it. Despite that, a recent
    survey found that health system CIOs consider FHIR to be the technology with the
    [most promise in 2018](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/interoperability/cios-see-fhir-potential-game-changer-and-blockchain-overhyped-survey),
    meaning FHIR is here to stay.\n\n## Is Replacing EHRs the Path Forward?\n\nIf
    EHRs are failing to support 3rd-party solutions and failing to develop and sell
    their own digital health products fast enough, does that leave option C — replacing
    EHRs — as the only path forward? \n\nNot exactly. \n\nAs both the hub of data
    and hub of clinical workflow, EHRs are extremely entrenched today. The vast majority
    of health system IT department resources are dedicated to supporting EHRs, so
    there are strange incentive conflicts. And, FHIR has been highly effective at
    buying EHRs more time.\n\nAs I said before, this process is not happening overnight,
    but it is happening. More industry leaders are [speaking out against EHRs](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180122/NEWS/180129979)
    and the rampant blocking of innovation so needed in healthcare. EHRs can only
    buy so much time. What I think we are going to see over the next 3-5 years, a
    time that also coincides with when a lot of health systems will have written down
    the heavy upfront capital expense of EHRs, is EHRs becoming less and less a clinical
    workflow tool and more and more a clinical encounter documentation tool and one
    source, not the primary hub, of clinical data.\n\nThere are two parts to that
    prediction. The first just means that we’re going to see purpose-built tools for
    specific workflows. We already see that today with clinical communication tools
    like [Voalte](http://www.voalte.com/) that are making the lives of nurses easier
    by enabling them to use a fast, mobile, purpose-built platform for their workflows
    and communications. The second is piggybacking on the inevitable march toward
    continuous and complete patient data. EHR data today is episodic. Clinical data
    tomorrow will include episodic EHR data but also remote monitoring data, social
    data, genetic data, and always-on sensor data. The EHR data will be one part of
    a much larger puzzle. I think the EHRs of today, the large ones I mention in this
    post, have too much technical debt to move fast enough to serve as the hub of
    clinical data tomorrow. They are saddled with their history.\n\n## 6 Predictions
    about EHRs in 2018\n\nPredictions are easy when you don’t have specific timelines.
    So what do I think we’ll see with EHRs and clinical data in 2018?\n\n1. **More
    direct patient access to EHR data.** There was already a major announcement of
    [Apple enabling its customers to access Epic and Cerner data](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/apple-health-app-effort-to-engage-consumers-by-sharing-ehr-info).\n2.
    **More available production FHIR services.** Most of these will be couched as
    pilots or beta, but progress is progress. FHIR will also be used for direct patient
    access to data.\n3. **Social determinants of health matter…a lot.** Everybody
    always cites studies that show WHO data of high US healthcare spending with resultant
    lousy health outcomes. This is true. And sad. But it’s not the whole story. In
    the US, we spend far less on social programs and services than most countries
    that beat our health outcomes. The result is a health system that doubles as a
    social safety net, with all costs incurred by the health system. Social data and
    care based on that data will be a major shift in 2018, and I think most of that
    will happen outside the EHR, at least regarding data sources and storage.\n4.
    **Demand for data access by EHR customers.** One of the challenges when integrating
    with an EHR is that the default answer is usually “no”. There is invariably friction
    to overcome and it is up to the health system to overcome this friction. I think
    2018 we will see a lot less acceptance of “no” and more pushing for EHRs to open
    up access to data, whether that data is exposed via FHIR or HL7 v2.x or a proprietary
    API middle layer like that provided by Sansoro Health.\n5. **Mega-mergers require
    new strategies around data sharing from unwilling players.** Large-scale mergers
    like Dignity/CHI and Providence-St. Joseph’s/Ascension will show vendors willing
    to demonstrate a more willing ability to play nice so that they don’t lose market
    share as hundreds of hospital sites are brought under one IT umbrella for the
    sake of efficiency. Epic has already shown some cards around this with their [Come
    Together/Happy Together/Working Together](https://www.epic.com/epic/post/3222)
    trio, but it’s hard to say if it’ll stave off mega losses in the usual hospital
    merger shakeup where two EHR vendors enter and only [one leaves](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/advocate-health-care-aurora-healthcare-epic-ehr-merger-care-coordination).\n6.
    **More ambulatory EHR providers bite the dust.** Now that the dust of Meaningful
    Use has settled, more companies are beginning to evaluate if they want to stay
    at the EHR table. With Allscripts acquiring both McKesson’s EHR suite and Practice
    Fusion (at a loss), anticipating more contraction in the EHR space as disinterested
    players try to divest assets while they are still holding water (GE Centricity,
    Greenway) seems like a safe bet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might want

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
