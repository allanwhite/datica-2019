:summary: Datica and Access HealthNet announced a working collaboration this week.
  AHN will be using the Datica Platform to deliver EMR interoperability and security
  to their healthcare bundling platform customers, which will streamline healthcare
  data exchange for hospital and medical billing
:blog_lead: We remain humbled by the wide variety of healthcare customers that reach
  out to us every day. Many of you have come to Datica through recommendations from
  some of our earliest customers, like [Zipnosis](https://www.zipnosis.com/) and [HealthLoop](https://www.healthloop.com/).
  Others of you have heard our company thought leaders, like [Travis Good](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/),
  [Mark Olschesky](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/mark/) and [Kris Gösser](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/kris-gosser/)
  share knowledge about compliance, security, and [digital health success](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/)
  at conferences nationwide. A few have perused our website to learn more about HITRUST,
  Kubernetes and [GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/). While others have learned
  about Datica through the Wisconsin healthcare corridor grapevine.
:post: "\nAt Datica, we especially enjoy partnering with other Wisconsin healthcare
  technology companies. By supporting other Midwest firms with shared knowledge we’ve
  gained over the past five years in business, we ultimately can help accelerate the
  innovation healthcare needs today, while taking immense pride that many of those
  innovations are originating in the Badger State and branching out from coast to
  coast. \n\n## Why customers choose Datica\n\nDatica and [Access HealthNet](https://www.accesshealthnet.com)
  (AHN) announced just such a working collaboration this week. AHN will be using the
  Datica Platform to deliver EMR interoperability and security to their healthcare
  bundling platform customers, which will streamline healthcare data exchange for
  hospital and medical billing.\n \nIn this week’s [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/05/prweb15473825.htm),
  AHN’s Chairman and CEO Eric Haberichter stated that the partnership would exponentially
  propel their company forward. “Our vision of being fully interoperable with all
  major hospital and medical billing systems will become a reality much more rapidly
  with this partnership.”\n \nYes, Datica makes a stellar and flexible platform for
  building healthcare applications in a compliant and secure manner, and we are quite
  proud of that. However, our greatest pride comes when we can point to a new and
  innovative technology, like the one AHN has built, knowing that the Datica Platform
  helped scale such an innovation’s success in healthcare. \n\n## Success squared\n
  \nMariel Margaret Hamm-Garciaparra, also known as former soccer star Mia Hamm, is
  often attributed as saying, “Success breeds success.” At Datica, we think less about
  creation and breeding, and more about containerization, so we instead say, “Success
  builds success.” It’s a small verbal nuance, but it fits well within our box.\n
  \nIn addition to Ms. Hamm’s immense wisdom and skill, she also advised those she
  met to, “Celebrate what you’ve accomplished, but raise the bar a little higher each
  time you succeed.” Daticans take that advice to heart when we help another customer
  accomplish their company goals faster. \n \n### Join the Datica + Kubernetes Webinar
  Tuesday\n\nLearn more about the Datica Platform and how we make Kubernetes secure
  and compliant for healthcare applications by joining our webinar next week, [Kubernetes
  and Healthcare Compliance](https://content.datica.com/kubernetes-datica-2018-05-15),
  Tuesday May 15th at 11:00 AM CDT. \n\n\n"

  :summary: "$360,000! The cost for a maker of digital health products to design,
    implement, deploy and prove HIPAA compliance all on their own. Get the breakdown."
  :blog_lead: "$360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health
    products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their
    own. That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost
    of developing the technology for their own application. We often hear early-stage
    developers say they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using AWS. That’s
    when the steep education process begins to help them understand they’re just at
    the beginning of the compliance journey with AWS and there’s so much more to consider
    to build a compliant application in the cloud. "
  :post: "## The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison \n\nOur
    goal in building the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/) was to reduce
    the barriers to compliance in the cloud for makers of digital health products.
    As part of that ongoing commitment to simplify healthcare's onramp to the cloud,
    we provide as much value as possible in the form of healthcare expertise we share
    freely with the market. It is our goal to enable our customers to focus their
    efforts away from compliance and cloud management and toward developing digital
    health applications that improve patient outcomes. \n\nThere’s much to know about
    both compliance and cloud management and that knowledge requires a significant
    investment in time, education, personnel, and money. The intent of our newest
    guide, [The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/),
    is to help makers of digital health products make informed decisions about whether
    to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in the form of the Datica
    Platform. \n\n***Spoiler Alert:** It’s 10x more cost-effective to contract with
    Datica to deploy your application on a made-for-healthcare platform that includes
    not only the AWS cloud infrastructure, but also all the DevOps, DevSecOps, expertise,
    and proof necessary to build and market a healthcare application.* \n\nThis guide
    explains the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and
    offers a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates
    for each of those considerations. We show how Datica addresses those requirements
    in some detail and how you as a customer benefit from building your application
    on the Datica Platform. These estimates are based on our extensive experience
    working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers
    (like [Amazon Web Services](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/), Microsoft
    Azure, or IBM Softlayer).\n\n## Datica's Shared Responsibility Model\n\nIt’s important
    to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility model grants excellent
    security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible
    for security IN the cloud. Orchestrating DevSecOps is just as challenging as orchestrating
    DevOps. The following diagram explains that a bit more, but get the full story
    by downloading the [complete guide](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/).

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

    As the information protection framework for the healthcare industry, the HITRUST CSF Certification brings a new level of effectiveness and efficiency to third-party assurance. This latest certification provides assurance that we appropriately secure and protect PHI so you can focus on what you do best — building your digital health product in the cloud.

  :summary: Datica customers and innovators Cota, Clockwise.MD, and Arcadia Healthcare
    are making waves in healthcare and we're excited to share their stories.
  :blog_lead: |
    We love sharing the amazing and diverse stories of Datica customers through both [spotlights and case studies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/proof/). Their origin stories, visions on how to change healthcare, and traction are all so compelling, and surprisingly diverse. It reminds us of the vastness of healthcare; the industry is full of things to be fixed, and there is no shortage of innovators ready to step up.

    These three innovators — Cota, Clockwise.MD, and Arcadia Healthcare — the subjects of our most recent customer spotlights, are making waves in healthcare and we're excited to share their stories.
  :post: |
    ## Cota: Fundamentally changing how data informs every healthcare decision

    Three years ago, [Cota](https://www.cotahealthcare.com/), a New York-based digital health company had three employees. Now, the company is using the minds of nearly 100 employees to solve one of the most difficult problems in healthcare — finding a way to provide a universal data model for healthcare to help physicians improve the standards of care. Ultimately, the company seeks to make changes not just to fundamentally change how clinicians use data and make decisions in healthcare, but to accelerate the pace of research in academic networks, and provide real-world evidence to pharmaceutical companies developing cancer-fighting treatments. As the company works to solve this challenge, it is producing a significant amount of research in the field and has been published in 15 peer-reviewed journals and delivered presentations at multiple industry conferences.

    > [Read the rest](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/cota/#spotlight) of the Cota Spotlight to learn how Cota turned patient data into useable insights at scale, and their plans to expand beyond oncology.

    ## Clockwise.MD: Improving patient satisfaction with timing technology

    Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot, UPS — those are likely the business names that first come to mind when one mentions Atlanta. Yet, entrepreneurs and innovators are now the talk of the town with their kudzu-like startup growth. In 2013, startup Founder Michael Burke launched [Clockwise.MD](https://www.clockwisemd.com/) at the [Atlanta Tech Village (ATV)](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), with help from co-founders Phillip Han and Phong Si. ATV is a wonderful mix between incubator/accelerator and coworking space where roughly 225 other startups work to build their companies. At that time, Atlanta also had nine of the nation’s top health IT companies, which put it on track to become one of the top five US tech hub cities.

    Now relocated across the street from Georgia Tech, Clockwise.MD taps technology talent from the university to expand and improve its online scheduling and wait time transparency solutions for healthcare organizations. Recognized in 2016 as a Best Place to Work in Atlanta and a Healthcare Hero by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the co-founders at Clockwise.MD have nailed down a healthcare solution that hit at the right time and in the right place.

    > [Continue reading](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/clockwisemd/#spotlight) to learn what Michael Burke and his co-founders learned about patient experience, and about being in the right place at the right time.

    ## Arcadia Healthcare Solutions: Bringing value-based performance management to the healthcare organizations changing the industry

    Of healthcare’s structural problems, connecting data in the absence of sufficient standards looms large. By stepping in to fill the gap as a trusted connector, Boston-based [Arcadia Healthcare Solutions](http://www.arcadiasolutions.com/) is a leader at solving the massive data problems in healthcare that prevent both big and small organizations from having a meaningful impact.

    Arcadia was founded in 2002 as a consulting firm primarily focused on insurers. Their specialty was systems integration throughout their first five years of existence.

    Eventually in 2008 they started working on more tooling for a mix of health systems, independent provider groups and health plans, which lead to version 1.0 of the Arcadia Analytics platform. They built a deep expertise in [Electronic Health Record (EHR) and claims data integration](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/ehr-integrations/) and supporting technology. That led to a conscious pivot in 2012 to a technology-first, SaaS-based analytics company.

    And they haven’t looked back since. Arcadia augmented their analytics technology strengths with two acquisitions in 2011 and 2015 to build EHR infrastructure and managed care capabilities. Arcadia now connects 18 of the top 20 EHR platforms, have hundreds of live connections updated nightly, and work with premier health systems, health plans, and accountable care organizations across the country.
