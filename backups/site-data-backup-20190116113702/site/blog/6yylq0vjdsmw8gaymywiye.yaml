:blog_lead: 'Two recent talks have shed light on what people in the healthcare information
  technology sector might expect from the current administration. The first was a
  speech by Alex Azar at the Federation of American Hospitals recent meeting about
  value-based care, and the second, given by Seema Verna at HIMSS18, emphasized the
  need for interoperability among EHRs. Together, these talks make it clear that the
  current administration wants to give consumers access to their health data. But,
  how will this happen?

'
:post: "\n## Alex Azar promotes value-based care to FAH\n\nThe first, given by Health
  and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to the Federation of American Hospitals on
  March 5, offered a four-point plan to move to a value-based care system faster.
  He noted that even taking recent advances in areas such as personalized medicine
  and cell therapies, the US healthcare system doesn’t deliver results to match costs.
  \n\nHis four points included: \n\n1. Patients, rather than providers, should have
  ownership of health records. \n2. Costs should be transparent. \n3. Medicare and
  Medicaid will be used to drive change in the industry.\n4. Regulations that slow
  progress toward value-based care will be reduced. \n\n## Seema Verma announces initiative
  at HIMSS18\n\nThe second, given the following day, March 6, by the current Administrator
  at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), Seema Verma at Healthcare Information
  and Management Systems Society’s 2018 meeting (HIMSS18), emphasized the need for
  interoperability among electronic health record (EHR) systems. \n\nVerma announced
  a new initiative related to Azar’s first point. It is called the MyHealthEData initiative,
  and it is designed to give individuals access to their own health records. The announcement
  about MyHealthEData was published on the CMS website during Verma’s speech. \n\n“MyHealthEData
  will help twork to make clear that patients deserve to not only electronically receive
  a copy of their entire health record, but also be able to share their data with
  whomever they want, making the patient the center of the healthcare system,” read
  [the announcement.](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-items/2018-03-06.html)\n\n##
  The free flow of information\n\nAt least two factors are likely to inhibit the MyHealthEData
  initiative: the lack of interoperability among EHRs and the practice of data blocking.
  Verma addressed both in her HIMSS18 remarks. \n\nOne way CMS plans to address the
  barriers to the free flow of information is by overhauling the Meaningful Use program.
  “Our new direction will not only reduce time and costs, but will also be laser focused
  on increased interoperability and giving patients access to their data across all
  of our programs,” Verma said in her speech.\n\nAdditionally, data-blocking will
  be met with “a more aggressive stance” from CMS. “It is not acceptable to limit
  patient records or to prevent them and their doctor from seeing their complete history
  outside of a particular healthcare system,” Verma said. \n\n## What does it all
  mean? \n\nTaken together, these two speeches make it clear that the current administration
  wants to make sure consumers have access to their own healthcare records. However,
  that sentiment begs the question: What will consumers do with that information?
  \n\n“There is an entire level here involving not just data and information, but
  how the purchasers, payers, providers, and consumers of healthcare interact, and
  might interact going into the future -- including with regard to sharing data and
  information among themselves to make business decisions affecting healthcare consumers,”
  says Mark Hagland of Healthcare Informatics in an [article analyzing the potential
  impact of the two speeches.](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/blogs/mark-hagland/payment/cms-makes-big-splash-verma-s-speech-what-does-it-really-mean?page=3)
  \n\nDevelopers and programmers may play an important role in how consumers use their
  information. Apps that help patients understand and use their health data are likely
  to play a critical role, as are apps that help to transmit and streamline data.
  \n\nVerma said that patients will receive copies of their EHRs electronically, and
  that the process will happen through application programming interfaces, or APIs.
  “CMS believes the future of healthcare depends on the development of open APIs,”
  said Verma, adding that CMS will function as a convener of APIs across the digital
  system. \n\n"

  :summary: 'Travis Good, MD, Co-founder, CEO & Chief Privacy Officer of Datica and
    9-time HIMSS attendee shares his advice to surviving and staying sane at HIMSS18. '
  :blog_lead: |
    HIMSS is my most exhausting week of the year. I think this is my 9th HIMSS. Today, with 40,000+ attendees, it’s a logistical nightmare from start to finish. Everything from transportation to coffee is a challenge. Events go late into the night, and I always seem to have an early coffee or breakfast meeting, so sleep isn’t plentiful. I’m not sure if I prefer Las Vegas to Orlando as the location for HIMSS. Both have pros and cons.

    Below is my personal HIMSS survival guide. Hopefully, I can remember these things and keep my sanity next week.
  :post: "\n## Be patient\n\nWhen you cram 40,000+ people into any location, even
    a behemoth Las Vegas hotel and conference center like the Venetian, the trains
    rarely run on time. Getting a car. Getting to a booth. Getting coffee. They all
    take way longer than you would expect. It can rattle you if you’re used to things
    running on a schedule. I’ll give HIMSS credit in that sessions usually do stick
    to their assigned time slots. It’s everything else that gets off the rails. The
    best advice is to relax and be patient. You’ll get that car or coffee eventually,
    and there’s precious little you can do to make it any better. Embrace the chaos
    and enjoy the spectacle of HIT’s annual Lollapalooza.\n\n## Get out of the Venetian\n\nIf
    you don’t have to be at the Venetian for an event at a set place (including booth
    time), go somewhere else. I’ve probably been to conferences at the Venetian 5-6
    times, and it still confuses me how to get around. It’s vast so getting out is
    a commitment and likely something you’ll want to do at the start (breakfast) or
    end of the day. Getting out of the Venetian helps me to maintain my sanity and
    remember there is a real world out there where every conversation you hear isn't
    about Epic or [FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir/) or population health. The
    one caveat to this is if you’re dead set on mingling and trying to network in
    the hopes that you hit it off with the anonymous person you meet at the Venetian
    \n\n## Avoid the main entrances\n\nAs I wrote above, the Venetian is large, and
    the bowels are confusing to navigate. If you can find a way to avoid the main
    ways in or out, you’ll find shorter coffee and drink lines. The worst times for
    the main arteries into the Venetian are, not surprisingly, around the conference
    schedules. Attendees tend to follow schedules, especially for exhibit hall opening
    times and keynotes. If you can, you’re better off going early or late to avoid
    the rush.\n\n## Buffer your time\n\nI’d estimate less than 25% of my scheduled
    HIMSS meetings, not sessions, start on time. The exhibit hall is massive, so people
    always underestimate how long they need between meetings. The good part is, everybody
    at HIMSS knows that HIMSS is challenging so most people expect a certain portion
    of meetings to start late, get rescheduled, or to not start at all.\n\n## Bring
    a battery backup\n\nThe bowels of the Venetian, deep in the exhibit hall and session
    rooms, have spotty mobile coverage. Couple that with the hordes of people sharing
    the mobile networks and your phone will eat a lot of battery establishing and
    re-establishing connections. Wall outlets are popular to combat this. Having a
    battery backup is super convenient if you want your phone to be on all day.\n\n##
    Bring good shoes\n\nI usually average 15-20k steps a day at HIMSS. I don’t attend
    many sessions, so I’m on my feet pretty much all day. Comfortable shoes help make
    this a lot more pleasant.\n\n## Take notes\n\nI used to take notes religiously
    when I wrote for [HIStalk](https://histalk2.com) because I’d write up daily summaries
    of the conference each night. As an aside, the people at HIStalk deserve a ton
    of credit for reporting on HIMSS; it’s a herculean task and makes me feel bad
    about my HIMSS whining in this post. I still write notes today, and if you see
    me next week, I’ll have my notebook with me. I take notes on people I meet and
    market intelligence related to Datica. There’s a lot to see and take in at HIMSS,
    too much for me to remember without notes.\n\n## Get some swag\n\nI usually try
    to get things for my kids and my wife to reduce my guilt from being away. One
    of my favorites was touchscreen gloves from [Imprivata](https://www.imprivata.com).
    I also try to get as many stuffed fish as I can from [PilotFish](https://www.pilotfishtechnology.com),
    though they’ve made it harder each year to get multiple fish. Every year there
    is new and exciting stuff to be had in the HIMSS exhibit hall. Not objective,
    but if you want the best swag in 2018, stop by the Datica booth (booth 5077) and
    check out our [Yeti](https://www.yeti.com) cups.\n\n## Balance your caffeine intake\n\nHIMSS
    is like [coffee-obsessed Seattle](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/food/coffee-culture-seattle)
    to me in that I always feel over-caffeinated by late morning or early afternoon.
    When this happens, especially if I’m not hydrating, I feel pretty crappy. My goal
    this year is to limit my caffeine intake for 2-3 cups a day, which isn't too far
    off from my normal caffeine schedule. The Datica booth is going to be stocked
    with cold brew coffee for our team and those that stop by (booth 5077) so I’m
    hopeful my willpower overcomes the ease of caffeine access next week.\n\n## Keep
    smiling\n\nI have a lot of friends in HIT and enjoy running into people at HIMSS.
    It’s the one event each year where I get a chance to bump into specific people.
    As exhausting as the week is, it’s only really four days (M-Th) so smile and get
    through it.\n\n\nI hope to see you at HIMSS! Look for me at the Datica booth,
    #5077, or on Tuesday, March 6th at 11:00am in the Amazon Booth, #1625, for a talk
    I'm giving about HITRUST on AWS. \n\n\n\n\n"

  :blog_lead: |-
    HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

    AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
  :post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
    healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time
    again.\n\nInnovative health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying
    to adopt AWS:\n\n1. **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push
    projects to internally owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving
    to the cloud, those initiatives can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the
    DevOps and cloud engineering resources needed outside of their control.\n\n2.
    **Internal Compliance does not approve of the low levels of liability taken on
    by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/),
    roughly 1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical
    level and firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's
    responsibility. Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned
    with Internal Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector.
    While AWS themselves have some of the best infrastructure security measures in
    the world, the operating system level is still the responsibility now of the organization
    to secure. That's a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem
    requiring hard-to-find resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll
    combined, most healthcare enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas,
    Corporate Director of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur,
    articulated this exact pain while giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe
    width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0\"
    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n##
    Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST
    has been a godsend.\n\nFor three years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified
    on top of AWS. Our Platform absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the
    cloud, which extends AWS's excellent coverage for compliance **of** the cloud.
    \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
    enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
    internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
    projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
    the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
    \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
    Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and
    compliance in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe
    result is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are
    making a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n##
    Live presentation for those who can't make it at HIMSS\n\nIf you are not attending
    HIMSS this year, or if you are unable to make the 11:00 am time slot on Tuesday,
    March 6th, we are holding a 30-minute webinar later in March to expand on Travis'
    presentation. Please join us if you can't visit us in person at HIMSS.\n\n[Visit
    our webinar overview to register for the March 21st presentation at 12:00 pm CST.](https://content.datica.com/hitrust-on-aws-2018-03-21)\n\nWhile
    you’re at HIMSS make sure to also visit the Datica booth, #5077. See you at HIMSS!\n\n\n"

    CEO of Datica, offers a deep look at what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. '
  :blog_lead: "Sadly, the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH
    and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health
    record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who
    support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have
    delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the
    outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are
    here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and,
    by extension, patients.\n\nIn this third part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. "
  :post: "\nToday, EHRs are in use by [95+% of eligible providers](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Hospital-Progress-to-Meaningful-Use-by-size-practice-setting-area-type.php).
    With that massive adoption, EHRs, at least the meaningful use certified EHRs deemed
    by the government worthy of carrot and stick adoption incentives, play two foundational
    roles in healthcare today.\n\n1. **EHRs are the hub of patient data.** They collect
    and store both subjective information and objective data from devices. They store
    reports and other kinds of file attachments. They store discrete data.\n2. **EHRs
    are the hub of clinical workflow.** Though EHRs are designed for general workflows,
    they don’t provide the tailored fit clinicians actually need forcing them to have
    to adapt their workflows to EHRs and not the other way around as it should be.
    Orders, messages, referrals, you name it. If providers are not entering or looking
    for data in the EHR, they are using the EHR to accomplish a task.\n\nThese two
    roles are foundational to building solutions, technology, or technology-enabled
    processes on top of the EHR; there are exceptions to this rule but, increasingly,
    even these exceptions are being forced to integrate. This changes everything,
    especially for those innovators in healthcare that are trying to develop solutions
    for providers and patients. But, almost as importantly, it forces EHRs to now
    either a) build new solutions themselves, b) support new 3rd party solutions,
    or c) risk replacement by newer EHRs that do either a or b. This process isn’t
    happening overnight, but it is happening.\n\nHealthcare technology tends to cycle
    every 15 years or so between best-of-breed solutions and all-in-one platforms.
    Today’s EHRs are at the tail end of a 15-year cycle that has seen their adoption
    grow massively as healthcare providers have implemented one of a few EHR options
    as platforms. Now, we are starting to cycle back to best-of-breed solutions as
    it has become abundantly clear that monolithic EHRs cannot develop solutions fast
    enough to meet the demands of the market. One platform cannot do everything. And
    EHRs, at least the major ones, are trying a mix of the a and b strategy above
    to hold their place as the central healthcare IT software.\n\n## EHRs still control
    access to patient data\n\nEHRs still control access to data and clinician workflows
    and have used that control to slow down adoption of new digital health solutions.
    EHRs have developed proprietary programs, or app stores/orchards/ programs, in
    attempts to support, whether that support is real or perceived, 3rd party solutions
    — Epic has App Orchard, Cerner has Cerner Cares, Allscripts has the Allscripts
    Developer Program, and Athena has More Disruption Please (there are more examples,
    but these are the big four). While programs from Athena and Allscripts are mature
    at this point, the emerging programs from Epic and Cerner have been slow to take
    off at best or failing at achieving any meaningful adoption at worst. The reasons
    for their slow take off or failure are partially technology-related (the app stores
    are proprietary) and partially business-model related (Apple can take 30% of app
    store partner revenue because Apple is the primary driver of revenue whereas EHRs
    are trying to collect 30% of revenue as a tax merely to integrate with them.)
    The $15-20K EHR integration price tag we grew to loathe is now a 30% tax on partner
    revenue.\n\nAt the same time EHRs try to support 3rd party applications, they
    are trying to build their own solutions to shut out digital health products. Every
    EHR now has a data warehousing solution, most have a population health tool, and
    many have telemedicine offerings. Similarly to Microsoft’s strategy of using its
    Windows and Office customer base to sell Azure cloud services, EHRs are trying
    to sell their own new products. The problem is none of the major EHRs are as savvy,
    either technically or business-wise, as Microsoft.\n\n## The Slow Burn of FHIR\n\nConcurrently,
    many major EHRs are supporting FHIR as a standard way to access EHR data. Some
    of that support may be vaporware, but most EHRs are at least announcing [FHIR
    capabilities](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir/). FHIR has been in discussions for
    several years and, despite a lot of broad-based support, is moving painfully slowly
    towards adoption and actual implementation. Yes, the big four may support reading
    data from their EHRs via FHIR, but there is very little a real application can
    do by only reading data from the EHR. At times, the slow pace of FHIR adoption
    seems intentional by the many incumbents supporting it. Despite that, a recent
    survey found that health system CIOs consider FHIR to be the technology with the
    [most promise in 2018](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/interoperability/cios-see-fhir-potential-game-changer-and-blockchain-overhyped-survey),
    meaning FHIR is here to stay.\n\n## Is Replacing EHRs the Path Forward?\n\nIf
    EHRs are failing to support 3rd-party solutions and failing to develop and sell
    their own digital health products fast enough, does that leave option C — replacing
    EHRs — as the only path forward? \n\nNot exactly. \n\nAs both the hub of data
    and hub of clinical workflow, EHRs are extremely entrenched today. The vast majority
    of health system IT department resources are dedicated to supporting EHRs, so
    there are strange incentive conflicts. And, FHIR has been highly effective at
    buying EHRs more time.\n\nAs I said before, this process is not happening overnight,
    but it is happening. More industry leaders are [speaking out against EHRs](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180122/NEWS/180129979)
    and the rampant blocking of innovation so needed in healthcare. EHRs can only
    buy so much time. What I think we are going to see over the next 3-5 years, a
    time that also coincides with when a lot of health systems will have written down
    the heavy upfront capital expense of EHRs, is EHRs becoming less and less a clinical
    workflow tool and more and more a clinical encounter documentation tool and one
    source, not the primary hub, of clinical data.\n\nThere are two parts to that
    prediction. The first just means that we’re going to see purpose-built tools for
    specific workflows. We already see that today with clinical communication tools
    like [Voalte](http://www.voalte.com/) that are making the lives of nurses easier
    by enabling them to use a fast, mobile, purpose-built platform for their workflows
    and communications. The second is piggybacking on the inevitable march toward
    continuous and complete patient data. EHR data today is episodic. Clinical data
    tomorrow will include episodic EHR data but also remote monitoring data, social
    data, genetic data, and always-on sensor data. The EHR data will be one part of
    a much larger puzzle. I think the EHRs of today, the large ones I mention in this
    post, have too much technical debt to move fast enough to serve as the hub of
    clinical data tomorrow. They are saddled with their history.\n\n## 6 Predictions
    about EHRs in 2018\n\nPredictions are easy when you don’t have specific timelines.
    So what do I think we’ll see with EHRs and clinical data in 2018?\n\n1. **More
    direct patient access to EHR data.** There was already a major announcement of
    [Apple enabling its customers to access Epic and Cerner data](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/apple-health-app-effort-to-engage-consumers-by-sharing-ehr-info).\n2.
    **More available production FHIR services.** Most of these will be couched as
    pilots or beta, but progress is progress. FHIR will also be used for direct patient
    access to data.\n3. **Social determinants of health matter…a lot.** Everybody
    always cites studies that show WHO data of high US healthcare spending with resultant
    lousy health outcomes. This is true. And sad. But it’s not the whole story. In
    the US, we spend far less on social programs and services than most countries
    that beat our health outcomes. The result is a health system that doubles as a
    social safety net, with all costs incurred by the health system. Social data and
    care based on that data will be a major shift in 2018, and I think most of that
    will happen outside the EHR, at least regarding data sources and storage.\n4.
    **Demand for data access by EHR customers.** One of the challenges when integrating
    with an EHR is that the default answer is usually “no”. There is invariably friction
    to overcome and it is up to the health system to overcome this friction. I think
    2018 we will see a lot less acceptance of “no” and more pushing for EHRs to open
    up access to data, whether that data is exposed via FHIR or HL7 v2.x or a proprietary
    API middle layer like that provided by Sansoro Health.\n5. **Mega-mergers require
    new strategies around data sharing from unwilling players.** Large-scale mergers
    like Dignity/CHI and Providence-St. Joseph’s/Ascension will show vendors willing
    to demonstrate a more willing ability to play nice so that they don’t lose market
    share as hundreds of hospital sites are brought under one IT umbrella for the
    sake of efficiency. Epic has already shown some cards around this with their [Come
    Together/Happy Together/Working Together](https://www.epic.com/epic/post/3222)
    trio, but it’s hard to say if it’ll stave off mega losses in the usual hospital
    merger shakeup where two EHR vendors enter and only [one leaves](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/advocate-health-care-aurora-healthcare-epic-ehr-merger-care-coordination).\n6.
    **More ambulatory EHR providers bite the dust.** Now that the dust of Meaningful
    Use has settled, more companies are beginning to evaluate if they want to stay
    at the EHR table. With Allscripts acquiring both McKesson’s EHR suite and Practice
    Fusion (at a loss), anticipating more contraction in the EHR space as disinterested
    players try to divest assets while they are still holding water (GE Centricity,
    Greenway) seems like a safe bet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might want

  :summary: 'The January, 2018 draft of the Trusted Exchange Framework is the first
    real step toward interoperability since the Cures Act was passed. '
  :blog_lead: 'One of the biggest obstacles to using electronic health data to the
    fullest potential is the lack of interoperability. At every level of healthcare,
    the lack of interoperability causes problems: patients cannot easily access their
    own health data, providers have problems accessing the health information of new
    patients, researchers cannot access the data necessary to identify trends that
    would improve population health, and technology companies struggle to compete
    in a closed marketplace. '
  :post: "The [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text),
    sometimes referred to as the Cures Act, which was passed in December 2016, identifies
    the need for interoperability. Interoperability would make the exchange of personal
    health information (PHI) possible while still maintaining security. Currently,
    information is siloed within EHR systems, and [data integration with those EHRs](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/integration/)
    is frequently cited issue for healthcare providers. \n\nAlongside the need for
    various stakeholders to be able to access information, there is the requirement
    to follow the dictates of the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-101-a-primer/). Information needs
    to be accessible, but must also remain secure. Through the Cures Act, Congress
    instructed the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to create or support the
    creation of a framework for health information networks (HINs) to exchange health
    information through a common agreement. \n\n## What is The Trusted Exchange Framework?\n\nThe
    draft Trusted Exchange Framework is the first step toward interoperability. The
    ONC has published a [User’s Guide to Understanding the Draft Trusted Exchange
    Framework](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-guide.pdf). The
    document was released on January 5, 2018, and consists of two parts:\n\nPart A
    - Principles for Trusted Exchange\nPart B - Minimum Required Terms and Conditions
    for Trusted Exchange\n\nStakeholders are [encouraged to submit comments](https://beta.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement)
    through February 20, 2018. Once comments have been submitted and a final version
    agreed upon, the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) will
    be published in the Federal Register. The ONC expects the final version to be
    published by late 2018. \n\nThe stakeholders include: \n\n* Health information
    networks\n* Federal agencies\n* Public health organizations\n* Individuals\n*
    Payers\n* Providers\n* Technology developers\n\nOne of the most important goals
    of the Trusted Exchange Framework is to create what the ONC describes as “a single
    on-ramp” to interoperability. Currently, healthcare organizations use different
    point-to-point interfaces to exchange PHI with each other. This system requires
    the creation and maintenance of all those individual interfaces, which is expensive
    and inefficient. \n\nCreating one framework for various stakeholders to exchange
    information will simplify the process, make accessing their own PHI easier for
    patients, and create a more competitive market for technology companies. \n\n##
    Two Parts of the Trusted Exchange Framework\n\n### Trusted Exchange Framework
    Part A\n\nThe first part of the Framework is Principles for Trusted Exchange.
    The ONC has defined six principles: \n1. Standardization\n2. Transparency\n3.
    Cooperation and Non-Discrimination\n4. Security and Patient Safety\n5. Access\n6.
    Data-Driven Accountability \n\nThese general principles are described as “guardrails,”
    and the goal of Part A is to build trust among the various HINs. \n\n### Trusted
    Exchange Framework Part B\n\nThe second part of the framework is Minimum Required
    Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. This section creates common practices
    for the exchange of health information, including a common authentication process,
    rules for exchange, and organizational and operational practices. \n\nSpeaking
    to [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/onc-genevieve-morris-trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-interoperability),
    Genevieve Morris, the principal deputy national coordinator for health information
    technology at the ONC said, \n\n> This is just the floor of what those required
    terms and conditions are. We all just have to agree to the same terms in order
    for that exchange to happen.” \n\n## Building on the 3 Goals of Interoperability\n\nThe
    Trusted Exchange Framework builds on the work that the industry has already done
    to advance interoperability. [A press release](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/01/05/draft-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-released-hhs.html)
    from the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the draft stresses
    that there are three important goals of interoperability: \n\n1. Patient access
    - patients should be able to easily access their own health information.\n2. Population-level
    data exchange - both providers and payers need access to population-level health
    data in order to analyze trends, outcomes, and costs.\n3. Open and accessible
    APIs - giving the health IT community access to health information will improve
    the entrepreneurial climate, leading to innovation and improved usability. \n\nThe
    ONC will outsource the actual implementation of the framework. The ONC will hold
    an “open and competitive selection of a single Recognized Exchange Framework Entity
    (RCE) from the industry,” wrote Morris in a [blog post on HealthIT Buzz](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-common-agreement-common-sense-approach-achieving-health-information-interoperability/).
    \ \n\nThe RCE will work with the ONC to develop the final version of the TEFCA
    that is published in the Federal Register. \n"

    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
