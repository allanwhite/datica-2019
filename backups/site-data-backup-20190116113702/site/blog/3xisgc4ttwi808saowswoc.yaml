:summary: A recent data breach at the University of Virginia Health System exposed
  PHI for 18 months! We explore the facts and how this could have been prevented.
:blog_lead: "Often, the public learns about breaches of personal health information
  (PHI) because of the number of people affected. In fact organizations are required
  to [inform the media of breaches](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html)
  that affect 500 or more people, so the number of people involved is a critical component
  of data breach reports.\n\nHowever, a recent data breach at the University of Virginia
  Health System is interesting for a different reason: the length of time that PHI
  was exposed. The breach was discovered on December 23, 2016, and reported appropriately.
  The hacker had first gained access to the system, and the information of 1,882 patients’
  records, on May 23, 2015, meaning the PHI was exposed for 18 months. \n"
:post: "\n## The Fruitfly malware attack\n\nThe hacker, Phillip Durachinsky, accessed
  the information through a physician’s laptop. Durachinsky developed malware called
  Fruitfly, and when it was installed he was able to view from a remote location whatever
  the person with the computer was looking at. Because the physician could access
  patient records, Durachinsky also had access to them. \n\nMark Olschesky, chief
  data officer at Datica wrote an article addressing some of the [largest data breaches
  of 2017](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
  In it, he notes, “While it’s impossible to say in retrospect if any breach was 100%
  preventable, having policies in place to provide ‘reasonable effort’ to prevent
  exposure is key to minimizing the damage from the unpreventable.” Malware was the
  cause of multiple breaches in 2017. \n\nOfficials at UVA became aware of the breach
  because the FBI was investigating Durachinsky, who had used Fruitfly to access computers
  owned by local, state, and federal government agencies, various companies, individuals,
  a police department, and schools in addition to UVA. He had been using the malware
  since 2003. \n\nIn a [press release](https://uvahealth.com/privacy-notice-for-uva-health-system-patients),
  UVA says, “The FBI has advised us that the third party, who has been arrested, did
  not take, use or share patients’ information in any way.” In addition to cooperating
  fully with the FBI investigation UVA followed HIPAA protocol in notifying the affected
  patients, the media, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The organization
  set up a call center to handle patient questions about the breach. \n\nIn this case,
  it appears the hacker did not use the PHI for nefarious purposes, however, the fact
  that the information was exposed for so long raises some serious questions. Was
  there anything that UVA officials could have done to learn about the breach sooner?
  Would security reviews or checks have revealed the malware? Were there any abnormalities
  that should have alerted the physician or the IT team of the malware? \n\nDatica
  can answer some of those questions. Patch management, policies on appropriate system
  access, and OSSEC and anti-virus intrusion detection on all systems to identify
  attacks that would be otherwise unknown are all methods that Datica uses in an effort
  to avert attacks such as the one at UVA. Datica’s [open-source policies](https://policy.datica.com/#1-introduction)
  are designed to address numerous types of attacks, including malware. \n\nThough
  it ended well for the 1,882 patients since there was no nefarious use or disclosure
  of their data, it didn't end so well for Durachinsky. The Cavalier Daily, the independent
  daily news organization at the [University of Virginia reports](http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2018/02/records-of-1882-uva-patients-impacted-by-security-breach),
  “Durachinsky was indicted Jan. 10 in the United States District Court for the Northern
  District of Ohio on allegations of accessing and damaging protected computers, production
  of child pornography, aggravated identity theft and illegal wiretap.” \n\n\n\n"

  :summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of
    band authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is
    responding.
  :blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
    kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
    attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from
    White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent
    one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
    more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
    ourselves.
  :post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
    and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
    organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization
    is immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the
    widespread issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of
    Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update,
    specifically [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html),
    includes important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods
    versus a single source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
    is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
    and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
    makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity
    proofing\n \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates
    out identity authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and
    authentication proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have
    the proper credentials to access a file, server, or other data containing device
    or software,” explained Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole
    question is: How do we prove John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance
    is important to Datica customers who live and breathe in an environment awash
    with protected health information. More and more the healthcare industry is affected
    by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
    that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
    ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high
    price on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n
    \nThis clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because
    that will change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an
    organization, a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the
    victim’s accounts.\n \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n
    \nThe engineering team is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to
    disallow email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to
    the problem of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
    risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected
    health information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach
    to helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
    chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why
    Datica developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    platform initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become
    HITRUST CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security
    and compliance a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica
    at hello@datica.com to arrange a quick chat about your needs and to learn more
    about how the Datica Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

  :summary: 'One thing is certain: healthcare still has a security problem. Out of
    295 breaches reported so far for 2017, 132 are hacking/IT incident breaches.'
  :blog_lead: "The US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil
    Rights (OCR) investigates reports of data breaches involving health information.
    The breach reports are publicly available and searchable with a tool called the
    [HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/07/25/hhs-unveils-improved-web-tool-highlight-recent-breaches-health-information.html
    ). \n\nBecause entities have 60 days beyond the date a breach occurs to report
    it, complete results for 2017 will not be available until March 2018. However,
    a look at what has been reported so far, along with any general trends, may be
    instructive as we all prepare for the more stringent [penalties of GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)
    coming in May of 2018. "
  :post: "## HIPAA Security is still a problem\n\nOne thing is certain: healthcare
    [still has a security problem](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/).
    The majority of the breaches in 2017 are classified as being the result of hacking/IT
    incidents. Out of 295 breaches reported between January 1, 2017 and December 31,
    2017, 132 are listed as hacking/IT incident breaches. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/I6lTKaUWA0saAwMcgAQiq/2e887136b5a32a26530fdd528bcb004f/data-breach-2017.jpg\"
    alt=\"2017 Data Breaches by Type\">\n\nOne of the largest, which occurred at Airway
    Oxygen, Inc., and affected 500,000 people was due to hacking of information in
    a network server. The company was hit by a ransomware attack in April, 2017, and
    reported the breach to HHS in June. \n\nAccording to [a story about the Airway
    Oxygen breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/500000-affected-ransomware-attack-home-medical-equipment-supplier)
    in Healthcare IT News, after the attack was discovered, Airway Oxygen “performed
    an internal scan on its system, changed all passwords for all users, vendors and
    applications, reviewed the firewall, updated and deployed security tools and installed
    monitoring software to issue alerts of suspicious activity.” They also hired a
    cybersecurity firm to help them understand how the breach occurred and its impact.
    \n\nThe story of Airway Oxygen’s breach begs the question: if they had taken all
    of those security measures before the breach, would it have happened? There’s
    no way of knowing, of course, but it certainly is a question worth asking. \n\n##
    Many types of entities are at risk, not only healthcare providers\n\nAnother interesting
    thing about the reports for 2017 so far is that all different sorts of entities
    reported breaches. It’s not only health systems or practices that have suffered
    security woes; insurers, state departments of human services, software companies,
    and other types of covered entities and business associates have reported breaches
    as well. \n\nLate in 2016 and continuing into early in 2017, [MongoDB databases
    fell victim to ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2017/01/secure-mongodb-database.html)
    attacks. The Hacker News reports, “These MongoDB instances weren’t exposed due
    to any flaw in its software, but due to a misconfiguration (bad security practice)
    that let any remote attacker access MongoDB databases without using any special
    hacking tool.” \n\nMongoDB corrected the problem in the next version of its software,
    but that requires administrators to actually update their servers. In September
    2017, as many as 26,000 [databases were hijacked and held for ransom](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-are-ransoming-26000-unsecured-mongodb-databases-security-researchers-find).
    Emory Brain Health Center and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center were caught up in
    the attacks, along with other entities. \n\n## Lessons from others’ mistakes\n\nOn
    December 28, 2017, the OCR announced a settlement for a breach. The entity, 21st
    Century Oncology (21CO), was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations
    (FBI) twice in 2015 and informed that patients’ personal health information (PHI)
    was being obtained illegally by unauthorized individuals. \n\nThe FBI found that
    the breach was occurring through a remote desktop protocol from an exchange server.
    As many as 2.2 million people were affected. \n\nThe settlement was for 21CO to
    pay $2.3 million and to enter into a corrective action plan (CAP). According to
    an article published by the law firm Saul Ewing Arstein & Lehr LLP,\nthe results
    of the OCR’s investigation in this instance offer insight into [what all healthcare
    entities should be doing](https://www.saul.com/publications/alerts/2017-closes-2-million-hipaa-settlement):
    \n\n> The OCR’s investigation determined that 21CO (i) failed to conduct an accurate
    and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability of its electronic protected health information (ePHI);
    (ii) failed to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and
    vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level; (iii) failed to implement
    procedures to regularly review records of its information system activity; and,
    (iv) disclosed PHI to third party vendors who were acting as business associate
    without having written business associate agreement in place.” \n\nThe CAP that
    21CO agreed to includes completing a risk analysis and risk management plan, revising
    security policies and procedures, and cataloging its business associate agreements,
    among several other steps. \n\nSaul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr offer advice to other
    business required to comply with HIPAA regulations, writing, \n\n> As we begin
    2018, covered entities and business associates should revisit their HIPAA Privacy,
    Security and Breach Notification policies and procedures to ensure internal compliance
    and make timely adjustments as appropriate.” \n\nAs we move through 2018 and toward
    May, when the new GDPR EU data privacy regulations becomes effective, it behooves
    us all to pay close attention to how much we are at risk of a data breach—not
    only with HIPAA, but also [with GDPR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/gdpr/). After
    all, that $2.1 million 21CO HIPAA penalty could potentially be ten times that
    amount in GDPR fines.\n\nLet Datica remove the burden and risk of compliance for
    your digital health application with our HITRUST-certified healthcare platform.

  :post: "## Ransomware or Malware\n\nAt top of mind in 2017 is ransomware and malware,
    which shut down and exposed multiple hospitals and HIT Vendors thoughout the year.
    Of those, two were notable:\n\n-  [Pacific Alliance Medical Center attack potentially
    leaks 260K patients](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/los-angeles-provider-breached-ransomware-attack-over-260000-patients-affected-updated)\n-
    \ [Nuance Impacted for Weeks Due to Malware](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/cybersecurity/cyber-attack-update-nuance-still-down-researchers-believe-petya-not)\n\nThe
    vector of the attack is relatively straightforward: through phishing or infected
    3rd party hardware like a thumb drive, hackers gain access to hardware throughout
    an organization's network and encrypt data on that hardware. The purpose of ransomware
    is to extract payment to undo that encryption while other malware like the ones
    believed to be used in the Nuance attack are wholly irreversible and are just
    designed to effectively destroy the data.\n\nPreventing something like an attack
    like this actually hits to the heart of most of our policies, but let's go for
    the top 3 references in this article. First, [patch management](https://policy.datica.com/#9.5-patch-management-procedures)
    ensures that you are constantly being vigilant to new security concerns. While
    it's not directly stated in our policies, we have one person and a backup who
    are wholly responsible for managing patches for our system for security concerns.
    Second, having policies on [appropriate system access and by reducing the need
    for privledged users](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification)
    reduces the risk that if one user's credentials are compromised all systems could
    be accessible by an attacker. Third, we run [OSSEC and Anti-Virus](https://policy.datica.com/#17.4-prevention-of-malware-on-production-systems)
    on all production systems to identify any otherwise unknown attacks and to solve
    any issues brought up from an attack.\n\n## Unauthorized Access or Disclosure\n\n-
    [Indiana Medicaid warns patients of health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/indiana-medicaid-warns-patients-health-data-breach)\n-
    [Phishing attack at UC Davis leads to health data breach](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/phishing-attack-uc-davis-health-breaches-data-15000-patients)\n\nOther
    than a vector for malware, [phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/)
    can also be used as a method for attackers to simply gain access to systems by
    getting credentials to a system. Or, a well-meaning dev may accidentally breach
    patient data by placing it on a public facing web page. \n\nWhile your mileage
    may vary, our policies have a few tips to help prevent this. First, we require
    [two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#17.7-production-system-security)
    on all production systems. While this doesn't necessarily prevent a system user
    from giving an attacker their credentials *and* auth token (sigh), it reduces
    the risk of unauthorized cross application access and minimizes the window by
    which an attacker can maintain access to an application. We also require access
    to all production systems to be [managed over a VPN with two-factor auth](https://policy.datica.com/#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
    We also have an unofficial \"All data is potentially PHI\" policy for our managed
    integration services hardware/software. While we may have access to test environments
    with mock patient data, we assume that we may be sent PHI from any vendor or healthcare
    organization. As such, we protect all data like PHI as established in our policies.
    \n\n## Theft or Improper Disposal\n\n- [WSU hard drive theft potentially impacts
    1 million people](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/wsu-hard-drive-theft-potentially-impacts-1-million-people)\n-
    [State Employee Dumps Medicaid Worksheets in dumpster](http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/state-employee-dumps-medicaid-worksheets-in-dumpster/article_13f36eb4-1fb4-5278-93e1-1d30a00c9f9a.html)\n\nWhile
    hackers and ransomeware are increasingly perilous, [20% of data breaches reported
    to the OCR are good old fashioned theft and improper disposal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).
    Someone stealing a laptop from a car or a unencrypted hard drive from an office
    to cause a breach are a tale as old as HIPAA itself.\n\nWe may be biased, but
    **stop storing PHI on local machines or on paper**. [We don't](https://policy.datica.com/#7.13-access-to-ephi).
    We only used [approved tools](https://policy.datica.com/#20.-approved-tools-policy)
    with appropriate access controls and encryption to store and transfer PHI. We
    also have [no servers in our offices](https://policy.datica.com/#10.-facility-access-policy)
    and BAAs with our cloud providers. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nDon't [learn about HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    the hard way, either getting beat up by your first 250-question audit or worse:
    by finding yourself on the OCR's Wall of Shame. Consult our policies or let us
    do the lifting for you on our thrice-audited, HITRUST-certified [compliant Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/).

  :summary: In the 377 healthcare data breaches last year, phishing attacks were among
    the top data breach causes. Why is healthcare such a target for spear phishing
    attacks?
  :blog_lead: "At the beginning of August, the BBC reported that a UK-based “prankster”
    had successfully [spoofed the White House.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40788080)
    Through spear phishing emails, this bad actor had not only convinced a senior
    cyber security officer that he was the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor
    Jared Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus
    to fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory
    email exchanges. After posting a few of those emails on Twitter, the culprit promised
    not to do it again and urged the current administration to “tighten up IT policy.”
    While the jokester later indicated his email spoofing had no harmful intent, the
    implications go way beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n"
  :post: "Phishing is a widely used form of social engineering where malicious ne’re-do-wells
    broadcast  disguised emails to a large population in an attempt to steal sensitive
    information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
    not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with
    the term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America
    Online (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked
    themselves as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and
    Ebay. These fraudulent emails would often persuade victims to open a link with
    a malevolent attachment or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing
    scams bred a more targeted type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
    For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
    if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
    someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
    subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
    Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches
    last year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
    report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
    hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches.
    Furthermore, spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting
    CEOs. From 2015 to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent.
    In the first part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health,
    Torrance Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according
    to Healthcare IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so
    far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
    This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
    With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
    spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
    Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica
    Security Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear
    phishing: high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for
    ransomware and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security
    walls when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what
    they want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization,
    is also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing
    attempt that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one
    of our executive’s email addresses. He or she used that email address to request
    a wire transfer from the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the
    department head alerted the appropriate person within Datica about the email and
    its request, and ultimately averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example
    to warn its own customers to such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance
    Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare organizations can better protect themselves
    from such attacks. Her recommendations and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n###
    Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll employees need to be made aware of what
    phishing is and the damage that can result from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines
    the steps he uses to fully inform Datica employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing
    email looks like, explaining how to evaluate such an email and then confirming
    that employees know to whom suspicious emails should be forwarded for evaluation
    are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions that could breach an organization’s
    thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic testing of employees’ knowledge
    and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting internal spear phishing lures
    that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions against doing testing
    at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular that on October
    1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals. \n\n###
    Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in place
    as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is trying
    to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should have
    the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
    Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then
    managing any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program
    “Having zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational
    goal,” says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation
    steps.” \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in
    HITRUST. Datica joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States
    to achieve [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)
    status and believes that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is
    the best way to protect its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity
    and compliance are deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).
    If you’ve ever had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment
    on the Datica platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of
    double verification. The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing
    department to quickly verify and make customer requested adjustments for access.
    Datica utilizes stringent measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers.
    These steps combined with the recommendations above better protect your organization
    for a spear phishing attack. \n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
