:blog_lead: "Recently we published our first five Customer Spotlights, a new section
  on the website sharing the amazing and diverse stories our customers have to tell.
  \n\nWe noticed something interesting when working with our customers: Their origin
  stories, visions on how to change healthcare, and traction were all so compelling,
  and surprisingly diverse. It reminded us of the vastness of healthcare; the industry
  is full of things to be fixed, and there is no shortage of innovators ready to step
  up."
:post: |-
  It got to the point where we knew these stories had to be shared. We would have feel-good moments each time we heard how a customer was truly making a dent in the universe, and wanted to pass those moments onto you.

  So what are these spotlights?

  Unlike traditional "case studies" focusing on jointly achieved outcomes, each spotlight strictly highlights the story of our customer; they have nothing to do with Datica. Instead, we catalog their founding origin stories, broadcast their vision of the future of healthcare, and share in their successes to date. Their efforts to better healthcare deserve their own platform.

  Today five spotlights are available, but more are on the way. The positive response by customers has been fantastic—everyone we've asked has said YES! to being profiled.

  * [Purple Binder][1]: Technology that bridges healthcare systems and social services to impact patient outcomes
  * [CareMessage][2]: Using technology to connect lower-income patients with caring providers
  * [Community Services for the Deaf][3]: Innovative Technologies Protect Personal Health Information and Expand Employment Opportunity
  * [DispatchHealth][4]: A company at the epicenter of the shift to value-based care as it redefines healthcare delivery
  * [Healthfinch][5]: Using technology to automate, delegate and simplify repeatable clinical tasks

  Take a look at our first five spotlights, and keep an eye on many more in the works.

  If you are an existing customer and want to share your story, send us an email at [hello@datica.com][6] to get the conversation started.

  :summary: The challenge for today's hospital CIOs is choosing vendors and technologies
    that integrate with the EMR as well as numerous other hospital systems. That's
    why integration is such a hot topic in healthcare, and is something we take very
    seriously at Voalte.
  :blog_lead: 'Healthcare technology has always been a complex business, and it''s
    not getting any simpler. In the 1960s, mainframes were the behemoth systems that
    stored data, mostly related to a hospital''s accounting functions. In the ''80s
    and ''90s, health IT turned to desktop computers and networking solutions for
    clinical and operational data. In recent years, federal mandates under the American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act caused the focus to shift to electronic medical
    records (EMRs), bringing numerous advantages for patients, medical practices and
    health systems, such as:'
  :post: "* Fewer errors in personal health records\n* Efficient transfer of patient
    data\n* Enhanced workflows that allow for increased productivity\n* Reduction
    of labor and operational costs\n* Superior e-Prescribing and clinical documentation\n\nWhile
    EMRs are powerful systems that have gone a long way in bringing healthcare organizations
    into the digital age, they cannot do everything. Hospitals need numerous systems
    to take full advantage of their EMRs in ways that benefit caregivers, patients,
    and the hospitals that have invested so many resources.\n\nThe challenge for today's
    hospital CIOs is choosing vendors and technologies that integrate with the EMR
    as well as numerous other hospital systems. That's why integration is such a hot
    topic in healthcare, and is something we take very seriously at Voalte.\n\nThe
    first Voalte integrations were with [Philips Intellispace Event Management][1]
    (previously Emergin) and Connexall, which enabled us to give hospital caregivers
    a single end-point device for communication as well as alarm and alert notifications.
    We have since integrated with technologies from many other companies with the
    goal of giving our customers a complete communication platform that ties together
    multiple solutions seamlessly. \n\nIn other industries, integrations are more
    commonplace than in healthcare. Salesforce, for example, started as an application
    platform but has grown into a platform other companies can build on. (See last
    year's news about the [Box-Salesforce][3] integration, which helps their joint
    customers access files more efficiently and lets developers easily embed Box's
    content-management functions into Salesforce.) Facebook and Twitter are examples
    of consumer solutions that allow others to build on their platforms, using APIs
    in ways not originally intended. (If you followed the [Politiwoops][4] story,
    you know that Twitter pulled the plug on this archive of deleted tweets by politicians,
    before reversing that decision as part of its pledge to foster better relationships).\n\nIn
    the future, we believe the Voalte Platform APIs and SDKs will allow partners and
    customers to create innovative solutions that we cannot even begin to imagine.
    Our partnership with Datica is a cornerstone of our strategy of allowing innovators
    who use Voalte Platform to have easy access to EHR data so they can build amazing
    patient-centric solutions. We are able to do this because Datica lets us focus
    on our job rather than on the administrative, compliance burdens.\n\n----\n\n_Alex
    Brown is Director of Strategy at Voalte, where he leads the Product and Partnership
    teams. Over the past five years, he has managed partnerships with leading EMR,
    device and integration vendors._\n\n\n[1]: http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/product/HC866030/intellispace-event-management-information-system\n[3]:

  :summary: Prior to DocbookMD® HIPAA-secure communication didn't exist. Datica was
    not only able to centralize integration for DocbookMD but also save them $360K.
  :blog_lead: |-
    Doctors need HIPAA-secure communication if they are to share [critical patient information][1] and collaborate with medical colleagues. That's what rural primary care doctor [Tracey Haas, MD][2] discovered as she practiced in an area that didn't even have a cardiologist or orthopedic surgeon. HIPAA regulations tied her hands whenever she looked at a patient EKG or X-ray and needed a real-time expert opinion from another doctor, like her husband, orthopedic surgeon [Dr. Tim Gueramy][3]. Prior to the start of [DocbookMD®][4], a secure way to communicate physician-to-physician didn't exist, so doctors, including Haas and Gueramy struggled to provide immediate and efficient care to patients.

    **When the first [iPhone®][5] came out in 2007, [_sans_][6][ camera][6], apps or app store, Haas and Gueramy began talking to other doctors to build the first use cases for DocbookMD, which went from directory app upon its launch in 2009 to communication app and finally to today's iteration -- a critical collaboration platform.**

    Healthcare has a cornocopia of information in a multitude of forms: patient records, medical images, prescriptions, patient bills, insurance claims and data research. Healthcare organizations not only must securely store data but they are mandated to process and cater to this data using a variety of data management and process solutions. If that isn't enough, healthcare providers are also required to have this data available on demand and through boundaries, whilst simultaenously focusing on the core principles of patient care delivery. DocbookMD needed a partner in order to comply with these industry necessities.

    In dealing with an early-stage company, companies often get a mixed bag with performance. However, Haas said that Datica exceeded expectations with zero problems, which has created a positive experience for everyone, especially engineering. Gueramy states that four factors played into the company's decision to go with the [Datica cohesive approach to integration][7] versus building a solution themselves:

    1. **The Datica business model** — "It's cloud-based and exactly like our business model."
    2. **Enabled DocbookMD to scale **—"That was a big one!"
    3. **Allowed the company a way to capture what future costs were going to be** \-- "That provided a way to charge our customers more appropriately and keep our costs down."
    4. **Datica being physician-based** — "That was huge."
