:summary: The Midwest is predicted to have more startups than Silicon Valley in five
  years. It's time for Madison, Wisconsin to be on the startup community's radar.
:blog_lead: 'In a city underrated by those who have never visited, Madison, WI, brings
  more to the Midwest than its prestigious university and famous State Street. The
  Midwest is [predicted to have more startups than Silicon Valley in five years](http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/28/in-5-years-the-midwest-will-have-more-startups-than-silicon-valley/).
  VentureBeat author Chris Olson states, "Today entrepreneurs are building more billion-dollar
  companies in the Midwest than in the last 50 years combined." It''s time for Madison
  to be on the radar among the national startup community.

'
:post: "The entrepreneurial activity in Madison can be attributed to the top talent
  from the University of Wisconsin and large local companies (AmFam, Epic Systems,
  etc). The startup community here varies from micro-breweries to medical devices.
  Whether it's a first-time entrepreneur opening her new soap business or a serial
  entrepreneur focusing on patient engagement, resources bring the entrepreneurial
  community together.\n\nThree examples are [100 State][2], [1 Million Cups][3] and
  the [Weinert Center for Entrepreneurship][4]. Although each resource differs in
  purpose, they share two commonalities: 1) bringing entrepreneurs together and 2)
  leveraging network diversity for growth. Even meetups are growing to help unite
  entrepreneurs in the area. As Brian Lee from Madisonstartups.com put it, \"Madison
  has a full ecosystem of resources and organizations all working toward a common
  goal.\"   \n\nOne example of the community coming together is 1 Million Cups, a
  weekly meetup for startups to present their ideas and receive audience feedback.
  I remember my first time at 1 Million Cups as I watched Datica's Chief Strategy
  Officer present to the audience. The audience consisted of employees from Nordic
  Consulting Group, consulting,  financial firms and startups. This diverse group
  provided great feedback for Datica, while audience engagement buzzed with energy
  and inspired us to further work within the Madison startup community.\n\nLikewise,
  the Madison business community also comes together to support each other, to which
  health technology shines brightly. Datica is thrilled to be a central example: We
  work closely with customers like Propeller Health, Healthfinch, Health eFillings,
  Wellbe, [m]Pirik, Ensodata, True Health Connection, and CE Learning Systems. We
  maintain several integrations with regional health systems, such as Aurora Healthcare,
  Froedtert & The Medical College of WI, and Children's Hospital of WI — all of which
  are taking innovative approaches toward addressing healthcare needs.\n\nAlong with
  industry giants Epic and Nordic, the Madison health technology community is working
  together to solve important problems. As Aristotle once said, \"The whole is greater
  than the sum of its parts,\" and Datica is happy to be a part of it. \n\n\n[2]:

    ## Bringing HITRUST CSF Certification to AWS

    Datica's compliant cloud platform is now HITRUST CSF Certified for its customers hosting workloads on [Amazon Web Services][1] (AWS). Datica passed its Common Security Framework (CSF) assessment from the Health Information Trust Alliance ([HITRUST][2]) — the industry's benchmark for measuring compliance and security. By utilizing AWS services and solutions, Datica provides a fully managed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified platform for the healthcare industry that offers development teams fast, flexible, and secure access to the cloud.

    "Healthcare is an industry in the midst of transitioning to the cloud, and AWS is strategically positioned to service the healthcare industry's computing needs. AWS's work with Datica, a company that focuses on meeting healthcare's unique compliance needs through security frameworks like HITRUST, helps position AWS to play a key role in the health industry's transformation," said Josh Hofmann, Global Lead, Partner Ecosystem, Amazon Web Services, Inc.

    ## Cofounder Dr. Travis Good Featured in Becker's and Practice Mentors

    Is health IT really 'digital snake oil?' Eight industry leaders, including Dr. Travis Good, reacted to Dr. James Madara's speech and were featured in Becker's Health IT & CIO Review. Dr. Madara[ made the comparison][7] in his address at the 2016 AMA Annual Meeting. "From ineffective EHRs to an explosion of direct-to-consumer digital health products to apps, some of which are poor quality — this is the digital snake oil of the 21st century," he said. But not all stakeholders share Dr. Madara's criticism of the digital health landscape. Dr. Travis Good, among other healthcare stakeholders weighed in on "digital snake oil," and whether that's a fair description of the digital health landscape in [Becker's recent publication][8].

    As we all should know, compliance is mandatory. So stop and think about how many electronic devices you use everyday. Are they all HIPAA compliant? Are you assuming that others take care of that for you? Dr. Travis Good had the pleasure of being featured in the [Practice Mentors Podcast: Electronic Devices And HIPAA Compliance Is Mandatory][9]. You may be surprised as you listen to Travis Good and Kathleen Mills discuss the finer points of this topic. You'll want to know these safeguards to protect yourself from unwanted trouble that could end your practice.
