  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Healthâ€”The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,
    among others. His expertise on compliance, HIPAA, and health IT is highly regarded
    and sought after. He recently released his first book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://completecloudcompliance.com). "

:summary: This post covers the not-so-new trend of successful apps evolving into platforms.
:blog_lead: 'I covered an overview of trends for 2014 in my last post. I hedged a
  bit because there are some very broad trends on that list. Hopefully this series
  of posts will add additional detail to what we''re betting on for 2014. This post
  covers the not-so-new trend of successful apps evolving into platforms.

'
:post: "Everybody loves platforms. We're a platform company too, a backend platform
  for health apps. Platforms can be very powerful and disruptive, but can also be
  challenging to sell without specific solutions pre-built on the platform. Also,
  as people build applications they may automate or create reusable components that
  will later turn into a platform offering. And dogfooding your own platform while
  building solutions is the best way to test and refine a platform.\r\n\r\nThe shift
  from app to platform isn't unique to digital health. Twitter started as an app that's
  now a platform. Facebook is very similar. So is Salesforce. The list goes on and
  on to include others like Netflix and Spotify. Even the Pebble watch is a wrist-based
  platform now. There a lots of examples; too many to mention here actually.\r\n\r\nPlatforms
  expand the functionality and value by integrating 3rd party apps and data. This
  is almost always done today with APIs. Once apps grow large enough in terms of adoption
  and user base, opening up an API and becoming a platform makes sense because 1)
  it adds value and stickiness for current users, 2) it opens up revenue streams through
  transaction fees for 3rd party apps (think Apple's 30% for app purchases in the
  iOS or Mac App Store), and 3) it's attractive to 3rd parties because they have a
  decent base of customers to target.\r\n\r\nIn digital health the battle to be the
  platform is usually about aggregating data. Today we see two main buckets of platform
  players emerging in health and wellness - the electronic medical records (EMRs)
  and the quantified self companies. There are some exceptions to the rule, but generally
  these buckets cover the platforms that are leading the way.\r\n\r\nOn the EMR/EHR
  side of things, several vendors opened^1 up APIs and app stores last year. The biggest
  players that made waves were Athena, Greenway, and Allscripts. The value for EHRs
  is quite clear - EHRs sit on the clinical data for organizations and 3rd party apps
  can theoretically add value to patients, admins, and providers. In the process EHRs
  secure their place as the center of the enterprise health IT universe, or the mothership.
  The biggest challenge is that EHRs store tons and tons of data, and exposing it
  is a meaningful way is hard. If you look at API documentation for EHRs, it is resource
  based and very hard for a developer to use.\r\n\r\nThe other major challenge for
  EHRs is that they were built for the past, and still mostly current, paradigm in
  healthcare - episodic care. As more organizations shift paradigms to risk based
  business models (ACOs, capitation, etc), are EHRs the platforms of choice to serve
  as the foundation for models of care for which they weren't intended or architected?
  It's a good question, and a debate that will heat up over the next several years.\r\n\r\nThe
  one other EHR to note in this discussion is Epic. Epic made some press last fall
  when it announced the launch of [open.epic](http://open.epic.com/). The site today
  simply lists the companies that have integrated with Epic. Going forward, the idea
  is to enable vendors API access to Epic for writing data to Epic. It is unclear
  whether APIs will be open to read data from Epic. It's an interesting departure
  for Epic as it has stated (I've personally heard Epic people say this) that Epic
  doesn't have partners, it has customers. It remains to be seen if open.epic will
  enable partnerships, or just be a new version of the existing model where vendors
  have to sell to Epic customers, then have those customers get/pay Epic to open up
  an interface.\r\n\r\nThe other category of apps, other than EHRs, in heathcare that
  have evolved to platforms are on the quantified self side, or patient data reporting/collection
  side. The platforms here are trying to integrate data from as many self reported
  devices and apps as they can. The major players on that side right now are Fitbit,
  which keeps raising tons of money for its vision, and Runkeeper with its Healthgraph
  API. There are others smaller players like Nike, Jawbone, LoseIt!, and MapMyFitness
  (acquired by Under Armour for $150 million in 2013) that are making similar transitions.
  Aetna has made a big push into this area with its CarePass platform. Currently this
  category is primarily used by the motivated healthy, who are not the main drivers
  of healthcare cost. We are starting to see pilots of some of these apps and platforms
  with payers and health systems. In 2014 we'll see more of these pilots, and more
  3rd party integrations with these platforms.\r\n\r\nThe other major platform plays
  in digital health are 1) Healthtap and Zocdoc on the consumer side and 2) Doximity^2
  on the provider side. The major difference with these platforms is the power of
  the platform is less about health or wellness data and more about the number of
  users. In certain ways, they are doing what Facebook did in going from a network
  to a platform.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 it's unlikely we'll see much in the way of cross mingling
  between these different categories of platforms but we'll see. All of them will
  be pushing to get data into and out of other domains (quantified self to EHR and
  vice versa). And we'll like see a few more successful apps go the platform route
  in 2014.\r\n\r\n1 Open\" is used loosely here. Most EHR vendors with APIs or app
  stores are not open in the same way that Facebook or Twitter are open. This is usually
  by design, as the data is much more sensitive and ownership of data can get murky.
  With EHRs, \"open\" usually means apply and do a manual review.\r\n\r\n2 Doximity
  started with a clear platform and network vision so it's not quite the same as an
  app app, like Runkeeper for example, that evolved to a platform, though it is still
  early with its API.\r\n\r\n"
