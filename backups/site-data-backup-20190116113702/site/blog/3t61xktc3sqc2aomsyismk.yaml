:summary: With thousands of retweets in mere hours, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter’s
  tweet of a Giants player's medical record prompted a backlash about personal privacy.
:blog_lead: 'With over 7,000 retweets and 3,000 favorites in mere hours, ESPN reporter
  Adam Schefter’s [tweet](https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/618918579770146816)
  has prompted a backlash about personal privacy. Many are asking if the content is
  considered [PHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi)
  and covered under HIPAA. Many believe the ethics of the tweet are questionable regardless.
  We felt it helpful to explain the situation through the lens of our HIPAA expertise.
  Spoiler: This is most likely _not_ a breach of HIPAA regulations.

:post: "### HIPAA Does NOT Apply to the News Media\n\nAs the federal [Act](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/)
  states, news media entities are not directly impacted by HIPAA unless the employer
  serves as a healthcare provider by offering some sort of medical benefit or if a
  member of media publication was working for a covered entity. Members of the media
  are permitted to request what is referred to as “Directory Information” if they
  request the patient’s information by name and the patient has not opted out of the
  directory. Directory information includes, and is limited to, the name, location
  on site, and general condition. Media will be unable to get specifics about a patient
  unless the patient discloses of their own notion, or the patient has given written
  authorization to the covered entity to publicize their PHI. \n\nAn interesting summary
  from the [Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press](http://www.rcfp.org/)
  is available [here](http://www.rcfp.org/rcfp/orders/docs/MEDPRIV.pdf).\n\nUnless
  Schefter planned a heist to break into the hospital and steal Jason Pierre-Paul’s
  records, ESPN and Schefter are in the clear from HIPAA legalities because there
  is nothing unlawful for a reporter to merely do the job of receiving and relaying
  actionable news items. \n\nThe true felonious actions will lie with the clinicians
  or the institution if the records were shared without consent from Pierre-Paul prior
  to the leak. \n\nThanks to the dawn of social media and ease at which information
  is spread in the modern age, the topic of what holds up to ethical standards and
  who should face the legalities of HIPAA will be a debate waged for years to come.
  Just note that there is a difference between what is legal and what is ethical.\n\nHave
