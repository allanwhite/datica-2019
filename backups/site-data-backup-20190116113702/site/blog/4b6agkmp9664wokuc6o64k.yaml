:summary: Do I need a business associate agreement to comply with HIPAA when doing
  medical credit card processing for healthcare payments?
:blog_lead: "Credit card processing is one of the most common payment methods in healthcare,
  especially as the American economy becomes growingly paperless. The information
  transmitted when processing a credit card is often unconsidered, as well as the
  potential repercussions of a privacy breach, because many are unaware that this
  data is [protected health information](/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
  (PHI). The data components in this transaction include the processor’s information
  (primary care giver), name of credit card owner (patient), and specified time of
  transaction. Knowing just this much could allow data hackers to target specific
  patients, therefore classifying credit card data as ePHI (electronic protected health
  information). \n"
:post: "## Credit Card Processors and Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)\n\nMany
  wonder if they need a [business associate agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/)
  with payment providers and services to comply with HIPAA. Although processing payments
  through a credit-card processor generates PHI, [Health and Human Services (HHS)](http://www.hhs.gov/)
  has stated that this process is specifically excluded from certain HIPAA mandates,
  as well as BAA requirements - the key word here being ‘certain’. \n\nJust like many
  of the convoluted directives of [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/),
  the compliance solution is not black or white. So although simple credit card processing
  may not mandate an enacted BAA, if the card processor being utilized also offers
  services like gift cards, reporting, analysis, account balance, accounts receivable,
  etc. then a BAA must be put in place to achieve HIPAA compliance. So when deciding
  on how you plan to receive credit card payments when pertaining to healthcare transactions,
  you must first decide what services you want. If the extra services are beneficial
  to your business, find a processor that is willing to sign a BAA. If not, a simple
  credit card processor is exempt from the HIPAA BAA requirements but, as a word of
  caution, remain conscious of the [PCI regulations](/academy/why-hipaa-is-not-pci/)
  that are strictly enforced and consequences of non compliance could result in some
  hefty fines and loss in reputation.\n\nFor further reading, check out these other

  :summary: Simply put, a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) defines responsibility,
    and thus liability, with respect to the handling of PHI data.
  :blog_lead: 'HIPAA guidelines define the safeguards for protected health information
    (PHI). Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) are contracts that outline how different
    organizations will handle electronic protected health information (ePHI) and the
    types of responsibilities that each organization assumes.  Simply put, a BAA defines
    responsibility, and thus liability, with respect to the handling of PHI data.

'
  :post: "We've written about [BAAs before](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    Start there for a general understanding. The rest of this article, as well as
    a [Part 2 that talks about the top 5 things to look for in a business associate
    agreement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/top-5-things-you-find-in-an-ideal-business-associate-agreement/),
    will dive into why selecting a BAA is important, and give guidance when doing
    so.\n\n## It's not just a checkbox\n\n>   A chain is only as strong as its weakest
    link.\n>   —  A wise engineer\n\nDatica has talked to many companies about their
    HIPAA compliant hosting requirements and how our Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
    can address their requirements. Our mission is to help them get most of the way
    down the road of [HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    Often we discuss the topic of other vendors in the space, both similar HIPAA-compliant
    platforms or traditional companies like AWS, Firehost, Bluebox, etc. While the
    conversion usually focuses on technology and features, we emphasize the differences
    in our business associate agreements as well, because, in some ways, it is our
    best feature. With Datica, you sign one BAA to cover the entire compliance spectrum.\n\nUnlike
    several others, we do not require a non-disclosure agreement (NDAs) to view our
    BAA. In fact, it's [publicly available](https://policy.datica.com/#catalyze-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa)
    as a part of our [open-sourced policies](https://catalyzeio.github.io/policies);
    we often encourage newer companies to use the business associate agreement template
    as a starting point for their own BAA. We specifically set aside time with new
    customers to explain what it covers and what is doesn't and why.\n\nIt is very
    important you read the language in the BAA from your vendor and understand it
    well. While it might seem the thought \"I have a BAA with my vendor\" is sufficient,
    the reality is when a breach or any other kind of security incident happens, you're
    at risk for whatever was declared in your BAA. In many ways a BAA is a mechanism
    for transferring risk (and thus liability) from one entity to another by having
    each entity acknowledging their responsibility in managing specific aspects of
    the legal mandates. \n\n## Briefly, how a business associate agreement works\n\nBusiness
    associate agreements became a lot more interesting with the passing of the new
    HITECH HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013, which expanded upon the definition of _business
    associate_ to include something called subcontractors. _Subcontractors_ are typically
    service or technology organizations that provide additional services to the business
    associates, which are providing services for the covered entities.\n\nThe effect
    has been increased chaining of responsibilities—a good thing in today's technology
    landscape. As the internet, cloud computing, and APIs have broken down silos,
    more applications rely on different layers of technology and services, [considered
    subcontractors](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/).
    These _subcontractors_ (e.g. Datica, AWS) sign BAAs with _business associates_
    (you), who in turn sign a BAA with _covered entities_ (health system, health plan).\n\nIt
    is critical for you to remember that ultimately you, as the business associate
    signing a contract with a covered entity, are the one left holding the ball. It
    is your responsibility to ensure the following:\n\n- **Know your BAAs.** Since
    a chain of entities (like IaaS / hosting providers, APIs and SaaS) touch the ePHI,
    each must have BAAs in place with you that are consistent and not contradictory.
    For example, a business associate selling to Hospital ABC can't agree to a 24-hour
    breach notification policy if the hosting provider has a physical breach notification
    policy of 2 months.\n- **Meet your responsibilities.** If all the hosting provider
    gives you is VMs and VPN access, you are now responsible for everything else HIPAA
    demands. We're talking about encryption at-rest or in-transit (even within your
    dedicated environment), dedicated logging, and so on. Know what HIPAA requires
    and what you're left having to take care of yourself!\n\n## The takeaway\n\nThat
    leaves you with an intriguing proposition. By choosing Datica, you only ever have
    to sign one BAA. Never will you have to worry about lining up consistency with
    multiple vendors, or dreading the anxiety of gaps not covered.\n\nIn our next
    article, we will take a look at the top things you should look for in a BAA. If
    you have any BAA questions, feel free to [email us](mailto:hello@datica.com),
    we're always happy to help.\n\n"

  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

  :summary: The cost of a HIPAA audit depends on audit type – HIPAA gap assessment,
    full HIPAA audit, or validated HITRUST assessment – and indirect costs like time.
  :blog_lead: |-
    > You must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. — Andrew Jackson

    At Datica we've been through [three external audits](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/hitrust/) conducted by a large, national auditing firm. In all three cases, I've personally led the efforts from our side, coordinating our internal resources as needed. I wouldn't call it a fun process, but it has helped add rigor to our internal security and compliance programs. It validated the hard work we've done to build a fully [HIPAA compliant platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), and associated organization, that exceeds the HIPAA rules. We've also learned what does and does not meet HIPAA standards from an external or auditor perspective.
  :post: "Cost seems to be one of a few gating factors for companies considering a
    HIPAA audit. It's certainly a topic we are asked about constantly. I touched on
    the cost of audits in my last post on [proving HIPAA compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/proving-hipaa-compliance/).
    If you look at the cost of a HIPAA audit, it breaks into two broad categories.\n\n1.
    Direct costs\n2. Indirect costs.\n\nLet's walk through how costs are calculated
    in both.\n\n## Direct Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nThe easier bucket to calculate.
    It begins with the costs for an auditing firm to conduct the audit and deliver
    a report. Curiously, the auditor's charge is frequently used by most people use
    to calculate the overall cost of an audit, which is definitely not accurate. Different
    types of HIPAA audits exist. The costs are different for each. Datica has completed
    all of the audits below.\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment**. The best starting point.
    It is meant to identify gaps and remediation plans for those gaps. It's the cheapest
    option and least time consuming. It often does not require an onsite visit from
    an auditor. A gap assessment leads to a full HIPAA audit; after the gap assessment,
    organizations spend time addressing the gaps before beginning a full HIPAA audit.
    **The direct cost is about $15,000-$20,000.**\n* **Full HIPAA Audit**. A full
    HIPAA audit, when applied to technology vendors, assesses an organization against
    all the [requirements in HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
    It's a long list. It includes both technical settings and configurations as well
    as administrative requirements like training and business associate agreements.
    It will involve an auditor visit and will require documentation to support claims
    about security and compliance; this can include showing specific technology settings
    like password rules and guest access. **The direct cost is about $20,000-$25,000.**\n*
    **Validated HITRUST Assessment**. HITRUST is a more [complete, certifiable version
    of HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/). It was created by large healthcare
    enterprises to mirror PCI compliance. It is similar to a full HIPAA audit but
    goes into much more granular detail about the maturity of controls and compliance
    programs. There's now a standard web app that you use to enter information. Those
    entries are then validated by HITRUST approved assessor. Then HITRUST, the organization,
    reviews all the entries, typically asks for more evidence, and you hopefully get
    HITRUST CSF Certified at the end. The direct costs for this include both fees
    to HITRUST and to your auditor (approved assessor). **The direct cost is about
    $30,000-$45,000** (cost can be much higher for larger organizations).\n\n## Indirect
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\n> It's really clear that the most precious resource
    we all have is time. - Steve Jobs\n\nIndirect costs are harder to quantify. The
    biggest factor to consider is time. For each of the types of audit above, the
    indirect costs increases as you move down the list. For each of our audits, we
    estimated the total time spent for all employees (we didn't break it out by each
    employee so it's not perfect).\n\n* **Gap Assessment: 40 hours.**\n* **Full HIPAA
    Audit: 100 hours.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment: 200 hours.**\n\nEqually
    hard to estimate was the time spent between each audit to address issues and \"harden\"
    our compliance and info sec programs. This time was not captured for any of the
    specific audits and contributes to the overall cost of compliance.\n\n## Total
    Costs of a HIPAA Audit\n\nWe conservatively estimated the cost of an hour of work
    to be $100/hour. This is partially loss for the cost of salaries + benefits and
    partially loss from opportunity cost of not doing other things with this time
    (writing code, customer support, sales, marketing, etc). Based on those numbers,
    the total cost of the different audits are:\n\n* **HIPAA Gap Assessment - $17,800-$22,800.**
    \n* **Full HIPAA Audit - $27,000-$32,000.**\n* **Validated HITRUST Assessment
    - $44,000-$59,000.** \n\n## It's more than cost\n\nIf you are considering an audit,
    cost is only one consideration. Audits are time consuming and distracting, factors
    that are hard to quantify. Weigh the audit's value for your organization. For
    us, it was a nobrainer because our audits are part of our value proposition to
    customers. We have many customers that effectively scale sales without having
    done audits themselves, so it's not essential to closing deals, even very large
    deals.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the cost of an audit is not simply
    a cost at one point in time. Audits are typically followed by annual reviews,
    sort of like miniature audits. These too cost money, eat time, and can be a distraction.
    We're working on calculating the overall cost of being [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    so stay tuned for more soon. Also, if you have audit insights you can share, [we'd

  :summary: Guess what? HIPAA doesn't say how long you have to keep medical records.
    This is a common misconception of HIPAA data retention policy.
  :blog_lead: 'It may come as a surprise, but you don''t have to retain medical records
    according to [HIPAA rules](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/three-hipaa-omnibus-rule-essentials-for-it-security/).
    This is a very common misconception with HIPAA. Medical records means electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) in this case. HIPAA does not have any rules
    that require covered entities or business associates to retain ePHI. I assume
    this is a common question for HHS as they have it listed in a [HIPAA FAQ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/580/does-hipaa-require-covered-entities-to-keep-medical-records-for-any-period/index.html).

'
  :post: "![Point 6 of HIPAA retention rules](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/646QbbgQqk0oWkeqSuuYMg/d33d3aa0a6d900257741cf80cb628538/blog-main-retention.png)\n\nThe
    confusion likely stems from two things. First, most states have requirements that
    covered entities retain ePHI for a certain period of time, even if the covered
    entity closes its doors; I imagine the most common case of a covered entity closing
    is a physician retiring. As a covered entitiy, the onus is on you to understand
    the requirements in the states that you work in and to comply with them.\n\nThis
    is a case I'm personally exposed to right now as a doc friend is retiring and
    is trying to figure out what to do with his medical records for the next 10 years.
    His records are all paper and he's retiring to avoid having to use an EHR. Yes,
    this does happen and some doctors feel so strongly, in a bad way, about EHRs that
    they are are retiring early to avoid having to change the way they've practiced
    for 30, 40, or even 50 years.\n\nThere are issues that arise when a [business
    associate](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    such as an EHR company, goes out of business and the covered entity needs to get
    the records and find a way to store them. We've seen this experience too, especially
    in the case of smaller, specialty specific EHRs and practice management systems.
    More on this in another post.\n\nThe second reason for the misconception about
    HIPAA and retention of ePHI is that HIPAA does have data retention rules but,
    oddly enough, they don't apply to ePHI. **Section 164.316(b)(1)** of HIPAA require
    orgs:\n\n> (i) Maintain the policies and procedures implemented to comply with
    this subpart in written (which may be electronic) form; and (ii) if an action,
    activity or assessment is required by this subpart to be documented, maintain
    a written (which may be electronic) record of the action, activity, or assessment.”
    \n\n**Section 164.316(b)(2)(i)** goes on to state:\n\n> Retain the documentation
    required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 6 years from the date of its
    creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later.”\n\nThere
    are lots of policy and documentation requirements in HIPAA, and the rules around
    data retention apply to those. You should be maintaining all of your policies
    and documentation that address aspects of HIPAA, and you should plan to retain
    it all for 6 years at a minimum. You should also maintain all risk assessments,
    audits, and other documentation related to your organization.\n\n## Datica policy
    and documentation retention\n\nAt Datica we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for
    version control on our policies, and the current versions are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
    and maintained in a Master branch. [More on why we do this in a separate post](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/our-company-policies-now-available-free-on-github/).\n\nWe
    backup our current policies using Box. For risk assessments, change and configuration
    management, vulnerability scanning, and audits we also use Box as a repository.
    You can see our current policies here - [policy.datica.com](https://policy.datica.com).\n\n"

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
