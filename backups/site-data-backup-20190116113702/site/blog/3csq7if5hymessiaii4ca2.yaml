  ## The story behind the rebrand

  Catalyze was a great name for the start of our company  but posed challenges for us as we grew. When talking with others who have been in a similar situation, I found our case was not unique. In fact, this is a situation many companies face  but few talk about it.

  [I talk about the background of the rebrand here](/catalyze/), where I go into deeper detail about the reasonings for the name change. We believe in transparency as a core tenant to all we do, and talking through a rebrand is no different.

  ## Changing the name, not our promises

  While we say goodbye to Catalyze, we are not parting with what makes us the type of business hundreds of organizations trust. We still plan to carry on our foundational traits:

  * Transparency in how we operate internally and externally
  * Commitment to customer success
  * Trust is earned
  * Compliance is fundamental to the success of digital health but is not a differentiator
  * Interoperability is about workflows enablement and not simply data exchange
  * Open source benefits everyone and we're committed to contributing where we can
  * Above all else, deliver on our promises

  ## Healthcare in the cloud

  We're still focused on the same mission as before: products to accelerate the adoption and impact of digital health. We do that through our [Compliant Cloud](/compliant-cloud/) and [Managed Integration](/managed-integration/) offerings. Formerly Stratum and Redpoint, our two core products enable teams across healthcare to remove the barriers associated to digital health by creating trust and solving the problems of integration.

  We also offer [Strategic Services](/strategic-services) for those organizations looking to better develop, test, and implement a digital health strategy. Hospitals and innovative teams across healthcare have found our mix of industry expertise and technical acumen to be a strong voice in the void.

  All this aligns with healthcare's movement to the cloud. Part of the name change is to reaffirm that Datica is the platform for healthcare's transformation. We make it possible for digital health to be a real impact in the industry because we make the interconnectedness of the cloud a reality—finally. And it all comes down to data being secure, compliant, and connected.

  Let us know what you think about the rebrand by tweeting at our new Twitter name [@daticahealth](https://twitter.com/daticahealth).

  On to the next chapter!

  :summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
    the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  :blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
    5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
    so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
    this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the
    benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant
    hosting. \n"
  :post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
    The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
    changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So
    when you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large
    unit at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
    safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
    causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
    — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
    Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
    and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
    while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
    migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
    migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
    innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help
    them find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them
    and to the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health
    systems is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those
    financial efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those
    applications on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation
    between healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value
    it brings to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing
    to Healthcare as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information
    and also do it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to
    the kind of storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
    that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
    to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
    shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value
    to Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
    model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the
    patient as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further,
    the fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded
    physicians and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments.
    On the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
    and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
    computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
    models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
    it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
    to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
    Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
    records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas
    of our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control
    of their own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal
    data on everything from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer
    point of view, expectations in data availability are seamless from one part of
    their lives to the next. They not only expect to be able to access all of their
    own healthcare data, just as they do with their bank data, but they expect to
    be able to provide the data they’re generating with wearables and apps back to
    healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient
    Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals and health systems to face the challenge
    of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected environment
    to exchange data with their patients. It also provides the means to handle the
    massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner.
    On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability is more feasible
    in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally and externally,
    is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is there a need to
    easily exchange data between internal departments, for example, between an EHR
    and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers and
    the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
    organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
    computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
    ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange
    faster and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very
    similar economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables
    exchange to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B.
    But not everybody’s interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to
    get from A to B.” — Grahame Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the
    [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/)
    \n\nHealthcare consumerism is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud
    adoption essential to provider success. Healthcare organizations need to make
    very quick decisions about integrations and new technology. Their innovation centers
    require a quick, affordable, and secure platform to rapidly test while maintaining
    the confidentiality of patient information. That platform needs to be scalable
    as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially. It also needs to be
    interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
    are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
    of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital
    enterprises and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways
    to quickly test and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms
    allow for the agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation.
    \n\n## HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
    transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
    can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
    levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified
    platform such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director
    Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management
    includes strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability
    of access, reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and
    health systems race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that
    include everything from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant
    cloud hosting platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads
    the industry with the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure.
    [Datica Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified
    on AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry
    privacy and security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing
    Benefits Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the
    benefits of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling
    to ignore. Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology
    at lower initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare
    organizations enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation
    and modernization become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the
    value-based transformation can actually take place.\n"

  :summary: 'Mark Olschesky shares what he learned, saw, and enjoyed at the 2nd annual
    HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable. Hint: FHIR is fast becoming a reality.'
  :blog_lead: I recently traveled to Duke University to both attend and present at
    the 2nd [HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable](http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/roundtable/2017/03/).
    This topped my must-attend 2017 events after I attended the first event last fall
    in Boston. Here's what I learned, saw, and enjoyed at the applications roundtable.
  :post: "## A Recap of the HL7 FHIR Applications Roundtable\n\n### Datica's presentation\nI
    presented a demonstration of Datica, highlighting how vendors and innovation groups
    can use [Compliant Cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) to build applications
    that aggregate hospital registration and scheduling feeds along with vitals and
    results from multiple organizations. They can then build the longitudinal patient
    records in an easy to query method. Of course, the underlying data storage format
    and query mechanisms are those provided by FHIR. It's an effective catalyst for
    companies building a new product that relies on data integration, especially from
    disparate sources. If you need to facilitate faster application development for
    you or your team, let us know and we’ll schedule a demo.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/MpnXJGu24MqkQo88WOWMu/f737b76a63cf82ad05e296baaa631752/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-interior-w.-DMU-logo.jpg)\n
    \n### More live demos\nWhile the last FHIR Applications Roundtable featured many
    \"conceptual\" demonstrations of applications, during this second roundtable we
    saw more applications directly embedded into EHRs; presenters demonstrated their
    apps within the Cerner and Epic EHRs. After this year’s presentations, I can say
    with even more certainty that FHIR is for real.\n \n### Real-life use cases for
    PHRs and patient-initiated interoperability\nPersonal Health Records (PHRs) have
    existed for years, but often lacked true utility due to their inability to integrate
    directly with EHRs and their associated patient portals. As such, most PHRs operated
    via manual patient entry of their data into the PHR software. This had changed.
    Multiple demos showed how PHRs could use SMART on FHIR to access data from multiple
    EHRs and patient portals, all with permissions and scope set by the patient. Live
    demos highlighted this functionality, including one given by Michele Mottini from
    CareEvolution showing access of data from Cedars-Sinai My CS-Link (powered by
    Epic's MyChart). As someone who operates primarily on the B2B side of interoperability
    but yearned for real solutions around patient-initiated interoperability, seeing
    that patients will have the ability to aggregate data from multiple portals and
    hospitals soon is exciting. A hat tip to Epic and Cerner for making this happen.\n
    \n### Need for API management\nA few vendors provided presentations on how access
    controls could be layered on top of FHIR for more pragmatic management of FHIR
    resources. It seems like [EMR vendors are remaining hands-off](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/)
    in this space, leading other vendors to rush in to fill the gap in API management
    (including Datica!).\n \n### People from all sides of the healthcare technology
    spectrum\nThe ability to talk to employees from startups, publicly-traded companies,
    hospitals and payers, life sciences and pharma all in the same place is amazing
    at the Apps Roundtable. Once again, [people are investing time and resources in
    FHIR](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/). A data standard is only
    as good as its utility and more and more companies are pledging to utilize it.
    As someone who wants to see interoperability improved through pragmatic standards-based
    integration, this provides hope that we'll get there.\n\n### Duke is lovely\nAfter
    things wrapped up on Wednesday, I meandered around the Medical School. Taking
    a short walk from the hospital towards the Duke Chapel and Gardens on a nice sunny
    day provided a peaceful environment only steps from the hospital.\n\n![MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/32c1t5oUPSUSScGW0UM2gi/175e508b0ac48fb5a8492063b591199b/MarkO-at-Duke-U-Med-exterior.jpg)\n\nDatica
    is a proud member of the [HL7 organization](http://www.hl7.org/). Basing our integration
    and data management approaches around standards like FHIR gives our customers
    the best chance at being future-proof vs. proprietary data formats built by other
    vendors. These HL7 events gives us a first-hand look at what others are working
    on and how we can help make that happen with Datica Compliant Cloud.\n\n*Get the
