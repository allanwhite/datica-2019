:summary: Healthcare's version of the Internet of Things is often referred to as connected
  health. Explore Dr. Joe Kvedar's view on the state of connected health.
:blog_lead: The healthcare industry’s version of the Internet of Things (IOT) is very
  often referred to as the [Internet of Health Things](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/the-health-internet-of-things-iot/)
  or, more commonly, connected health. When most people talk about connected health,
  they’re referring to the devices, wearables, apps, and other tools that track an
  individual’s activity or aspects of their health. However, connected health is much
  more than just a set of devices. As connected health becomes a reality in today’s
  world, a new model of healthcare delivery is evolving with innovative strategies
  to move care from the hospital or doctor’s office into the day-to-day lives of people.
:post: "\nIn a recent Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast, [Datica interviewed Joe
  Kvedar, MD](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/joseph-kvedar), Vice President, Connected
  Health with Partners HealthCare. Last year, he wrote [“The Internet of Healthy Things,”](http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/)
  which is packed with real-world information that will help entrepreneurs, innovators,
  and investors drive the disruption of healthcare delivery. Dr. Kvedar has long been
  a proponent of personalization in healthcare and is known as one of the greatest
  HIT influencers in our generation.\n\n>\"There are still some technology problems
  to be solved. Chief among them is the ability to normalize the data from all of
  these wearable sensors so that it makes sense.\" -Joe Kvedar, MD\n\n##The connected
  health journey\nSome aspects of connected health are in play already today and we’re
  only likely a few years away from reaping the full benefits of this connected health
  journey. Dr. Kvedar described that journey unfolding in three major phases:\n\n1.
  **The future is here today in terms of technology.** The majority of the technology
  is ready for this connected, internet of healthy things world, but some roadblocks
  prevent clinical providers from leveraging some of this new information. Dr. Kvedar
  offers, “There are still some technology problems to be solved. Chief among them
  is the ability to normalize the data from all of these wearable sensors so that
  it makes sense.” With wearable technology such as a Fitbit, for example, we can
  already measure steps and calories, but does that tell us a useful story? Dr. Kvedar
  explains, “They don’t tell a story because no one has been able to translate that
  data into something that is normalized. So that's a gap.”\n2. **Data analysis will
  become more personal.** The second step in the connected health journey involves
  the ability to take all those data feeds and analyze them effectively. “One thing
  that is most exciting about those data feeds is that they do represent a unique
  digital fingerprint for each of us, because we do those things all uniquely, whether
  it is the way we travel with our phones, or our step counts.” Dr. Kvedar says. “The
  next technical challenge is to be able to harness all of that data and create a
  unique profile.”\n3. **Business engagement.** The final part of the connected health
  journey is the engagement with the consumer to propel action, for example, motivating
  them to make a healthier choice. This third level is just starting to happen today
  despite both technical and business model hurdles, although Dr. Kvedar says the
  business model hurdles are starting to break down. “For instance, United Health
  Group now offers 100,000 insured people a smart wearable device. If they achieve
  three kinds of fitness goals during a day, as measured by that wearable device,
  they get $4.00 added into their health savings account.” \n\nSome parts of the healthcare
  industry seem to embrace the connected health journey faster than others. “Companies
  like Walgreens are embracing this idea of taking in wearables’ data and giving consumers
  something back in return. They are all seeing improved outcomes as a result,” comments
  Dr. Kvedar. On the other end of the adoption scale are doctors and hospitals. “Docs
  and hospitals are used to making a living by taking care of sick people and we haven't
  quite figured out how to reward clinicians for keeping people well or how to reward
  hospitals for keeping people out of hospitals.” Those business model challenges
  are happily being worked on,” Kvedar explains.\n \n##Roadblocks to interoperability
  \nEven though the technology is just about there to enable connected health for
  consumers, there are still major industry changes that need to occur in the area
  of interoperability.  Dr. Kvedar described these biggest impediments to interoperability:\n
  \n- **Proprietary technology.** Interoperability doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s
  financial best interests. Take a look at technology vendors, for example. “If you
  are an IT vendor, almost all of them, up and down the stack, whether it's  telecom
  all the way down to database, or even hardware, all of them want to bring you in
  and upsell you new things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others
  entering their space, and that means that they are doing something proprietary to
  keep you as a customer,” explains Dr. Kvedar.\n- **Fear of losing patients.** On
  the hospital side of things, resistance to interoperability is primarily driven
  by the fear of losing patients to competitive hospitals. Dr. Kvedar comments, “From
  a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients
  to take their data to another hospital and get their care done there? To implement
  interoperability costs a lot of money. If there's no revenue reward or efficiency
  award on the business side, why would you do it?” Dr. Kvedar sees one possible way
  hospitals might get on board with interoperability. “The only way I could conceive
  of having interoperability become the norm is to have a demand from government purchasers
  that if you are going to be a government contract, you have to have a certain set
  of open standards. I don’t know if that will happen under a Trump administration,
  but they certainly are signaling that they wouldn't view the world that way. So,
  I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.”\n \n##Wearables and chronic illness
  management prevention\nWith the data available to consumers wearing health technology
  devices, the potential exists for not only managing chronic illnesses but also helping
  to prevent them. Dr. Kvedar cites two important considerations:\n\n- **Wearables
  provide a feedback loop.** “I like to talk about conditions that don't result in
  symptoms, like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, visceral
  fat — all of those which portend bad outcomes down the line and don't really, on
  a day-to-day basis, make you feel particularly poorly. In that context, you can
  think about connected health as feedback loops and motivation.” Wearables provide
  feedback loops since they are giving you data about your life. With a Fitbit, for
  example, if you haven’t hit your step goal for the day, you may be motivated to
  walk on a treadmill in the evening.\n- **Raw numbers don’t always motivate a lifestyle
  change.** The other part of making feedback useable is motivation. “It turns out
  there's a bit of paradox at play. A big part of our population doesn’t care about
  numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative person,
  or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback loop is sending
  your way, it quickly becomes background noise,” Dr. Kvedar explains. That could
  be why the market for wearables is seeing a decline in activity.\n\nHe continues,
  “The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming out now in the wearables
  space that give insights rather than just numbers. One of them is the Spire device
  that tracks respiration but doesn't tell you your respiratory rate; it tells you
  whether you’ve been focused or stressed because we breathe differently under different
  conditions.” We may see a rebound in the wearables market as data becomes more meaningful
  to people with insights rather than just numbers.\n \n##How does all this data into
  a clinician’s workflow?\nClinicians today are inundated with data, most of it today
  within the EHR. Clinicians spend too much time clicking, finding, charting, and
  checking boxes to document the in-person encounters or manage a workflow. It’s hard
  to imagine connected health data fitting within the clinician's already data-heavy
  process. Dr. Kvedar suggests this particular journey will unfold in two steps: \n
  \n1. **The current state:** Innovation practices exist but are not mainstream. Dr.
  Kvedar sees connected health in play today, but primarily in medical homes. “We
  have quite a few examples of that in our system, where we are heavily at risk and
  a lot of our primary care practices are patient centers or medical homes as part
  of our population health management structure. In those practices, there is someone
  whose responsibility is the burden of hypertension, just for instance. We will provide
  that person with a home monitoring for hypertension toolset for the patients that
  are either difficult to control or newly diagnosed. In any given practice it is
  not enough of a burden if this one person, typically a nurse and sometimes a pharmacist,
  is assigned the burden of data. It isn’t high enough that they can't afford to get
  their work done. They check in a couple of times a week and the software flags the
  patients that are out of parameter and makes it a little bit easier to sort through.
  Then they involve a doctor if it is a medication change or something that really
  needs a doctor's input.”\n2. **The future state commands an AI layer.**  Most industries
  today are already using intelligent analysis software and data science that creates
  meaning and actionable information from a vast state of data. Dr. Kvedar describes
  how this might take shape in healthcare. “We are really at the beginning of a new
  era. Let's say someone has high blood pressure and you've been tracking their blood
  pressure for the last two months. We should be able to give you a dashboard view
  that shows what blood pressures are normal when they go up, why they go up. Do they
  go up at night? Do they go up during the day? Do they go up after a meal? That would
  give you some real insight into how to care for that patient.”\n\nDr. Kvedar cautions
  that seeing this all become a reality with physicians is dependent on solving more
  than just the problems of data overload and dashboards. Here are two other important
  dependencies to be aware of.\n\n>\"If you call it decision support, maybe you can
  sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary.\" - Dr. Kvedar\n\n- **The timing
  of value-based reimbursement.** “We sort of had a rhythm going under the Obama Administration.
  Will that change? Not sure. Medicare has produced a plan that 50% of payments by
  two years from now will be value-based. So they seem to be on that curve. Many plans
  are now doing this but the rate is to be determined. As that happens, the reason
  we did medical home across our system is because of value-based payments and it
  makes much more sense in that context.”\n- **Physician resistance to the idea of
  AI.** “On the one hand, we do this in the EMR with decision support. So if you call
  it decision support, maybe you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary.
  It sounds like you are trying to take my job away from me, so I think it is how
  you frame it. And, of course, there's the liability issue that goes along with that
  and how you convince docs into a state where they are not afraid they are going
  to get sued because there was a data point that they didn't see that didn't go right
  in the algorithm.” \n\n##How far off is the future? \nDr. Kvedar concludes, “The
  pieces of connected health are here today, but we still have to put them together.
  Some of that will be technical. A lot of it will be business model. Some of it is
  even societal.”\n\nMake sure to listen to the [complete podcast interview with Dr.
  Kvedar](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/joseph-kvedar/) for many more insights about
  connected health, including a look at telemedicine and artificial intelligence."

  :summary: When we look at a more connected healthcare system, few see it as clearly
    as Joseph Kvedar, MD, author of _The Internet of Healthy Things_. In this podcast,
    he reveals which pieces of the healthcare industry have embraced connected health
    and which will have to be dragged to the party. Getting insights from Dr. Kvedar
    is like Googling the future of healthcare.
  :key_takeaways: "1. Discover which industry participants are embracing a more connected
    healthcare and which are not\n2. Learn why raw numbers don’t motivate a lifestyle
    change for some segments of the population \n3. Understand why societal changes
    will be the most difficult barrier to connected health\n4. Explore why feedback
    loops are fairly weak motivators "
  :post: "***Dr. Kvedar responds:***\n\n**On connected health and who will be last
    to board the train:** \"The slowest to come on board from a business model perspective
    are docs and hospitals because we are used to making a living by taking care of
    sick people – we haven't quite figured out how to reward clinicians for keeping
    you well and how to reward hospitals for keeping you out of hospitals.\" \n\n\"As
    I said earlier, doctors and hospitals are going to be dragged along to the party
    without question. Health plans, pharmacy, pharmaceuticals, and other industries
    are getting in ahead of the curve because they have more to gain in the short
    term. It's happening – doctors and hospitals are very slow to change.\"\n\n**On
    the current state of digital health:** \"Digital health is now adopted by more
    than 50% of U.S. citizens or something like that. While we are trying to celebrate
    the consumerization and the adoption... there is still a very significant chunk
    of folks — most of them with chronic illness who cost the system a lot of money
    — who are reticent.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/\" title=\"Kvedar,

    barriers to others entering their space and that means that they are doing something
    proprietary to keep you as a customer. Almost always that involves some sort of
    unique dataset or some sort of unique way of sharing data. On the vendor side,
    it seems hopeless.\"\n\n\"On the hospital side, from a pure business perspective,
    why would my hospital want to make it easy for patients to take their data to
    another hospital and get their care done there? To implement interoperability
    costs a lot of money. You have to build interfaces and interfaces are complicated.\"\n\n**On
    what will get us to interoperable healthcare:** \"The only way I could conceive

    that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.\"\n\n**On retail and
    its guiding light to healthcare:** \"Other examples have come up that I think
    are equally interesting, such as, if you buy an item from J.Crew online and, if
    you have their app on your phone, go into their mall store, the app will signal
    you to go to a table that has matching accessories to the thing that you bought
    online. A very interesting application.\" \n\n**On the wearable market downturn:**
    \"I think one of the reasons we are seeing a slump in the market is that there's
    a shiny new toy aspect to any new technology and we've gone through that phase
    with many wearables.\"\n\n![Kvedar, 'The Internet of Healthy Things' Symposium

    largely were designed by engineers for engineers, and by quantitative people for
    quantitative people. I fell in love with all of them initially. A friend of mine

  :summary: 'The health internet of things (health IoT) is essentially what most people
    in the industry today describe as connected health. '
  :blog_lead: 'There''s a new research [report](http://research.gigaom.com/report/the-internet-of-things-and-the-future-of-health-care/)
    by GigaOM about what they call the "health internet of things" (health IoT), which
    is essentially what most people in the industry today describe as "connected health".
    It''s inclusive of devices, sensors, apps and other tools that can track an individual''s
    activity and the other data on that individual. The report delves into the potential
    and power of that data, specifically the power of that data as it relates to health
    and wellness and the healthcare industry more broadly. The report''s worth reading
    if you haven''t see it.

'
  :post: |+
    The author [Jody Ranck](https://twitter.com/jranck) is well respected in the industry and he did a very nice job with the report, laying out in pretty good detail the case for the health IoT and connected health. It includes a lot of good case studies in it. To me, there are several key things which Jody calls out in the report that are worth highlighting.

    The first insight is obvious, namely that sensors and individual tracking present huge opportunities in terms of the volume and the value of data on individuals. Connected sensors and devices will dramatically expand data points and dimensions on individuals, providing more value than what has traditionally been captured and used in healthcare.

    The second insight is that data alone doesn't do that much; but, creating intelligent algorithms can. Using health IoT data + algorithms to drive behavior change and shape programs to improve access to health and wellness services is exceptionally valuable.

    The third insight is that connected health has largely not been associated with the power and the future of personalized medicine. To date, genomics has held the monopoly on that "personalized medicine", and with good reason. The argument in the report for personalized medicine is that, through connected health devices and the data they generate, we will have insights into environmental, behavioral, and social data for an individual. Those contexts for an individuals are extremely powerful for a lot of reasons, but one of the major areas that could benefit is healthcare and wellness.

    The last point that Jody makes in the report is that there is extreme power and value in combining health IoT data from multiple devices with data from clinical systems. This existing data is present in troves in the industry today. It's just locked up behind walls and in silos. But those silos are being pried open through Meaningful Use and patient access initiatives.

    Tied closely to mashing up of health IoT data with existing clinical data are issues of trust, security, and privacy. Patient device companies, via things like pedometers and home scales, have not traditionally had to worry about compliance. Healthcare is a risk averse industry that is highly regulated, and errs on the side of caution, especially if data from patient devices is merging with clinical data and/or being used to inform care.

    We firmly agree with the report that there are paradigm shifts coming to healthcare, and a lot of those shifts are going to be technology and data-driven; but, in order for those shifts to take hold, in order for those shifts to scale, both on the consumer side as well as on the enterprise side, there needs to be a high level of security. There also needs to be transparency into the policies and procedures that manage that security. This is essential to provide the assurances needed for both individuals as well as enterprises that will be using these technologies.

    This [security and transparency is in the core](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliance/) of how we build our technology at Datica. It's in our DNA. It's the compliance and security layer that we want to help vendors, enterprises, and developers address so that they can focus on creating meaningful health IoT applications or the actionable insights or algorithms based on health IoT data. Whether you're building a mobile app using our [compliant cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) or deploying a custom application on our [compliant platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/), we want to help you build and sell the future of healthcare.
