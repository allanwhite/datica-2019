:summary: An overwhelming majority of patients are already sharing data or would be
  willing to share data with providers and motivated patients are a very good thing.
:blog_lead: There's a recent report and [infographic](http://www.mobiquityinc.com/get-mobile-get-healthy-appification-health-fitness-infographic)
  that surveyed over a thousand consumers and asked them questions related to tracking
  their own health, searching for health information online, and about sharing health
  data about themselves with healthcare providers. The report found that an overwhelming
  majority are already sharing data or would be willing to share data with providers.
  That's fantastic! Motivated patients are a very good thing.
:post: |2+

  This is a trend that the health system should encourage and help foster. Interesting, to me at least, is that the report found that 70% of the people that shared data with providers thought providers were interested in the patient reported data. That finding surprises me because it doesn't fit into the way that the vast majority of providers deliver, document, and get reimbursed for care today. With very limited time per patient visit, going through tons of new data is not always feasible or encouraged. Self tracking is exactly in line with the goals of healthcare in terms of patient engagement and ownership of patient health. If individuals are actively measuring and quantifying themselves and they want to share that information, it should be encouraged to create a return on that individual investment and effort.

  I have personal experiences with family that have wanted to share their own data and been blown off by physicians. An example is my dad. We got him an iPhone-connected glucometer a couple years ago and, in his excitement, he emailed his endocrinologist his data ahead of an appointment. The endocrinologist flat out told him that he couldn't really use the data. My dad now sends me his weekly reports of blood sugars, which is helpful because I can encourage him but it would be great if his physician supported and encouraged his enthusiasm for self-care.

  The second piece of that report found that those individuals, the ones who want to share data, also want to have trust in the way that the data is being shared, and the [security and privacy of their data](https://datica.com/blog/onramp-to-the-healthcare-cloud/). I think that most people today are leery of security and privacy because there have been so many high profile and public breaches and violations. There's a lot of concern about who's selling data to whom and what type of data is actually protected on individuals. This is much, much broader than healthcare.

  The fact that a large chunk of people would like to share information that they're tracking about themselves, they'd like to share that information with their providers is something that, as a health system, I think we need to find a way to integrate that one way or the other.

  The data in the infographic also shows trends that innovators and vendors should enable and capitalize upon. First, creating ways for consumers to easily collect and combine information about their activity and daily routine is incredibly valuable. There are countless sensors and apps so this is a crowded space to jump into. Second, creating tools that leverage that data to provide intelligent feedback to individuals is needed. This is an area that more companies are trying to get into, but is still pretty open. Third, enabling the easy sharing of personal data while maintaining the privacy and security of that data is essential to consumer trust and health system buy-in. This is harder, and there is still much to be figured out. Where is data going? Is it using traditional interfaces or [new EHR APIs](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-fuels-transformation-at-hospitals/)? How is it secured and can it pass the compliance officer? And fourth, though this is implied in 1 through 3 above, would be standardizing the data formats to make it easier for data to be exchanged. So many opportunities....

  :summary: 'FHIR is a necessary development due to the current state of healthcare
    integration and interoperability and brings a better, more modern approach to
    ehr integrations. '
  :blog_lead: "As you may have heard, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
    is the new and emerging standard being developed under the [Health Language 7](https://hl7.org/)
    (HL7) organization and Datica has just released THREE new Academy articles so
    you can stay ahead of the curve on all things FHIR related. \n"
  :post: "Pronounced as ‘Fire’ (hopefully bringing clarity to the pun in the title),
    it was initially developed by [Graham Grieve](http://www.healthintersections.com.au/),
    who insisted upon FHIR being open sourced.\n\nIn our [Introduction to FHIR](https://datica.com/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    Academy article, Datica Co-founder Mohan Balachandran, guides us through why FHIR
    was necessary due to the current state of healthcare integration and interoperability
    and why FHIR brings a better, more modern approach with concepts such as [Restful
    APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and accompanying
    documentation to integration systems. In this introduction, you will learn what
    makes FHIR the superior in flexibility, the advantages FHIR has over the existing
    HL7 standards, and where FHIR is headed from here.\n\nIn the second entry to our
    FHIR series, [The FHIR Resource Object: The Core Building Block](https://datica.com/academy/the-fhir-resource-object-the-core-building-block/),
    Mohan guides us through an understanding of the Resource object outlining its
    origins and intent, but also providing resources to further expand our HL7 comprehension.
    By listing various resource categories and their structures, including clinical,
    administrative, and infrastructure, Mohan is able to show how these models allow
    for the creation of nearly any clinical condition. \n\nStill want to know more
    about FHIR? We sure hope so as Mohan’s third entry, [Recommended FHIR API Implementation](https://datica.com/academy/recommended-fhir-api-implementation-principles/)
    shows the general design principles that we have followed at [Datica](https://datica.com/managed-integration/)
    and what the key underlying principles are when building RESTful APIs.\n\nAs always,
    Datica is here to be your trusted resource and partner in all aspects of HL7.
    Stay tuned for more [Academy entries](https://datica.com/academy/) as we stay
    up to date on the latest in digital health.\n"

  :summary: 'The health internet of things (health IoT) is essentially what most people
    in the industry today describe as connected health. '
  :blog_lead: 'There''s a new research [report](http://research.gigaom.com/report/the-internet-of-things-and-the-future-of-health-care/)
    by GigaOM about what they call the "health internet of things" (health IoT), which
    is essentially what most people in the industry today describe as "connected health".
    It''s inclusive of devices, sensors, apps and other tools that can track an individual''s
    activity and the other data on that individual. The report delves into the potential
    and power of that data, specifically the power of that data as it relates to health
    and wellness and the healthcare industry more broadly. The report''s worth reading
    if you haven''t see it.

'
  :post: |+
    The author [Jody Ranck](https://twitter.com/jranck) is well respected in the industry and he did a very nice job with the report, laying out in pretty good detail the case for the health IoT and connected health. It includes a lot of good case studies in it. To me, there are several key things which Jody calls out in the report that are worth highlighting.

    The first insight is obvious, namely that sensors and individual tracking present huge opportunities in terms of the volume and the value of data on individuals. Connected sensors and devices will dramatically expand data points and dimensions on individuals, providing more value than what has traditionally been captured and used in healthcare.

    The second insight is that data alone doesn't do that much; but, creating intelligent algorithms can. Using health IoT data + algorithms to drive behavior change and shape programs to improve access to health and wellness services is exceptionally valuable.

    The third insight is that connected health has largely not been associated with the power and the future of personalized medicine. To date, genomics has held the monopoly on that "personalized medicine", and with good reason. The argument in the report for personalized medicine is that, through connected health devices and the data they generate, we will have insights into environmental, behavioral, and social data for an individual. Those contexts for an individuals are extremely powerful for a lot of reasons, but one of the major areas that could benefit is healthcare and wellness.

    The last point that Jody makes in the report is that there is extreme power and value in combining health IoT data from multiple devices with data from clinical systems. This existing data is present in troves in the industry today. It's just locked up behind walls and in silos. But those silos are being pried open through Meaningful Use and patient access initiatives.

    Tied closely to mashing up of health IoT data with existing clinical data are issues of trust, security, and privacy. Patient device companies, via things like pedometers and home scales, have not traditionally had to worry about compliance. Healthcare is a risk averse industry that is highly regulated, and errs on the side of caution, especially if data from patient devices is merging with clinical data and/or being used to inform care.

    We firmly agree with the report that there are paradigm shifts coming to healthcare, and a lot of those shifts are going to be technology and data-driven; but, in order for those shifts to take hold, in order for those shifts to scale, both on the consumer side as well as on the enterprise side, there needs to be a high level of security. There also needs to be transparency into the policies and procedures that manage that security. This is essential to provide the assurances needed for both individuals as well as enterprises that will be using these technologies.

    This [security and transparency is in the core](https://datica.com/compliance/) of how we build our technology at Datica. It's in our DNA. It's the compliance and security layer that we want to help vendors, enterprises, and developers address so that they can focus on creating meaningful health IoT applications or the actionable insights or algorithms based on health IoT data. Whether you're building a mobile app using our [compliant cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) or deploying a custom application on our [compliant platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/), we want to help you build and sell the future of healthcare.

  :blog_lead: 'In this second entry of our [Assessment Series](https://datica.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-assessment/)
    we explore what a HIPAA Risk Assessment is and why it is crucial in ensuring the
    safe-handling of [protected health information (PHI)](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-protected-health-information-or-phi/)
    with the growing dependency on information technology in the Healthcare Industry
    and the implementation of electronic medical records (EMR).

'
  :post: "Back in February of 2009 the [HITECH (Health Information Technology for
    Economic and Clinical Health)](https://datica.com/blog/data-security-patient-engagement/)
    Act was passed as an element of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to
    fortify the privacy and safety of PHI by including provisions to the HIPAA Standards.
    Among the stipulations in HITECH was the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    which has requirements organized into three classifications, and within each classification
    are 18 standards and 36 implementation specifications that are categorized as
    “Required” or “Addressable”. The **Required** specifications are crucial and necessities
    to be implemented; whereas, **Addressable** specifications are meant for scalable
    consideration based on individual and entity needs and best practices. \n\n##
    The Three Classifications \n\n## 1. Administrative Safeguards\nThese constitute
    more than half of the HIPAA Security Assessment requirements. As with all three
    standards, compliance will mandate an evaluation of the security controls in place
    already, a precise and in-depth analysis, and a succession of documented solutions
    derived from a multitude of factors unique to each covered body.\n\nThese safeguards
    are broken down as follows:\n\n### Standard: Security Management Process\nThe
    intent is to create the administrative processes and operations that a covered
    body will utilize to enact the security program in its environment.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Risk Analysis (Required)\n2. Risk Management (Required)\n3.
    Sanction Policy (Required)\n4. Information System Activity Review (Required)\n\n###
    Standard: Assigned Security Responsibility\nThe goal is to recognize who will
    hold responsibility for ensuring that the covered body abides by the HIPAA Security
    Rule. There are no implementation standards for this standard.\n\n### Standard:
    Workforce Security\nThe objective is to identify each workforce member that necessitates
    access to ePHI and their need, time of need, and how they are going to control
    access to the information. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Authorization
    and/or Supervision (Addressable)\n2. Workforce Clearance Procedure (Addressable)\n3.
    Termination Procedures (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Information Access Management\nMeant
    to restrict access to solely persons with a need for specified ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Isolating Health Care Clearinghouse Functions (Required)\n2.
    Access Authorization (Addressable)\n3. Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable)\n\n###
    Standard: Security Awareness and Training\nTraining for all new and current members
    of the entity’s staff is mandated by the Security Rule.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Security Reminders (Addressable)\n2. Protection from Malicious
    Software (Addressable)\n3. Log-in Monitoring (Addressable)\n4. Password Monitoring
    (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Security Incident Procedures\nImplemented to call
    attention to security occurrences within the covered body’s environment. \n\n####
    Implementation Specifications\n1. Response and Reporting\n\n### Standard: Contingency
    Plan\nNecessitates to plan and establish strategies for retrieving access to ePHI
    if an entity where to experience a crisis or occurrence that disrupts urgent business
    operations.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Data Backup Plan (Required)\n2.
    Disaster Recovery Plan (Required)\n3. Emergency Mode Operation Plan (Required)\n4.
    Testing and Revision Procedures (Addressable)\n5. Applications and Data Criticality
    Analysis (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Evaluation\nRequires entities to create
    a process to review and maintain standard security measures to comply with The
    Security Rule. There are no implementation specifications for this standard.\n\n###
    Standard: Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements\nStates that covered
    bodies are required to sign a contract or other agreement that meet the definition
    of a “business associate.” This standard has no implementation specifications.\n\n##
    2. Physical Safeguards\nThese safeguards are meant to evaluate and implement all
    physical access to ePHI.\n\nThese are broken down as follows within a HIPAA Security
    Assessment:\n\n### Standard: Facility Access Controls\nEnacted to limit the access
    to the electronic information systems where ePHI is housed.\n\n#### Implementation
    Specifications\n1. Contingency Operations (Addressable)\n2. Facility Security
    Plan (Addressable)\n3. Access Control and Validation Procedures (Addressable)\n4.
    Maintenance Records (Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Workstation Use\nRequires that
    entities clarify the proper uses to be done by electronic computing devices. There
    are no implementation specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Workstation
    Security\nAddresses the operations and procedures for how workstations should
    be utilized and secured from unauthorized persons. There are no implementation
    specifications for this standard. \n\n### Standard: Device and Media Controls\nThis
    covers the correct handling of electronic media including removal, receipt, backup,
    storage, reuse, disposal, and responsibility. \n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1.
    Disposal (Required)\n2. Media Re-Use (Required)\n3. Accountability (Addressable)\n4.
    Data Backup and Storage (Addressable)\n\n## 3. Technical Safeguards\nA covered
    body is mandated to determine the security protocol and specified technologies
    that are appropriate for implementing in its organization while complying with
    these safeguards which are broken down according to the HIPAA Security Assessment
    as follows:\n\n### Standard: Access Control\nRequired to provide/restrict persons
    with the access necessary for the information systems, applications, programs,
    or files associated with ePHI.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Unique
    User Identification (Required)\n2. Emergency Access Procedure (Required)\n3. Automatic
    Logoff (Addressable)\n4. Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)\n\n### Standard:
    Audit Controls\nThis standard is meant to be useful for the records and examinations
    of information system activity, particularly in a security violation.This standard
    has no implementation specifications.\n\n### Standard: Integrity\nThis standard
    requires that policies and processes are implemented to protect ePHI from being
    altered or destroyed.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Mechanism to Authenticate
    Electronic Protected Health Information(Addressable)\n\n### Standard: Person or
    Entity Authentication\nThis standard confirms that a person is who they are claiming
    to be before being granted the access to ePHI. This standard has no implementation
    specifications.\n\n### Standard: Transmission Security\nThis standard is utilized
    to guard against those who are not granted permissions to ePHI that is being communicated
    over electronic means.\n\n#### Implementation Specifications\n1. Integrity Controls
    (Addressable)\n2. Encryption (Addressable)\n\nIn summary, when doing your own
    HIPAA Security Assessment, keep in mind that this applies to all media types including
    oral, paper, and electronic while simultaneously considering integrity, confidentiality,
    and availability. There are many HIPAA Security Assessment tools and services
    that have been released but no one is more highly regarded in this space than
    Datica as a [HIPAA compliance authority](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/).
