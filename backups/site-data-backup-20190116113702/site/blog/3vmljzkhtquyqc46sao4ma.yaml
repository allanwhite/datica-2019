:blog_lead: |-
  HIMSS is only a week away! On Tuesday, March 6th, Datica is presenting on the topic of HITRUST in the AWS booth #1625.

  AWS asked us to share our knowledge of HITRUST with their customers, or those organizations interested in being AWS customers, in a special 20-minute session held at 11:00 am. We are excited for the opportunity to break down the fundamentals of HITRUST on AWS, and then give advice to attendees on their own journey towards HITRUST certification.
:post: "\nHITRUST is becoming one of the most important pivot points for any enterprise
  healthcare cloud strategy. We've seen this first hand ourselves, time and time again.\n\nInnovative
  health IT programs typically face three blockers when trying to adopt AWS:\n\n1.
  **Internal IT closely guards available resources.** They push projects to internally
  owned and managed hard drives and CPU cores. When moving to the cloud, those initiatives
  can be viewed as \"Shadow IT\" because of the DevOps and cloud engineering resources
  needed outside of their control.\n\n2. **Internal Compliance does not approve of
  the low levels of liability taken on by AWS.** Under AWS's [Shared Responsibility
  Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), roughly
  1/10th of compliance controls are taken on by them (mostly the physical level and
  firewall). The other 9/10ths are major gaps that are now the organization's responsibility.
  Not cool in their book.\n\n3. **Internal Security is often aligned with Internal
  Compliance.** They view a presence on AWS as a new threat vector. While AWS themselves
  have some of the best infrastructure security measures in the world, the operating
  system level is still the responsibility now of the organization to secure. That's
  a lot of work and a lot of liability! Typically it's a problem requiring hard-to-find
  resources like cloud engineers—a luxury in health IT.\n\nAll combined, most healthcare
  enterprises are blocked from adopting AWS. David Deas, Corporate Director of Innovation
  and Knowledge Analytics at Method Le Bonheur, articulated this exact pain while
  giving a talk at last year's re:Invent conference:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"
  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;
  encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Enter HITRUST, the on-ramp for
  AWS\n\nFor the David Deas's of the world, HITRUST has been a godsend.\n\nFor three
  years in a row, Datica has been Stage 3 CSF Certified on top of AWS. Our Platform
  absorbs all liabilities for compliance **on** the cloud, which extends AWS's excellent
  coverage for compliance **of** the cloud. \n\n![Datica Shared Responsibility Model](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3lcfH25St2OysgsKCgc4Kk/f368d2e9d454a691098bdcd725b05271/Shared_Responsibilities.png)\n\nHealthcare
  enterprises have taken note. They look to Datica to give assurances to those three
  internal stakeholders, which in turn green light adoption of AWS for innovative
  projects.\n\n* Internal IT trusts Datica's cloud management, effectively eliminating
  the \"Shadow IT\" concern while simultaneously alleviating their burden to always
  \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" with hard drives and CPUs.\n\n* Internal Security and
  Internal Compliance both view HITRUST as the highest standard of security and compliance
  in the industry. By partnering with Datica, all their concerns go away.\n\nThe result
  is that people like David Deas who can get meaningful work done fast, are making
  a genuine impact on the lives of patients while reducing clinical costs.\n\n## Live
  presentation for those who can't make it at HIMSS\n\nIf you are not attending HIMSS
  this year, or if you are unable to make the 11:00 am time slot on Tuesday, March
  6th, we are holding a 30-minute webinar later in March to expand on Travis' presentation.
  Please join us if you can't visit us in person at HIMSS.\n\n[Visit our webinar overview

  :summary: Adam Leko and David Deas discussed how the Datica Platform helped Methodist
    Le Bonheur (MLH) health system get onto AWS through removing the burden of DevOps
    and security in a HITRUST CSF Certified way.
  :blog_lead: |-
    David Deas and Memphis Le Bonheur (MLH) have a mandate to improve patient care, improve the lives of clinicians, and save the organization money in the process.

    As a 20+ year veteran of healthcare and a computer scientist by trade, David knows a thing or two about how to get work done within the confines of healthcare's regulations or internal IT politics. He was the leader in implementing Cerner at MLH in the 90s. Now, in his role as head of innovation at MLH, he's charged with faster-paced objectives where speed-to-market is imperative.

    Internal IT has been less than helpful. On stage today, David spoke about the "Ticket Hell" he has to go through to provision any technical resources for his team.
  :post: |-
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oju3cVT5YBo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Internal IT will only ever budget the necessary compute cores and hard drives needed for what has been forecasted a year out. When fast-paced projects come online, it is always "robbing Peter to pay Paul," as David described.

    ![Datica-MLH-ReInvent-Process](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3Thp03koXKiWaA8qaa8Wq4/53073df4e6feeb9acdea9b28d276de7a/Datica-MLH-ReInvent.005.jpeg?w=1200)

    The cloud is a perfect solution for his team. Unfortunately, he faced a compounding resource problem: None of his team members were DevOps or security experts, and he would never be granted authority to hire for this skillset since it would become a "shadow IT" risk to the security group.

    In stepped Datica.

    As a [HITRUST CSF Certified](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) platform, any issues with trusting an external partner were immediately calmed. "Everyone at MLH put their weapons away and instead started to talk about how to solve problems," David said on stage to the audience.

    Datica helped David become a partner to the internal IT and internal security teams. "When I heard that Datica would take direct calls from my security group, I knew I found a partner who could help me be successful," he added.

    Because of how Datica removes the DevOps and DevSecOps burdens associated with putting workloads on the cloud, he didn't need to hire new staff members. His team of developers can spin up new containers and environments in a matter of minutes vs. months. They've already shipped more projects in 2017 while using Datica than they ever thought was  possible.

    ![AWS Datica 1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/5WvSbb3tUkkuwEaAQU6y6c/277750e586335f9f46bb63381fd7154f/AWS_Datica_1.jpg?w=1600)

    The session then turned to [Adam Leko, Datica's CTO & CISO](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/). Adam dived into the technical specifics of how the platform worked.

    After speaking to the technology we orchestrate in order to achieve HITRUST credibility, Adam spoke to the AWS primitives we enable. Of the 57 AWS Services, 27 are under their Business Associate Agreement. Almost all of the 27 are enabled via the Datica Platform. Adam spoke to the different services, like EC2, VPCs, and so on, but especially how those services are configured within an [enhanced shared responsibility model](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/aws-hipaa/).

    From there Adam shared the typical deployment model MLH's team uses to push their workloads to the Datica Platform and subsequently AWS.

    The session was greeted with a positive response. For those who came up after the session was over, thank you for your questions and feedback. For those we weren't able to talk to before the room was closed, you can find us at booth #519. We have team members here all week who can help answer any compliance or security questions on AWS.

  :blog_lead: It's the second day of [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
    and sessions are in full swing. I was able to attend several healthcare track
    sessions yesterday ([including Datica's](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/
    "Datica's AWS presentation")) and the future looks bright. Healthcare is poised
    to fully embrace the cloud in 2018. The sentiment in the market has changed and
    it truly feels like we're on the edge of a major shift in the approach healthcare
    organizations are taking when building and hosting their software.
  :post: |-
    Transitioning to today, the sessions were a bit different — but just as exciting. I attended three talks that discussed cutting edge fields that will have a major impact on healthcare in the next 5 to 10 years. Unlike healthcare's adoption of the cloud in 2018, these new technologies will likely take a bit longer, but that's not stopping us from getting excited.

    ![AWS services and partners](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/58k6RGB8ZOCOYA0eCqguaG/ded251d67b941cfce7ab20b66b4bde43/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__4_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The first session I attended was the __Global Partner Summit Keynote__, which was packed with several thousand attendees. We learned about several new initiatives and programs for Amazon Partners ([Datica is an APN member, as well as a healthcare competency partner](https://aws.amazon.com/health/healthcare-partners/#Datica)). These new changes will have a profound impact on how we work with our customers — from VPC sharing to new ways to integrate with the AWS marketplace. We'll be announcing new ways to take advantage of both Datica and AWS in the future.

    ![AWS Hyperledger Sawtooth Blockchain](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4rNlSQgtjaIuQYkUAI8iGU/7c052bd02b0d178e924d441a07801759/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__3_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    Session number two was entirely focused on [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSP-taqLWPQ) and blockchain technologies on AWS. We saw Intel present on [Sawtooth/Hyperledger](https://hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) (a competitor to [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)) which is governed by the Linux foundation. Healthcare veterans like PokitDok use Sawtooth to enable their blockchain technology, [DokChain](https://dokchain.com/). We're excited to watch blockchain technology grow within healthcare.

    ![AWS Neural networking](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6cDub9PA3KwQciuekA80IU/083cf25a67e696875daa420db63ea44e/Image_uploaded_from_iOS__2_.jpg?w=1200){:.tofigure}

    The last session of the day was on Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. This was by far the most exciting talk of the day. There are several real world use cases that make sense for both Datica and Datica customers. From menial tasks like filling out 1500+ question security questionnaires, to providing smart analytics and predictive scoring for compliance, machine learning is a very real topic that we're exploring deeply at Datica.

    If you were in attendance for any of the these sessions and want to chat about AI, Blockchain or how Datica provides an unparalleled compliance experience on AWS, stop by booth #519.

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

  :lead: "Amazon Web Services (AWS) + Datica are a match made in HIPAA compliance
    heaven. Developers can deploy application workloads to their Datica environment
    instead of directly to AWS to eliminate the burden of compliance. With the Datica
    Platform, you get all the great benefits of AWS as the foundation our platform,
    plus Datica automates all DevOps and DevSecOps requirements on the cloud. With
    AWS + Datica, developers can deploy AWS services & workloads in minutes that are
    fully in compliance with HIPAA and HITRUST. \n\nThis resource page is meant to

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica
    workflow diagram AWS](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/3mxh8k3ZGwiUQce862ga2Q/1e86d891b61168f5f20c0814c8e74da0/Datica_workflow_diagram_AWS_2x.png)](https://assets.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/4Qokvx5TskWwCWwGQk0wM/8304e9c351e19a1eb9eb8790f6d269a3/Datica_workflow_diagram.pdf)\n\nIf
    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
    [BAA from Datica](https://policy.datica.com/#23.-datica-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-(\"baa\")).
    \n\nAligning Business Associate Agreements amongst all technology partners is
    a full-time job. You sign one BAA with Datica to cover the entirety of compliance
    in the cloud, including AWS HIPAA compliance."
