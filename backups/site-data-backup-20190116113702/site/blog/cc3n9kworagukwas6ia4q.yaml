:summary: 'Innovators in healthcare face a common dilemma: New technologies and tech-enabled
  services need to provide an ROI in two drastically different health systems.'
:blog_lead: 'Clayton Christensen coined the phrase "innovators dilemma" in his aptly
  named [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) with the same
  title. He went on to co-author a book specifically addressing opportunities for
  innovation and disruption in healthcare. Both of those books are worth reading.
  Though not specifically a subject of either book, we''ve uncovered, time and time
  again, that innovators in healthcare face a common dilemma. The dilemma, highlighted
  in our Innovation Series [interview with Dr. Mark Chasin](https://datica.com/innovation/marc-chasin-md/)
  and our interview with iTriage co-founder [Dr. Wayne Guerra](https://datica.com/innovation/wayne-guerra-md-mba/),
  is that new technologies and tech-enabled services in healthcare need to provide
  an ROI in two drastically different health systems - 1) our current, still dominant,
  volume-based system (fee for service) and 2) our fast growing, but still minority,
  value-based system (accountable care).

'
:post: "I remember hearing members of the HCA executive team discussing this same
  topic a few years ago at a conference. HCA is a massive, for-profit health system,
  and has money to invest in new technology (it has a venture fund and also recently
  [acquired PatientKeeper](http://www.patientkeeper.com/news_events/press_release.html?id=22834)),
  but it also realizes what keeps the lights on today - volume of care, or more care,
  not less. On the panel executives at HCA talked about how they fully realized the
  direction healthcare incentives are going but also know where those incentives are
  today. They talked about investing and planning for a different health system future
  so the organization would be prepared to basically flip a switch when the scales
  tip in favor of value over volume. Not all organizations have the resources to prepare
  this way.\r\n\r\nHealthcare, despite being a massive industry, does not have high
  margins. At least most provider organizations don't have high margins. Putting current
  provider revenue at risk by making the system more efficient (less duplicate testing,
  reduced readmissions and ED visits, etc), while probably the *right* thing to do,
  could close the already small gaps hospitals have between revenue and costs. Thus,
  healthcare innovators, both inside and outside the enterprise, need to find ways
  to help keep the lights on today while preparing systems for tomorrow as they go
  about building new technologies and tech-enabled services.\r\n\r\nWhile not always
  easily done, there are a few examples we've seen of successfully adding value today
  while fitting very well with the incentives of tomorrow. In some cases, it's simply
  a matter of choosing the right target areas (conditions, episodes, etc) and messaging.\r\n\r\n*
  *Bundled payments.* Bundled payments [align value and quality with reimbursement](http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/bundled-payments/).
  For select procedures, health systems can elect to receive a certain amount, a bundle,
  of payment for each patient. The health systems succeed when the care they provide
  limits follow-up and complications, ultimately lowering their cost and improving
  the quality of care. Services that enable this, such as [Healthloop](http://healthloop.com/),
  are well placed to expand beyond bundled payments when health systems begin to feel
  the broader pressure of more risk in payer contracts. \r\n\r\n* *Readmission prevention.*
  This is similar to bundled payments. Technology and services that [reduce the number
  of readmissions](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html),
  for certain conditions, protect health systems from penalties. The goal is preventing
  readmission within the first 30 days of discharge. Beyond 30 days, there's good
  data that a large percentage of patients are readmitted within 60 days, 90 days,
  180 days, and within 1 year of readmission. In an accountable care world, services
  with a foothold preventing readmissions can expand to prevent extended readmissions,
  or maybe just admissions, that would cost the system.\r\n\r\n* *Concierge medicine
  / direct primary care (DPC).* There are a few aspects of subscription-based medicine
  (concierge or DPC) that align with trends coming to healthcare. The first is that
  subscription medicine has incentives to keep patients happy so they don't churn,
  or leave the practices. Unlike most of healthcare today, customer service matters
  here. The second reason is that subscription medicine is largely provided by primary
  care providers. These providers work hard to prevent catastrophic, or really any
  form, or expensive care because many patients that use subscription medicine have
  high deductible insurance plans.\r\n\r\n* *Analytics.* This is a broad bucket with
  many meanings. In the future, analytics will ideally help to reduce the cost of
  care while improving the quality of care. Today, analytics can be used to suggest
  and maximize covered (reimbursed) care, increasing revenue for health systems. In
  doing so, theses services overcome hurdles of access to data and can easily flip
  from promoting more care to reducing the amount of care, or appropriating care to
  the right populations.\r\n\r\n* *Telemedicine.* Telemedicine represents a major
  shift in the way care is delivered. Today it can be used to generate new revenue
  from patients willing to pay out of pocket for convenience or to make systems more
  competitive for certain desirable populations. In the future it can be used to reduce
  the cost of care for accountable care patients and maybe even prevent more expensive
  forms of care.\r\n\r\n* *Patient portals.* Patient portals address a core requirement
  of Meaningful Use (MU) by providing patients with access to their medical records.
  Today this helps health systems get incentives from the government. In the future,
  these portals can be used to expand services to patients and *maybe* become the
  hubs for patients accessing digital health services. That's a big *maybe*.\r\n\r\nThere
  are undoubtedly more examples. We'd love to hear from you about the ones we missed,
  or from those with experience selling ROI today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\n"

  :summary: Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
    key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
    epic transformations.
  :blog_lead: 'Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
    key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
    epic transformations. Today’s healthcare CIO can come from a myriad of backgrounds
    since IT is no longer a prerequisite for the position. Rather than a technical
    nature, a business-oriented mindset is crucial in order for healthcare CIOs to
    be strategic and manage the system’s financial metrics. With the healthcare industry
    shifting gears and the CIOs no longer narrowly focusing on the technology, what
    is included in the scope of work for the modern healthcare CIO?

'
  :post: "## Population Health Management\n\nForward-thinking healthcare leaders have
    been actively pursuing population health management objectives. These objectives
    pertain to some of the most challenging cohorts that the twenty-first-century
    CIO has fully embraced. Proven solutions show that data analytics play a vital
    role in providing insight into individuals and populations, assuring that standardized,
    actionable, and substantial healthcare delivery information is received. The CIO
    of healthcare systems has the power to leverage influence to shift the quality
    of human health across entire segments of the population. The key challenges faced
    involve data: patient ascertainment, stratification, and analytics for exertions
    or interventions. \n\n## Strategic Interoperability\n\nA lot of buzz around interoperability
    has been happening since 2013 and for justifiable cause. Interoperability addresses
    some of healthcare’s most pressing plights so the demand for achieving interoperability
    is only on the rise. Despite this severe imposition, most healthcare organizations
    have only begun their journey to achieving interoperability. \n\nIntegration engines
    are what most healthcare organizations currently use to enable simplistic messaging
    between systems. This fits the homogenous nature of the [HL7v2](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/)
    standard. Having your integration capabilities entirely behind the hospital's
    firewall is no longer enough as interoperability requires a more strategic stance.
    These organizations need an interoperability solution that can facilitate strategic
    growth plans through acquisitions and mergers. Interoperability not only has become
    an industry-level issue but is also a prerequisite for success in other healthcare
    initiatives such as coordinated care, patient engagement, and [enterprise innovation](https://datica.com/innovation/).
    \n\n## Big Data Analytics\n\nIn the CIO’s domain, an ever-growing scope of data
    is overseen, distributed among multiple divergent systems, both in structured
    and unstructured configurations. Never seen before, content from social media
    and text messages can be found in a patient’s health record, contributing to the
    volume, momentum, and diversity of data. With all of the latest technologies in
    mobile devices, physician dashboards, telehealth, etc., CIOs are faced with one
    of the greatest HIT challenges of aggregating, normalizing, and integrating all
    of that Big Data down to the actionable direction at the time of care. CIOs are
    being looked upon to make this data interoperable, support engagement, and coerce
    the proper exploits by understanding the data from a technical and cultural framework.

  :summary: Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population
    at a significantly reduced cost is the basis for innovation of most healthcare
    systems.
  :blog_lead: "Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population
    at a significantly reduced cost is the ultimate dream of most healthcare systems.
    [Innovation](https://datica.com/innovation/) is the key to being able to provide
    that healthcare excellence but there are socioeconomic needs that need to be addressed
    first. The healthcare innovation model has been largely driven by copious amounts
    of research and development to construct new technologies and processes, which
    can prove to be very costly. Healthcare spending is already skyrocketing as more
    Americans are getting sicker, so just as there is a desire for disruptive technologies,
    a disruptive approach to innovation is warranted. Frugal innovation will be the
    approach that delivers more social and economic benefits while utilizing fewer
    resources and promoting affordability, sustainability, accessibility, and quality.
    \n"
  :post: "\nFrugal innovation, falling in sync with the industry’s transition from
    volume to value care, will mandate a preference towards simplicity over sophistication.
    Healthcare solutions that are easier to use are more accessible, demand little
    maintenance, and are less expensive. Sometimes the simplest ideas truly are the
    best. It pays to also consider what is already applicable in a patient’s present
    environment, so review what technologies and processes could potentially be repurposed
    to solve another existing need. This will allow you to compensate for what is
    scarce with what is abundant. Providers should be exercising their already existing
    resources, like mobile and satellite connectivity, to deliver care better, faster,
    and cheaper. \n\nPublic and private sectors of healthcare need to collaborate
    together to increase their community impact. Amalgamating knowledge and networks
    will allow for further reach into any endeavor. Healthcare pockets of excellence
    will stay just that, assisting a small portion of populations instead of providing
    support to those who could truly benefit from the advancements. Adopting a collaboration
    [solution platform](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) that will allow for higher
    engagement from professionals and patients alike to fix what needs fixing. Ultimately,
    co-operating between sectors will allow for frugal innovation to take place resulting
    in co-creation of sustainable and affordable health solutions that benefit a larger
    populace. \n"

  :summary: 'These big ideas in healthcare innovation explore a lack of interoperability,
    the role of EHRs, and how data standards like FHIR ignite transformation. '
  :blog_lead: "Connectedness is the final frontier for healthcare. In many ways, the
    true breakthrough for innovation will come once interoperability becomes the default
    instead of the barrier it has been for several decades. With that focus, we recently
    compiled the six biggest ideas from the 2016 Datica Healthcare Innovation Series
    into a [third annual report](https://datica.com/innovation/2016/). The report
    explores the history behind the lack of interoperability, the role EHRs play,
    and what new data standards, like FHIR, can do ignite true transformation. \n\nSince
    2014, this continuing [interview series](https://datica.com/innovation/) has sought
    to understand how innovation happens in healthcare. Nine of the greatest minds
    in healthcare share their insights about data standards and integration principles
    in the complete 2016 annual report. These six ideas are a summation of the thoughts
    in the report."
  :post: "## Six Big Ideas\n\n### 1. Innovation is a global endeavor. \n\n> “If you
    talk only to yourself, you stay the way you are... If you talk only to others
    in healthcare, you move with the pack... It’s only if you talk outside of your
    domain that you can leap boundaries.” — Mark Smith, MD\n\nOne truth about new
    ideas is they are typically the combination of existing ideas. Therefore the greatest
    innovations are spurred by bumping together diverse thinkers with diverse backgrounds.
    The more this happens, the higher probability true innovation will occur. The
    takeaway: global minds, often outside of healthcare, are some of the best sources
    of healthcare innovation at the national level.\n\n### 2. Part of the challenge
    of technology adoption is due to the difficulty in understanding and absorbing
    the technology.\n\n> “When I talk to implementors in the FHIR community about
    this, there’s this thing that goes around about RESTful APIs — the 5-5-5 rule
    — 5 seconds to find the API, 5 minutes to understand what it was doing and 5 hours
    to have something working. But to that I add, 5 years to begin to understand healthcare.”
    — Grahame Grieve \n\nWhether it’s the native complexity of the standard or the
    poor documentation that is behind the times, traditional data standards have not
    been inviting to energetic entrepreneurial problem solvers. The barrier to adoption
    is a subtle yet underrated consideration when wondering why interoperability isn’t
    better than its current state. The good news: FHIR tries to tackle this problem
    head on.\n\n### 3. The pace of FHIR adoption has been insanely fast (by healthcare
    standards). \n> ”[FHIR has] reached a point of adoption where there is enough
    critical mass to ensure that its APIs can be the standard and the usefulness of
    the platform can be assured.” -Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD\n\nHealthcare is rightfully
    skeptical of the hot newness. For decades it has been told what new technology
    or process will save the day. While FHIR doesn’t solve all the problems, there
    is an industry view that FHIR truly is a breakthrough moment on interoperability.
    The data behind the swelling sentiment is the rate of adoption across sub-domains,
    across vendors, and across use cases, as well as being embraced by the government.\n\n###
    4. More data is not necessarily the answer to innovation because it’s often useless
    data. \n> “Doctors are rightfully skeptical in getting all your Fitbit or whatnot
    data because it doesn’t fit the way we generally use data.” -Ida Sim, MD, PhD\n\nThe
    unacceptable state of interoperability is often viewed as the biggest blocker
    to innovation. Exchanging data really is the key to the next healthcare transformation.
    Yet the other side of the coin—the deluge of data that is exchanged but is actually
    relatively useless—can be just as much of a depressant on innovation.\n\n### 5.
    The EHR must be a partner to the rest of healthcare.\n\n> “The government has
    spent somewhere between twenty to thirty billion dollars on EMR deployment and
    there is a little bit of embarrassment and concern why these things aren’t interoperable.”
    -Dr. Mark Braunstein\n\nShared incentives have not always been present for EHR
    vendors. While they have been the core driver in the most important transformation
    so far—the digitization of health data—they have not behaved in a way that contributes
    to increased interoperability and true innovation. In their defense, it’s not
    necessarily their fault: the economic incentives have not been present, and Meaningful
    Use didn’t enforce it. But that does not excuse the growing sentiment that EHR
    vendors must embrace being at the forefront of the next wave of transformation.\n\n###
    6. Healthcare’s situations are unique.\n\n> “The challenges that we face are always
    the ones that have confronted us in my three plus decades for caring for patients—policy.”
    -Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD\n\nThis is not a ground-breaking thought: healthcare is
    unique from every other industry in the economy because of its combination of
    regulatory, economic, political, security, privacy, and complexity pressures—not
    to mention we are dealing with people’s lives, not tweets. But, it is important
    to be reminded that these situations exist, and healthcare innovation is predicated
    on managing the uniqueness up front.\n\nWe invite you to read the complete report
    for many more great insights on innovation."
