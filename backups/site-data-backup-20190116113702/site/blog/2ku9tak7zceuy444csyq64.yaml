:summary: In the past, clinical trials could only extend as far as researchers could
  geographically recruit, but Apple's ResearchKit enables more valuable data sets.
:blog_lead: "Back in March, Apple released their iOS open-source clinical research
  platform, ResearchKit, that focused on health conditions, such as breast cancer
  and diabetes, leading to over 100,000 participants contributing their health data.
  Now, not even a year later, the mogul tech giant has released three new trials geared
  towards epilepsy, melanoma, and autism. Until recently, clinical trials could only
  extend as far as researchers could demographically and geographically recruit, but
  by moving clinical trials to a mobile based platform, like the iPhone or Apple Watch,
  researchers can now get exponentially more valuable data sets that can potentially
  accelerate medical research. \n\n> > Few will have the greatness to bend history
  itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the
  total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation. - Robert
  Kennedy\n"
:post: "\n### EpiWatch App & John Hopkins\n\nResearchers from John Hopkins University
  officially launched the EpiWatch app on October 15 to collect data from patients
  throughout each stage of a seizure. Utilizing the open source framework of Apple’s
  ResearchKit, the app is able to collect data pertaining to the recurrent characteristics
  common of seizures, such as unconventional responsiveness. With more than 3 million
  Americans and 65 million people worldwide currently living with epilepsy, researches
  will by using the collected data to create and implement new tools to monitor and
  manage the condition. Users will be able to activate the app when they are experiencing
  an oncoming seizure and the app will record heart rate and movements while also
  testing the user’s responsiveness by playing a purposeful memory game. This is the
  first medical research app to involve a cognitive analysis of this kind. The data
  collection is expected to take place throughout the next year or two and it is anticipated
  to provide momentous results. \n\n### Autism & Beyond & Duke University\n\nAlso
  released, a ResearchKit app titled [*Autism & Beyond*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autism-beyond/id1025327516?mt=8),
  developed by a team of researchers from Duke University and the Duke Medical Center,
  is aiming to learn more about autism in young children across all corners of the
  world. This well-intentioned mobile application will take users through questionnaires
  that will act as a screening tool and videos that will provide analysis of facial
  expressions in order to provide feedback towards potential developmental disorders
  in children. The app developers at Duke strongly relay that this app is not intended
  to serve as a diagnostic tool, but rather a method for families to receive feedback
  and encourage further consultation from a healthcare provider when seen appropriate.
  \n\n### Mole Mapper & OHSU\n\nLastly, another ResearchKit app, Mole Mapper, was
  constructed to learn about melanoma risks by having users contribute photos of their
  moles to track evolution over time. The app was designed by Dan Webster, a cancer
  biologist, and Oregon Health and Science University’s Sancy Leachman, M.d., Ph.D.,
  chair of the Department of Dermatology at the OHSU School of Medicine and director
  of the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute’s Melanoma Research Program. Webster and Leachman
  have enabled the app's users to own and maintain their images for personalized use
  \ but can also share with OHSU’s researchers by signing an electronic consent form
  in an effort to further studies on detection and prevention. More than 4,000 participants
  have contributed to this research and Mole Mapper is anticipated to expand to the
  tens of thousands in the near future.\n\n[Apple’s ResearchKit has created a lot
  of excitement](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/apple-s-researchkit-and-clinical-research-opportunities-and-challenges/)
  and energy that the industry has never seen before. Healthcare innovation is taking
  center stage and the world is reaping the benefits. Continue to check back regularly
  as we will be tracking the progress of these studies and others similar.\n\n"

  :summary: Where do the many predictions and technologies from Health 2.0, 2012 stand
    today? Which products were a hit? What predictions came to be true—or didn't?
  :blog_lead: "As we get our booth shipped and bags packed for Health 2.0 this year,
    I started thinking about when I first attended Health 2.0 five years ago. It was
    held at the Hilton in Union Square in San Francisco. I was in town for my startup's
    interview at Rock Health, which at the time was just a stroll down Geary and a
    left on Grant through the [Dragon Gate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Dragon_Gate_to_Chinatown.jpg)
    to the Rock Health offices in Chinatown. It was my first day ever in San Francisco;
    a place I would soon call home as I spent a chunk of 2012-2013 in the city for
    Rock Health. \n"
  :post: "I was a digital health neophyte at the time, which is to say I worked for
    companies that were much more Health 1.0 before that: Epic, Medseek, (stylized
    very Health 1.0ish as MEDSEEK) and Nordic. I was amazed to enter a room where
    digital health could be the future and where any innovation was possible. Crowdfunding,
    changes to incentives through the ACA, and the ubiquity of cell phones dominated
    conversations about the possibilities of wireless healthcare. Predictions abounded
    about who — told in Bay Area lingo — was going to be the Uber for healthcare.
    For someone who started his career in an era when doctors believed paper was the
    past, present, and future, it was invigorating to meet non-Epic employees who
    actually believed in a digital future for healthcare. \n\nTimes have changed.
    So has Health 2.0. Five years in startup time might as well feel like fifty. As
    a point of reference, you were likely a hipster making fun of Facebook's acquisition
    of Instagram in 2012 when I first attended the conference. While I was prepping
    for this year's Health 2.0 I stumbled across the [legacy website for Health 2.0
    in 2012](http://legacy.health2con.com/events/conferences/san-francisco-fall-2012/#venue).
    I wondered where the many topics, predictions, and technologies from 2012 stood
    today. Which ideas were a hit? What predictions came to be true and what technologies
    faded into the [\"Our Incredible Journey\"](https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/)
    tumblr. Here's an overview of the future as seen from 2012, now delivered in 2017.
    \n\n## Wearables and the Quantified Self\n\n**Then:** Wearables couldn't have
    been any bigger in 2012. Even though the Fitbit was, at the time, a [clip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fitbit_products#Fitbit_Zip),
    the possibilities of what could be done by tracking health information using now
    ubiquitous technologies like Bluetooth and Smartphones were endless. There were
    many sessions showing the potential of remote monitoring and smartphones, like
    \"Demos in Context: A Live Environment Exploring Personal Trackers\" (featuring
    now Propeller Health COO Chris Hogg) and \"Off the Couch and Into Shape: Tools
    for Physical Fitness\" (featuring Under Armour before buying MyFitnessPal and
    MapMyFitness).\n\n**Now:** The good news is that every modern iPhone has a pedometer
    in it and that Apple Watch sales are up 50% in 2017. The bad news is that everyone
    else didn't do so hot. Pebble is gone. Jawbone is gone. Fitbit is at 1/50th of
    its value from when it IPO'd in 2015. Did we get some good clinical research from
    the wearables? Actually, [yes](https://www.wired.com/story/bored-with-your-fitbit-these-cancer-researchers-arent/).
    Are we healthier as a whole? Hard to say. The good news is you're probably tracked
    everywhere now; the bad news is the wearables movement didn't necessarily materialize
    into one great set of outcomes or businesses. While startups that focused on deliver
    programs alongside wearables, like Omada Health and Propeller, have kept growing,
    other startups didn't necessarily make the leap. There's still hope for some of
    the 2012 darlings, as exemplified by Jawbone who fail-pivoted into building a
    \"Health Hub\" to compete in the more regulated health tech space.\n\n## Non-invasive
    Diagnosis and Diagnostics\n\n**Then:** There was a session on non-invasive diagnoses
    techniques, which had panelists from CellScope, Glooko (fresh off of a Series-A
    round of funding), Tawkon (tracking radiation exposure via cell phones), Transfuse
    Solutions, and First Derm. Ideas based on painful lab draws and general confusion
    around biometrics and results were beginning to gain traction at this time. \n\n**Now:**
    How did Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos not get an invite to this session? Not
    kidding. It feels like they should have been rubbing shoulders with the Bay Area
    darlings and \"innovators\" in the non-invasive blood draw space before Holmes
    began her Icarian rise into fame. Turns out there is an answer to the question,
    per the man himself. Health 2.0 founder Matthew Holt—Theranos [either ignored
    or eventually declined attendance at all events](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/10/16/five-takeaways-about-the-theranos-broo-ha-ha/).\n\n##
    Value-Based Care\n\n**Then:** While there were a few talks involving population
    health, the agenda for Health 2.0 mentions value-based care exactly zero times.
    There was one main stage session around ACOs and innovations in payment models.
    Conversation centered more around general cost reduction and consumer empowerment.
    Even the Twitter Health Team was getting in on the action, presenting how Twitter
    conceptualized its product being used to empower consumers in the post-ACA era.
    \n\n**Now:** Everyone's favorite digital health buzzword next to \"Big Data\"
    gets a variety of sessions and focus, though less so than [maybe last year](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/health-2.0-recap-day-3/)
    due to uncertainty driven by the government vis-a-vis the potential repeal of
    the ACA. \n\n## Blockchain\n\n**Then:** Bitcoin was hovering around $11.00-$12.00
    a bitcoin. \n\n**Now:** The blockchain is the solution to all of our problems
    in health tech, not withstanding:\n\n1. Difficulties in patient matching \n2.
    The patient stigma/business cases of sharing data \n3. Challenges in semantic
    interoperability \n4. Any clinician's willingness to take liability for receiving
    more data before treating a patient\n\n## Startups\n\n**Then:** *Launch!* was
    the premier event at which to launch a digital health startup. The startups, their
    fields, and whether or not they are still seemingly in business were:\n\n- **TicTrac:**
    Personalizable health and wellness platform.\n- **LifeVest Health *(now Life.io)*:**
    Insurance company technology platform.\n- **meQuilibrium:** Digital resilience
    coaching platform\n- **Unfrazzled:** Seemingly shut down. App for unpaid caregivers.\n-
    **First Stop Health:** Telemedicine for employers.\n- **EveryMove:** Wellness
    Platform\n- **Share the Visit:** Seemingly shut down. Telemedicine, but for family
    members and caregivers for other patient visits.\n- **ShareMD:** Pivoted to Datica
    :). [\"Pinterest for Doctors\"](http://legacy.health2con.com/tv/speaker/travis-good/)\n\n**Now:**
    \ There are now 12 startups pitching this year. Kind of amazing to see how many
    of the startups from *Launch!* 2012 survived and thrived given the vast changes
    in health tech and healthcare over the last five years. As for ShareMD, [Travis
    Good and Mohan Balachandran](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/leadership/) realized how hard
    it was to get their platform for residents into the hands of clinicians due to
    the arduous and varying requirements imposed on their cloud platforms by academic
    medical centers. Realizing they weren't the only vendors with this problem, Datica’s
    founders saw the real product wasn't the social network but, rather, the platform
    that would make it easier for vendors and organizations to prove and ascertain
    application compliance. And, as such, Datica (née Catalyze) was born. \n\nI hope
    you enjoyed this walk down memory lane. If you enjoyed this blog post, come see
    us at any or all the events we'll be participating in at Health 2.0: \n\n- Come
    learn about the lessons Datica has learned over the last five years and compare
    them to other experiences veterans are seeing in the field at our [Lunch and Learn
    panel at 12:30 on Monday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/194628).
    Christiana DelloRusso from Providence Ventures, Carolyn Jasik from Omada Health,
    and Kristi Ebong from Cedars-Sinai Accelerator will be joining Travis for a panel
    discussion about what success in digital health really looks like. \n- Our VP
    of Product Ryan Rich will be demoing on stage how easy it can be to deploy code
    in a compliant environment at [11:20 on Tuesday](https://fall2017.health2con.com/agenda/session/204332).
    \n- And, finally, we'll be at Booth #204 to talk about how we can help you be
    successful in digital health through compliance, security and healthcare data
    integration. Stop by and take our 3-minute assessment based on the [Digital Health
    Success Framework](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/dhsf/) to find out how far you’ve come in
    your own digital health journey and how far you still have to go.\n"

  :summary: Our newest publication Rethinking Healthcare Technology includes expansive,
    useful, and original essays on digital transformation from insightful leaders.
  :blog_lead: That's the most important question clinicians are asking themselves
    in a post-EHR world where patients have supercomputers in their pockets, and they
    expect the same high-quality, on-demand experiences the Apples, Googles, Amazons,
    and Facebooks give them.
  :post: "\nA world where doctors are spending more time looking at a screen than
    engaging with the patient.\n\nA world where wearables are creating a glut of data,
    some useful but most of it useless, and none of it fits into the EHR seamlessly.\n\nBut
    especially a world where innovators and entrepreneurs have never been more equipped
    with ideas, access to funding, and technology doubling in power every few years.
    These innovators are poised to help transform healthcare, but something in the
    industry, something in the system is slowing them down or holding them back.\n\nDatica
    explored the question of \"how does technology actually make an impact?\" in a
    series of interviews with influential thinkers and doers. The result is a publication
    of essays called, [“Rethinking Healthcare Technology.”](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/leadership-gallery/)

  :summary: You may already know Healthkit integrates with the Epic Mychart app, but
    here's a look at how that Epic Healthkit integration most likely really works.
  :blog_lead: 'There''s been no shortage of pieces on how the Epic/Healthkit integration
    _might_ work or should _work_. Even the piece in which [Epic spokespersons talked
    about functionality](http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/17/ehr-giant-epic-explains-how-it-will-bring-apple-healthkit-data-to-doctors/)
    points to how "the EHR accesses HealthKit data from the MyChart app, not via a
    direct integration with the HealthKit platform." Ok, so it uses MyChart, Epic''s
    patient portal. But saying that MyChart is used for integration is like saying
    that soufflé is made because a pan interfaces with a stove. What you really need
    to know are the ingredients and how they mix together. We''ve got the scoop.

'
  :post: |
    The first thing worth noting about the Epic to [Healthkit](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-healthcare/) integration is that *it is not patient-initiated*. Any user using the MyChart application on an iPhone running iOS 8 cannot decide to send information to their clinicians. Epic won't store it; in fact MyChart won't even show you the activity in MyChart unless a clinician has ordered MyChart tracking for you. You've been looking for real, prescribed apps? Here's the first one.

    While this may disappoint patients looking for a new communication tool, this makes alot of sense for doctors and clinicians. Many clinicians are afraid the upcoming [Internet of Things for healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/connected-health-today-and-in-the-future/) era will be a lot of static in ratio to noise. How can apps and EHRs guarantee clinicians only retrieve pertinent patient information from devices with intervention opportunity?

    When a clinician orders the "Healthkit" prescription, it prompts the doctors to set usual specific limits for "abnormal" alerting of tracked values. This is the killer feature. For a non-diabetic, a blood glucose level of 130 mg/dl would be abnormal. But, that's not who providers are concerned about. For a diabetic, a provider might want to dictate what they believe "abnormal" is for a specific patient. Maybe it's a blood glucose over 160 mg/dl. Maybe it's a blood glucose of 200 mg/dl. Existing EHR decision support/order recommendation tools can be used to provide high-level guidelines for tracking, but letting clinicians dictate what _they_ should warned about on a patient-by-patient level makes this tool truly useful.

    The somewhat comical thing about this is that it requires the clinician to ascertain that the patient is using an iPhone running iOS 8 to use Healthkit. When [Travis](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/) and I were chatting about this yesterday, he mentioned that he was looking forward to teasing his doctor colleagues on talking with their patients about what phone they used.

    _"I'm sorry, there was nothing we could do for the patient. We tried our hardest, but they had an iPhone 4S. We can't get their data."_

    Once the order is signed by the clinician, it goes through some Epic programming magic. The next time the patient signs into MyChart on their iPhone, they'll see the "Track my Health" feature. From there, clicking it allows the patient to pick the tracker prescription the doctor ordered. Clicking on that moves the patient over to Apple's Healthkit where Apple verifies that the user is going to share the requested data with MyChart. Once that is done, anytime a entry from a glucometer or smart scale goes into Healthkit, it sends the data to MyChart which then sends the data to Epic. If the data is abnormal, it lets the responsible clinician know through the EHR inbasket. Since the patient already has MyChart, the clinician could send the patient a message securely back to the patient with feedback or an Action Plan through secure messaging.

    ## What does it all mean?

    My thoughts:

    - App prescribing is here, and this is how it works. Apple has the first integration, but it seems like Epic is going to own some part of this workflow. There's been a few startups whose plan has been to prescribe apps; there will still be room for security/auditing/certification but the app prescription path (at least for Epic) will run through the [EHR's order entry](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-203-the-hl7-orm-order-entry-message/). It'll be interesting to see the process in which hospitals can petition Epic to select new apps and platforms (like Validic) to receive patient data.
    - It would be hard for other EHR/Patient Portal combos to replicate something like this. Epic has a pretty tight coupling between the EHR and their patient portal that other vendors would need to accomplish via some [EHR integrations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/ehr-integrations/) or custom APIs.
    - Traditional integration is still alive. MyChart/Healthkit helps your app write data to MyChart, but doesn't provide any controls to request patient data from it. If you want to get data out of the EHR, you'll need to do integration. If you want to get patient data into the EHR without any of the afforementioned steps, you'll need a traditional flowsheet/notes interface. Need help with that?

  :summary: HealthKit is important for developers — both data collectors and digital
    health app developers.
  :blog_lead: 'Apple WWDC was today. The buildup, as always, has been massive. It''s
    always a surprise what will be unveiled, though some sources seem to get reliable
    info ahead of time. I wrote a [post](http://histalkmobile.com/what-could-healthbook-be/)
    last week on Healthbook. That post was largely speculative, as everything is before
    Apple formally announces it. In that post, I described Healthbook as the new app
    that is very likely going to be a part of the new version of iOS, iOS 8, from
    Apple.

'
  :post: |+
    At that time the speculation, which I delve into much deeper in the post mentioned above, is that Healthbook would be basically Passbook but for health- and wellness-related cards. There are some major differences I thought would exist between Healthbook and Passbook. I speculated that Apple would take structured health and wellness data for Healthbook cards, not just blobs of data and images like Passbook. This is a major difference from Passbook and opens up Apple as a potential aggregator and hub of health and wellness data.

    Additionally, Apple has sensors built into its hardware, and these sensors are getting better with each new hardware release. These sensors can can track activity data on people. If Apple ever releases an iWatch, which it didn't announce at WWDC today, that may add to the set of data Apple is able to collect itself without 3rd party apps and sensors.

    We now have a better sense of what Healthbook will be, and it won't be called Healthbook. It's called [HealthKit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/), and it's vying to be a hub of health and wellness data. With HealthKit, apps can share data with Apple, and Apple in turn says "the user decides which data should be shared with your app." Data can be collected via sensor or by manual patient input. [Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS8.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014205-SW1) is scant but one of the interesting things it does say is that "Once data is shared with your app, your app can register to be notified when that data changes; you have fine-grained control over when your app is notified." This is very cool and very powerful; more on this below. Some of the first apps that come to mind for integration with HealthKit are Nike apps, Fitbit, Withings, Jawbone, MyFitnessPal, LoseIt!, and Wahoo, among others.

    The sample code Apple [provides](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/Fit/Introduction/Intro.html) today is for a nutrition app that tracks the name of a food and the energy associated with that food, in joules. This is such a random and specific example that I'm wondering why they used it. For this example, the name of the food is a string and joules is a double. That's all right now for documentation. It's still largely speculative how Apple will model out health data, and if Apple will add in the ability to codify data, which in health and wellness could make it much more valuable.

    The biggest surprises in the announcement were partnerships with Mayo Clinic and Epic. Mayo is building an app that will integrate blood pressure readings into HealthKit, and enable sharing of that data with Mayo providers. I'm curious if there's a communication aspect of this in which Mayo providers can reach out to patients based on readings entered into HealthKit. Mayo was also quoted at WWDC, a nice piece of social proof from an established brand in healthcare.

    With the Epic partnership, it's an open question what the integration will look like. Will Epic be sharing its data with Apple, or vice versa, or both? Apple played up the brand of Epic in healthcare, showcasing a slide full of logos from Epic institutions. If this is simply a way to get HealthKit data into Epic MyChart, it holds little value. The experience of viewing the data in HealthKit is going to be much better than MyChart, and having the ability to view HealthKit data alongside Epic data in MyChart is of limited value. I'm skeptical of an Apple-Epic integration any deeper than that, at least in the short to medium term.

    ## What does this mean for app developers?

    HealthKit is important for developers, both data collectors (sensor makers and apps that collect data directly) as well as those interested in building apps that harness health and wellness data. Assuming Apple has success in getting developers to implement apps and data into HealthKit, the following are interesting things for developers to consider.

    * Data is important. It's the reason Apple is trying to aggregate data from apps that run on iOS. With HealthKit, Apple is opening up a potential treasure drove of data to any app developer that can get a user to share HealthKit data with their app. This makes it easy for any mobile developer with a good design sense to build an app that harnesses data collected from a myriad of apps and devices (assuming all those apps and devices integrate with HealthKit). And if Apple integrates tracking data from its own hardware sensors, which I imagine it has to do, that's tracking data on almost every iPhone user. That's powerful for developers.

    *  Data, no matter how well designed, is only going to go so far to engage individuals in their health and help drive positive behavior change. With HealthKit, apps will be able to set "fine-grained" notification rules for changes to HealthKit data. I can imagine an almost limitless number of use cases for this - messages to users to close the feedback loop, to family or friends (social pressure), to physicians or health systems to trigger interventions, to pharmacies for refills, and on and on. This opens up a ton of possibilities to go beyond data and drive real positive change in health and wellness behavior.

    * Building anything for Apple means building on a platform that has access to 100s of millions of verified accounts with credit cards for payment processing. While I don't think these accounts represents all, or maybe even most, of the people in real need of help with health and wellness, it does simplify your business model if you have users that are willing and able to pay. Of course, if you use Apple for payments, you'll be giving them 30%.

    * Sensor and hardware makers can focus on hardware and rely on Apple for software. I'm not sure how practical this one is, but HealthKit opens to door to extremely inexpensive sensors to integrate data into HealthKit and instantly be a part of a larger ecosystem that can write software to leverage that data.

    The major things I wonder about with HealthKit relate to privacy, security, and ownership of data. With Apple potentially sharing data with healthcare providers, will it be signing BAAs and at what point does HIPAA apply? Who owns the data if a user decides to move off of iOS? Apple does not have the best track record of [supporting](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-keep-receiving-sms-from-iphone-users-after-making-the-switch-to-android/) open, cross platform standards. These are all yet-to-be-answered questions.

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database

    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
