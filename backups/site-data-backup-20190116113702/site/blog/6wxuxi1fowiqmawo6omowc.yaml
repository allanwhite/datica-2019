:post: "Back in 2012, the HIPAA Compliance Audit program did a year of trial audits
  and now that the US Department of Health and Human Services has had sufficient time
  to analyze the results, the 2015 HIPAA Audit Program has been revealed. Most likely
  the key objectives for this round of audit questioning will be to focus on the inadequacies
  spotted in the 2012 trials. Requisitions for information have been consigned to
  near 1200 covered entities and business associates by the HHS to ascertain if it
  would be apropos to audit. Since new HIPAA rules enact higher fines - mandatory
  minimum fines of $10, 000 - for willful neglect of compliance, being sagacious and
  preconditioned for an unprecedented audit is more important than ever. Federal and
  private officials have openly and candidly stated that enforcement is a top priority
  of the HHS. So a message to non-compliant covered entities and business associates:
  Beware that there will be little to no leniency for non-compliance now and for many
  years to come. \r\n\r\n### Key Takeaways from 2012 Audits\r\n\r\n- Covered entities
  on the smaller side bore many more issues. The smaller entities represented 66%
  of paucity findings. \r\n- An inordinate amount of these inadequacies were by healthcare
  providers. These providers accounted for 50% of the audited entities and recounted
  for 81% of these insufficiency findings. \r\n- 65% of overall findings were in relation
  to the Security Rule, but the OCR did ascribe this to the audit protocol having
  primary focus on security rather than breach notification or privacy.\r\n\r\n###
