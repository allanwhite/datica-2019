:summary: Industry focus on patient outcomes has never been higher yet some healthcare
  innovators are focused on technology first and outcomes second. Wonder why?
:blog_lead: 'Industry focus on patient outcomes has never been higher. Key healthcare
  stakeholders, from payers, providers, vendors and others, all indicate that this
  focus will surely escalate. The emphasis may appear new, but as early as 1998, the
  [_Journal of of General Internal Medicine_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1496942/)
  began covering the patient outcomes movement. Considering this surge in interest,
  you may be wondering why some healthcare innovators are focusing on technology first
  and outcomes second.

'
:post: "In a rush to get a healthcare technology to market and a paying client on
  the books, vendors often sidestep this important piece to the solution. As a result,
  many health systems across the country are being sold new technologies that don't
  address patient outcomes first. Clinicians wonder why. In a recent [_Healthcare
  Innovators Podcast_][2], Ida Sim, MD, who is a primary care physician, informatics
  researcher, entrepreneur and Professor of Medicine at the University of California,
  San Francisco, shared her thoughts on technology implementation as it relates to
  patient outcomes. \"The place to start is not to have a great app or sensor, [nor]
  how to get as many people to use it for as long as possible,\" says Sim. Instead,
  she explains, \"Outcomes are generated jointly by the healthcare system and the
  patients themselves, so that's the place to start.\" This approach transcends wearables
  and applications; it can also be applied to larger technologies, such as electronic
  medical records (EMRs). \n\nIn some ways, starting with the technology is counterintuitive.
  Few organizations effectively manage patients outside of traditional episodes. Datica
  CEO and Chief Privacy Officer, [Travis Good, MD](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/about/travis/)
  gave his perspective on the subject recently. \"The healthcare providers, focused
  most on patient outcomes, like Denver Health, have had the management of patients
  in their DNA long before applying any technology to achieve efficiencies.\" \n\n##
  Effective Technology is Outcome-Based\n\nFor healthcare innovators, starting with
  patient outcomes first promises to provide technical solutions that dramatically
  impact patients and the industry as a whole. Some development organizations are
  already taking this approach and that's exciting to watch.\n\nWorking at Datica
  gives us an in-the-trenches view of impactful industry technologies that address
  patient outcomes first. Madison-based [healthfinch][3], for example, needed EMR
  integrations for implementing its automated prescription refill solutions within
  a hospital system. Healthfinch started with the specific population need, then crafted
  a technology solution with patient outcomes at the heart of that solution. This
  story, and others from health vendors working on patient outcome-first technologies,
  can be found in the [Datica customer][4] stories. \n\nAre you developing technologies
  focused first on patient outcomes? Datica can help you scrutinize that process,
  which will ultimately provide the most value for clinicians and the hospitals for
  whom they work. That technology approach leads to long-term success and product
  viability for customers.\n\n\n[2]: /innovation/ida-sim-md/\n[3]: http://healthfinch.com\n[4]:

  :post: |
    Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll present four high-level trends that follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all sectors of the industry, and opportunities for new solutions to help address uncertainty and new problems. Here's the 2017 healthcare trend #1.

    ## Walgreens, payors, life sciences, subscription medicine and the rise of the patient as consumer

    > "Businesses are no longer the sole creator of a brand; it is co-created by consumers through shared experiences and defined by the results of online searches and conversations." - Brian Solis

    One of the major shifts that has come to healthcare is the patient is at the center of the ecosystem. This has come about for a few reasons, namely due to societal and cultural shifts driving changing expectations but also because patients are feeling the burden of the costs of care more and more. [Shifts in technology](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcares-shifting-definition-of-the-cloud/) are underlying some of these shifts as well and certainly are enabling models of care where patients have more ownership.

    The reasons for the change are less important than the impact of the change on the industry and patients/consumers. Healthcare, a multi-trillion dollar industry, is experiencing a paradigm shift and the main user, the end user, is now the patient/consumer. This means the consumer is the new target and the [choke point][3] to massive aspects of the most massive industry in the world. Look no further than the myriad of initiatives from all the major sectors trying to "win" the consumer.

    * **Life sciences companies** are transforming themselves from makers of therapeutics to care management platforms that are complemented by therapeutics. This is an incredible change but one that is being taken because, like direct-to-consumer products, life sciences companies need to have a direct relationship with the end-user to effectively market and retain them as lifetime customers with very targeted marketing and promotion. Life sciences companies are well resourced and motivated to make this change, and will be spending more than any other segment to win the end user and deliver care management platforms.
    * **Retail pharmacies**, most specifically Walgreens and CVS, have been [expanding][4] their care delivery services, becoming more than simple drug dispensaries. Retail pharmacies now offer both chronic and acute care, preventative medicine (vaccines most specifically), and even telemedicine. Pharmacies are well placed, having 10s of 1000s of physical locations across the country, to be a larger and larger part of the way consumer access the healthcare system. Walgreens is even rolling out Epic as its EHR; despite being a strange choice for a retail clinic, Epic helps Walgreens integrate data to and from other Epic customers.
    * **Payors**, the largest ones in particular – United, Cambia, Blues, etc. – are expanding the tools they offer members to be more than simple data access and payment tools. Large insurance companies are building and testing apps for specific conditions and cohorts of members, wanting to flip the perception of payors in consumers' minds to more than payment tools managed by their employers. [Oscar][5] is a good example of a payor that doesn't act like a traditional payor.
    * **Subscription medicine** is here to stay, whether you call it [direct primary care (DPC)][6] or concierge. Concierge and DPC, interestingly, are the providers' response to this trend. Subscription medicine is about a direct relationship between providers and patients, without messy payors and administrative overhead between them. And subscription medicine is going to grow by leaps and bounds over the next 10 years. Consumers will seek to get back the personal side of medicine, something that is increasingly getting lost, and providers will seek the same direct, personal connections without the mess of working with payors. In terms of models of care, subscription medicine is the [best example of aligned incentives][7].

    There are a few things to note about the examples above. First, noticeably absent from the list are hospitals and health systems. It's not that health systems don't see these changes and growing threats, it's that [they are just too slow][8], and too poorly setup, to change. And, with the growth of consumer-based initiatives by all of the above, the erosion of the relationship between provider and patient is only accelerating the displacement of providers and the validity of the argument against MDs as PCPs and providers; it's a vicious cycle and providers are the major losers.

    The second thing to note is that this is a winner take all situation. Consumers, the group notorious for downloading then never using health apps, will not use multiple care management platforms from their drug company, insurance company, and local pharmacy. They prefer to use one platform for everything,  just as they now use the one app from their bank or an aggregator like Mint instead of using multiple apps from each specific financial institution they interact with. There's a lot of money for the winner. This is high stakes.

    So where does that leave health systems? From the list above, almost everything is focused on chronic care. Health systems, and MDs as providers, will continue to own high acuity care and the exceptional specialization that is now required for that care. The real risk is that whichever segment wins the consumer will control, either through human providers or AI-assisted clinical decision support, when patients are sent to providers and which providers they are sent to for high acuity care.

    This shift offers huge opportunities for care management technologies with the right partners. Some sectors and companies will build everything in-house while others will look to buy products and platforms. The companies that succeed will offer ready-to-implement systems with a mix of technology and services. In order for any of the above groups to succeed, the focus on consumers and end users has to be a super strategic initiative, not just about buying an app or platform but a complete suite of solutions and aligning the business at the highest level to accomplish the goals.

  :blog_lead: "Recently we published our first five Customer Spotlights, a new section
    on the website sharing the amazing and diverse stories our customers have to tell.
    \n\nWe noticed something interesting when working with our customers: Their origin
    stories, visions on how to change healthcare, and traction were all so compelling,
    and surprisingly diverse. It reminded us of the vastness of healthcare; the industry
    is full of things to be fixed, and there is no shortage of innovators ready to
    step up."
  :post: |-
    It got to the point where we knew these stories had to be shared. We would have feel-good moments each time we heard how a customer was truly making a dent in the universe, and wanted to pass those moments onto you.

    So what are these spotlights?

    Unlike traditional "case studies" focusing on jointly achieved outcomes, each spotlight strictly highlights the story of our customer; they have nothing to do with Datica. Instead, we catalog their founding origin stories, broadcast their vision of the future of healthcare, and share in their successes to date. Their efforts to better healthcare deserve their own platform.

    Today five spotlights are available, but more are on the way. The positive response by customers has been fantastic—everyone we've asked has said YES! to being profiled.

    * [Purple Binder][1]: Technology that bridges healthcare systems and social services to impact patient outcomes
    * [CareMessage][2]: Using technology to connect lower-income patients with caring providers
    * [Community Services for the Deaf][3]: Innovative Technologies Protect Personal Health Information and Expand Employment Opportunity
    * [DispatchHealth][4]: A company at the epicenter of the shift to value-based care as it redefines healthcare delivery
    * [Healthfinch][5]: Using technology to automate, delegate and simplify repeatable clinical tasks

    Take a look at our first five spotlights, and keep an eye on many more in the works.

    If you are an existing customer and want to share your story, send us an email at [hello@datica.com][6] to get the conversation started.

  :summary: The Midwest is predicted to have more startups than Silicon Valley in
    five years. It's time for Madison, Wisconsin to be on the startup community's
    radar.
  :blog_lead: 'In a city underrated by those who have never visited, Madison, WI,
    brings more to the Midwest than its prestigious university and famous State Street.
    The Midwest is [predicted to have more startups than Silicon Valley in five years](http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/28/in-5-years-the-midwest-will-have-more-startups-than-silicon-valley/).
    VentureBeat author Chris Olson states, "Today entrepreneurs are building more
    billion-dollar companies in the Midwest than in the last 50 years combined." It''s
    time for Madison to be on the radar among the national startup community.

'
  :post: "The entrepreneurial activity in Madison can be attributed to the top talent
    from the University of Wisconsin and large local companies (AmFam, Epic Systems,
    etc). The startup community here varies from micro-breweries to medical devices.
    Whether it's a first-time entrepreneur opening her new soap business or a serial
    entrepreneur focusing on patient engagement, resources bring the entrepreneurial
    community together.\n\nThree examples are [100 State][2], [1 Million Cups][3]
    and the [Weinert Center for Entrepreneurship][4]. Although each resource differs
    in purpose, they share two commonalities: 1) bringing entrepreneurs together and
    2) leveraging network diversity for growth. Even meetups are growing to help unite
    entrepreneurs in the area. As Brian Lee from Madisonstartups.com put it, \"Madison
    has a full ecosystem of resources and organizations all working toward a common
    goal.\"   \n\nOne example of the community coming together is 1 Million Cups,
    a weekly meetup for startups to present their ideas and receive audience feedback.
    I remember my first time at 1 Million Cups as I watched Datica's Chief Strategy
    Officer present to the audience. The audience consisted of employees from Nordic
    Consulting Group, consulting,  financial firms and startups. This diverse group
    provided great feedback for Datica, while audience engagement buzzed with energy
    and inspired us to further work within the Madison startup community.\n\nLikewise,
    the Madison business community also comes together to support each other, to which
    health technology shines brightly. Datica is thrilled to be a central example:
    We work closely with customers like Propeller Health, Healthfinch, Health eFillings,
    Wellbe, [m]Pirik, Ensodata, True Health Connection, and CE Learning Systems. We
    maintain several integrations with regional health systems, such as Aurora Healthcare,
    Froedtert & The Medical College of WI, and Children's Hospital of WI — all of
    which are taking innovative approaches toward addressing healthcare needs.\n\nAlong
    with industry giants Epic and Nordic, the Madison health technology community
    is working together to solve important problems. As Aristotle once said, \"The
    whole is greater than the sum of its parts,\" and Datica is happy to be a part
    of it. \n\n\n[2]: https://100state.com/\n[3]: http://www.1millioncups.com/madison\n[4]:
