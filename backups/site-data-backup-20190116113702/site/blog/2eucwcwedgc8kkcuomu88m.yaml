  A sample size of 301 survey respondents yielded a few insightful statistical points. First, researchers found out that 84% of respondents had a usable endpoint device, meaning a phone, tablet, or computer with a working microphone and camera. Most were on broadband. Those with technology concerns should be relieved — adoption issues will not stem from technical inability.

  The willingness of patients to engage with a [telemedicine program](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/) was high. Well over half would participate if given the option. A full 38% said they were "very likely" to engage. The age breakdown skewed towards and older demographic with the average being 57.9 years old. Thus, even though most patients had access to appropriate technology, it was not a surprise that they had little experience conducting telepresence calls, e.g. Skype. These two points in conjunction are important: the gap between high willingness and lower experience shows that patients view the potential for telemedicine very favorably.

  The results of the study clearly showed that telemedicine is on the verge of widespread market adoption. Like most markets, supply and demand must both be present to be viable, and healthcare presents additional challenges because of reimbursement challenges with telemedicine services. This one study is yet another data points towards evidence that demand exists. It is now up to healthcare providers to innovate and drive change.

  Thankfully, many smart companies are working hard on the supply side. Two Datica customers, [Zipnosis](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/customer/zipnosis/) and [Telepharm](https://www.telepharm.com/), are true innovators. As we start to see healthcare administrators focus more on innovation, telemedicine is poised to be a growing industry.

  :summary: 'Innovators in healthcare face a common dilemma: New technologies and
    tech-enabled services need to provide an ROI in two drastically different health
    systems.'
  :blog_lead: 'Clayton Christensen coined the phrase "innovators dilemma" in his aptly
    named [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) with the
    same title. He went on to co-author a book specifically addressing opportunities
    for innovation and disruption in healthcare. Both of those books are worth reading.
    Though not specifically a subject of either book, we''ve uncovered, time and time
    again, that innovators in healthcare face a common dilemma. The dilemma, highlighted
    in our Innovation Series [interview with Dr. Mark Chasin](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/marc-chasin-md/)
    and our interview with iTriage co-founder [Dr. Wayne Guerra](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/wayne-guerra-md-mba/),
    is that new technologies and tech-enabled services in healthcare need to provide
    an ROI in two drastically different health systems - 1) our current, still dominant,
    volume-based system (fee for service) and 2) our fast growing, but still minority,
    value-based system (accountable care).

'
  :post: "I remember hearing members of the HCA executive team discussing this same
    topic a few years ago at a conference. HCA is a massive, for-profit health system,
    and has money to invest in new technology (it has a venture fund and also recently
    [acquired PatientKeeper](http://www.patientkeeper.com/news_events/press_release.html?id=22834)),
    but it also realizes what keeps the lights on today - volume of care, or more
    care, not less. On the panel executives at HCA talked about how they fully realized
    the direction healthcare incentives are going but also know where those incentives
    are today. They talked about investing and planning for a different health system
    future so the organization would be prepared to basically flip a switch when the
    scales tip in favor of value over volume. Not all organizations have the resources
    to prepare this way.\r\n\r\nHealthcare, despite being a massive industry, does
    not have high margins. At least most provider organizations don't have high margins.
    Putting current provider revenue at risk by making the system more efficient (less
    duplicate testing, reduced readmissions and ED visits, etc), while probably the
    *right* thing to do, could close the already small gaps hospitals have between
    revenue and costs. Thus, healthcare innovators, both inside and outside the enterprise,
    need to find ways to help keep the lights on today while preparing systems for
    tomorrow as they go about building new technologies and tech-enabled services.\r\n\r\nWhile
    not always easily done, there are a few examples we've seen of successfully adding
    value today while fitting very well with the incentives of tomorrow. In some cases,
    it's simply a matter of choosing the right target areas (conditions, episodes,
    etc) and messaging.\r\n\r\n* *Bundled payments.* Bundled payments [align value
    and quality with reimbursement](http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/bundled-payments/).
    For select procedures, health systems can elect to receive a certain amount, a
    bundle, of payment for each patient. The health systems succeed when the care
    they provide limits follow-up and complications, ultimately lowering their cost
    and improving the quality of care. Services that enable this, such as [Healthloop](http://healthloop.com/),
    are well placed to expand beyond bundled payments when health systems begin to
    feel the broader pressure of more risk in payer contracts. \r\n\r\n* *Readmission
    prevention.* This is similar to bundled payments. Technology and services that
    [reduce the number of readmissions](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html),
    for certain conditions, protect health systems from penalties. The goal is preventing
    readmission within the first 30 days of discharge. Beyond 30 days, there's good
    data that a large percentage of patients are readmitted within 60 days, 90 days,
    180 days, and within 1 year of readmission. In an accountable care world, services
    with a foothold preventing readmissions can expand to prevent extended readmissions,
    or maybe just admissions, that would cost the system.\r\n\r\n* *Concierge medicine
    / direct primary care (DPC).* There are a few aspects of subscription-based medicine
    (concierge or DPC) that align with trends coming to healthcare. The first is that
    subscription medicine has incentives to keep patients happy so they don't churn,
    or leave the practices. Unlike most of healthcare today, customer service matters
    here. The second reason is that subscription medicine is largely provided by primary
    care providers. These providers work hard to prevent catastrophic, or really any
    form, or expensive care because many patients that use subscription medicine have
    high deductible insurance plans.\r\n\r\n* *Analytics.* This is a broad bucket
    with many meanings. In the future, analytics will ideally help to reduce the cost
    of care while improving the quality of care. Today, analytics can be used to suggest
    and maximize covered (reimbursed) care, increasing revenue for health systems.
    In doing so, theses services overcome hurdles of access to data and can easily
    flip from promoting more care to reducing the amount of care, or appropriating
    care to the right populations.\r\n\r\n* *Telemedicine.* Telemedicine represents
    a major shift in the way care is delivered. Today it can be used to generate new
    revenue from patients willing to pay out of pocket for convenience or to make
    systems more competitive for certain desirable populations. In the future it can
    be used to reduce the cost of care for accountable care patients and maybe even
    prevent more expensive forms of care.\r\n\r\n* *Patient portals.* Patient portals
    address a core requirement of Meaningful Use (MU) by providing patients with access
    to their medical records. Today this helps health systems get incentives from
    the government. In the future, these portals can be used to expand services to
    patients and *maybe* become the hubs for patients accessing digital health services.
    That's a big *maybe*.\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly more examples. We'd love to
    hear from you about the ones we missed, or from those with experience selling
    ROI today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\n"

  :summary: Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
    key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
    epic transformations.
  :blog_lead: 'Taking an inside look at the United States healthcare systems can reveal
    key insights for chief information officers (CIOs) as the industry goes through
    epic transformations. Today’s healthcare CIO can come from a myriad of backgrounds
    since IT is no longer a prerequisite for the position. Rather than a technical
    nature, a business-oriented mindset is crucial in order for healthcare CIOs to
    be strategic and manage the system’s financial metrics. With the healthcare industry
    shifting gears and the CIOs no longer narrowly focusing on the technology, what

  :post: "## Population Health Management\n\nForward-thinking healthcare leaders have
    been actively pursuing population health management objectives. These objectives
    pertain to some of the most challenging cohorts that the twenty-first-century
    CIO has fully embraced. Proven solutions show that data analytics play a vital
    role in providing insight into individuals and populations, assuring that standardized,
    actionable, and substantial healthcare delivery information is received. The CIO
    of healthcare systems has the power to leverage influence to shift the quality
    of human health across entire segments of the population. The key challenges faced
    involve data: patient ascertainment, stratification, and analytics for exertions
    or interventions. \n\n## Strategic Interoperability\n\nA lot of buzz around interoperability
    has been happening since 2013 and for justifiable cause. Interoperability addresses
    some of healthcare’s most pressing plights so the demand for achieving interoperability
    is only on the rise. Despite this severe imposition, most healthcare organizations
    have only begun their journey to achieving interoperability. \n\nIntegration engines
    are what most healthcare organizations currently use to enable simplistic messaging
    between systems. This fits the homogenous nature of the [HL7v2](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/)
    standard. Having your integration capabilities entirely behind the hospital's
    firewall is no longer enough as interoperability requires a more strategic stance.
    These organizations need an interoperability solution that can facilitate strategic
    growth plans through acquisitions and mergers. Interoperability not only has become
    an industry-level issue but is also a prerequisite for success in other healthcare
    initiatives such as coordinated care, patient engagement, and [enterprise innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/).
    \n\n## Big Data Analytics\n\nIn the CIO’s domain, an ever-growing scope of data
    is overseen, distributed among multiple divergent systems, both in structured
    and unstructured configurations. Never seen before, content from social media
    and text messages can be found in a patient’s health record, contributing to the
    volume, momentum, and diversity of data. With all of the latest technologies in
    mobile devices, physician dashboards, telehealth, etc., CIOs are faced with one
    of the greatest HIT challenges of aggregating, normalizing, and integrating all
    of that Big Data down to the actionable direction at the time of care. CIOs are
    being looked upon to make this data interoperable, support engagement, and coerce
    the proper exploits by understanding the data from a technical and cultural framework.

  :summary: Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population
    at a significantly reduced cost is the basis for innovation of most healthcare
    systems.
  :blog_lead: "Achieving a higher quality of patient care for more of the population
    at a significantly reduced cost is the ultimate dream of most healthcare systems.
    [Innovation](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) is the key to being able to provide
    that healthcare excellence but there are socioeconomic needs that need to be addressed
    first. The healthcare innovation model has been largely driven by copious amounts
    of research and development to construct new technologies and processes, which
    can prove to be very costly. Healthcare spending is already skyrocketing as more
    Americans are getting sicker, so just as there is a desire for disruptive technologies,
    a disruptive approach to innovation is warranted. Frugal innovation will be the
    approach that delivers more social and economic benefits while utilizing fewer
    resources and promoting affordability, sustainability, accessibility, and quality.
    \n"
  :post: "\nFrugal innovation, falling in sync with the industry’s transition from
    volume to value care, will mandate a preference towards simplicity over sophistication.
    Healthcare solutions that are easier to use are more accessible, demand little
    maintenance, and are less expensive. Sometimes the simplest ideas truly are the
    best. It pays to also consider what is already applicable in a patient’s present
    environment, so review what technologies and processes could potentially be repurposed
    to solve another existing need. This will allow you to compensate for what is
    scarce with what is abundant. Providers should be exercising their already existing
    resources, like mobile and satellite connectivity, to deliver care better, faster,
    and cheaper. \n\nPublic and private sectors of healthcare need to collaborate
    together to increase their community impact. Amalgamating knowledge and networks
    will allow for further reach into any endeavor. Healthcare pockets of excellence
    will stay just that, assisting a small portion of populations instead of providing
    support to those who could truly benefit from the advancements. Adopting a collaboration
    [solution platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/compliant-cloud/) that will allow for higher
    engagement from professionals and patients alike to fix what needs fixing. Ultimately,
    co-operating between sectors will allow for frugal innovation to take place resulting
    in co-creation of sustainable and affordable health solutions that benefit a larger
    populace. \n"
