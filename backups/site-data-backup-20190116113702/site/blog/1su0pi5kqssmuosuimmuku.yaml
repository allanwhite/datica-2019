:summary: Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care,
  or concierge medicine, cutting out the payors is 1 of 6 2018 trends Datica predicts.
:blog_lead: Where is healthcare going in 2018? In the first article in this series,
  I outlined [six trends for 2018](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
  I predict we’ll see as the government, individuals, and private sector demand change
  this year. The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay practices. Whether
  you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine,
  the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.
:post: "What do you do when you get so frustrated with inefficiency and intermediaries
  in a transaction? If you’re like most consumers today, you’ll find a way to go directly
  to the supplier — meaning anybody producing a product or service that is of value
  to customers. There are huge technology leaps being made that have eliminated logistical
  challenges and enabled suppliers to have new or improved direct access to customers;
  as you can see below, it’s also created many opportunities for new, very large businesses.
  \n\nHere’s a short list of direct-to-supplier examples:\n\n* Alibaba allows you
  to order directly from factories in China. It eliminates retailers. This is typically
  used for commercial merchandise and equipment. Try it. It’s incredible what you
  can customize for an order of 1 and have directly shipped to you.\n* Etsy connects
  small, niche makers to sell directly to customers. It eliminates retailers and opens
  up huge geographies for makers. Etsy has gotten a lot of bad press lately but that
  doesn’t change the underlying premise.\n* Patreon enables creators to be sponsored
  by fans, or patrons, through subscriptions. It provides artists more freedom to
  pursue their craft with direct support from fans.\n* Stratechery is a subscription
  technology analysis publication. It eliminates publishers. It’s one person, Ben
  Thompson, that has built a personal brand outside of traditional publishing channels.
  There are many such publications but Stratechery is a personal favorite.\n* The
  Athletic is a subscription local sports publication. It eliminates traditional paper
  press. It enables local sports writers to provide deeper insight into players and
  teams through long-form publishing that doesn’t fit well with where traditional
  newspapers have evolved.\n* Netflix sells on-demand video content directly to consumers.
  It reduces the demand for cable bundles and, in the process, traditional advertisers.
  Now, with public market funding, Netflix is building the largest content catalog
  in the world and selling access to it directly to consumers.\n\n## Healthcare transactions
  are frustrating for consumers and providers\n\nIf you were to poll people on the
  most frustrating experiences they’ve had with transactions, I’d wager that healthcare
  ranks number one. The commercial payor process in healthcare is broken to the core,
  mostly by design, to create friction that intentionally minimizes payment to providers
  and reduces the liability of payors. The process sucks for both sides.\n\nConsumers
  typically have insurance through employers, reducing or eliminating choice. Payors
  then have networks of approved providers, thereby dictating which providers those
  consumers are allowed to see, again reducing choice. Then, when consumers go to
  their provider to get care it’s nearly impossible to have an accurate idea of their
  responsibility before a service is provided; they only find out much later how much
  the service cost, how much the payors haggled the price down, what the payor covered,
  and what amount is left for the individual to pay.\n\nBelieve it or not, the provider
  side is worse. Payors are heavy handed — to put it mildly — with providers in negotiating
  payment rates. For example, commercial payors pay providers vastly different rates
  based on the supply and demand for different specialties in different geographic
  areas. Payors also drag their feet and take anywhere from 60 days to 6 months after
  applications are submitted to approve new fully-licensed physicians and add them
  to their networks. Then, providers submit claims and those claims are either rejected
  (based on real or not even real mistakes in claim submission and documentation)
  or paid within some period of time (usually 30 to 90 days). Providers can then dispute
  rejected claims. This is a lot of work and providers spend lots of money to increase
  collections and speed the time to collections; simplistically this is “revenue cycle
  management” and is a multibillion-dollar industry in its own right in healthcare.\n\nWhen
  something goes wrong, consumers often blame providers; read provider reviews online
  and you’ll see many of them are complaints about payment. It’s a lot easier to blame
  the provider, with a face in front of you, vs the payor with it’s oftentimes outsourced
  call center service options.\n\n## The commercial insurance model of care insulates
  both providers and patients\n\nOne of the major hurdles in applying free market
  principles to healthcare in the United States is that, as I laid out above, the
  parties involved in the healthcare services transaction — the provider and the patient
  — are insulated from the financial transaction. I’m talking about the commercial
  insurance model of care that dominates our health system today. In this model, while
  there is typically some financial exchange with patients paying a deductible and,
  at times, some amount of patient responsibility at or before care is provided, oftentimes
  the bulk of payment for healthcare services is done separately, insulating providers
  and patients. This insulation is true even of providers in small private practices
  and is especially true for employed physicians who typically track what are called
  relative value units (RVUs), not collections, that determine their salaries; RVUs
  are a topic unto themselves and beyond the scope of this post.\n\n## Are cash-pay
  medical practices the solution?\n\nWhat’s the reaction to this? Cut out the payors.
  This is what cash-pay medical practices are all about. Whether you call it cash
  pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine, the underlying
  commonality is cutting out the payors. This is providers and consumer reacting to
  the frustration and overhead of working with payors. The desirable outcomes are
  similar for both providers and patients — longer appointments, more timely access
  to providers (off hours is usually included), and real accountability.\n\nCash-pay
  medicine has seen a tremendous growth in popularity and will continue to grow as
  the traditional commercial insurance model of healthcare continues to get worse.
  [Survey data consistently shows](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/01/30/1-in-10-doctor-practices-flee-medicare-to-concierge-medicine/#4819d6514568)
  that a high number of providers are interested in switching to concierge medicine.
  Sadly, the poster children for building networks and scaling cash-pay medicine have
  not fared well —  [QLiance](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/qliance-closes-after-10-year-effort-at-new-approach-to-basic-medical-care/)
  and [Turntable Health](https://lasvegasweekly.com/intersection/2017/jan/11/turntable-healths-closure-leaves-downtown-patients/)
  have struggled and had to shut down. [One Medical](https://www.onemedical.com) has
  grown more slowly than expected and has had to raise almost $250M in the process.
  \ Some, like [MedLion](https://medlion.com), are trying to sell subscription medicine,
  mainly virtual care, through employers.\n\nThe lessons from these companies is not
  that cash-pay medicine doesn’t work ([here’s data](https://stateofreform.com/news/industry/healthcare-providers/2015/01/qliance-study-shows-monthly-fee-primary-care-model-saves-20-percent-claims/)
  showing saving from cash pay), it’s that scaling a network of cash-pay medical practices
  is very hard in today’s healthcare environment. Cash-pay practices that hold old
  on and remain outside the system will be smaller, more independent practices. That’s
  the biggest obstacle to cash-pay medicine — converting small practices is hard and
  perceived as very risky. But, those smaller, independent cash-pay practices are
  starting to share their stories and insights through online forums. These online
  forums, like Facebook groups, are reducing the barriers for providers to convert
  practices to cash pay. I personally know multiple physicians who are planning to
  convert to cash-pay practices in 2018 and their main source of information is Facebook.\n\nAt
  the same time, consumers/patients are more open to cash-pay practices. As healthcare
  delivery and traditional, claims-based payment have become more convoluted, consumers
  have become more willing to pay directly for higher-level access to their providers.
  I don’t think a large portion of the public is ready to spend $150-$200/mo. for
  concierge medicine but I do think a decent proportion is willing to pay $40-70/mo.\n\nAs
  more providers leave traditional payor based healthcare to open cash-based practices,
  more consumers are willing to sign up. And, as that happens, we are seeing more
  digital health technologies built to help cash-based practices — [Hint Health](https://hint.com)
  manages the back office, [Atlas.MD](https://atlas.md) is a subscription-based practice
  EHR, and [Spruce Health](https://sprucehealth.com) connects providers directly to
  patients and allows practices to easily offer new, differentiated services to patients.
  This is the cycle that will push more cash-pay medicine into healthcare. \n\nCash-pay
  medicine is not for every provider and not for every consumer. But, it does fit
  well with a growing number of independent practices that want to remain viable and
  can’t survive against larger provider networks and health systems. I predict 2018
  will be the year that cash pay, subscription medicine becomes a real option for
  both providers and patients.\n\nFollow the healthcare trends series by subscribing

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

    and ACA) are neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health
    record (EHR) companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who
    support them. This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have
    delivered on the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the
    outcome of billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are
    here in 2018, and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and,
    by extension, patients.\n\nIn this third part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)
    series, I offer predictions of what we can expect to see in a post-EHR world. "
  :post: "\nToday, EHRs are in use by [95+% of eligible providers](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Hospital-Progress-to-Meaningful-Use-by-size-practice-setting-area-type.php).
    With that massive adoption, EHRs, at least the meaningful use certified EHRs deemed
    by the government worthy of carrot and stick adoption incentives, play two foundational
    roles in healthcare today.\n\n1. **EHRs are the hub of patient data.** They collect
    and store both subjective information and objective data from devices. They store
    reports and other kinds of file attachments. They store discrete data.\n2. **EHRs
    are the hub of clinical workflow.** Though EHRs are designed for general workflows,
    they don’t provide the tailored fit clinicians actually need forcing them to have
    to adapt their workflows to EHRs and not the other way around as it should be.
    Orders, messages, referrals, you name it. If providers are not entering or looking
    for data in the EHR, they are using the EHR to accomplish a task.\n\nThese two
    roles are foundational to building solutions, technology, or technology-enabled
    processes on top of the EHR; there are exceptions to this rule but, increasingly,
    even these exceptions are being forced to integrate. This changes everything,
    especially for those innovators in healthcare that are trying to develop solutions
    for providers and patients. But, almost as importantly, it forces EHRs to now
    either a) build new solutions themselves, b) support new 3rd party solutions,
    or c) risk replacement by newer EHRs that do either a or b. This process isn’t
    happening overnight, but it is happening.\n\nHealthcare technology tends to cycle
    every 15 years or so between best-of-breed solutions and all-in-one platforms.
    Today’s EHRs are at the tail end of a 15-year cycle that has seen their adoption
    grow massively as healthcare providers have implemented one of a few EHR options
    as platforms. Now, we are starting to cycle back to best-of-breed solutions as
    it has become abundantly clear that monolithic EHRs cannot develop solutions fast
    enough to meet the demands of the market. One platform cannot do everything. And
    EHRs, at least the major ones, are trying a mix of the a and b strategy above
    to hold their place as the central healthcare IT software.\n\n## EHRs still control
    access to patient data\n\nEHRs still control access to data and clinician workflows
    and have used that control to slow down adoption of new digital health solutions.
    EHRs have developed proprietary programs, or app stores/orchards/ programs, in
    attempts to support, whether that support is real or perceived, 3rd party solutions
    — Epic has App Orchard, Cerner has Cerner Cares, Allscripts has the Allscripts
    Developer Program, and Athena has More Disruption Please (there are more examples,
    but these are the big four). While programs from Athena and Allscripts are mature
    at this point, the emerging programs from Epic and Cerner have been slow to take
    off at best or failing at achieving any meaningful adoption at worst. The reasons
    for their slow take off or failure are partially technology-related (the app stores
    are proprietary) and partially business-model related (Apple can take 30% of app
    store partner revenue because Apple is the primary driver of revenue whereas EHRs
    are trying to collect 30% of revenue as a tax merely to integrate with them.)
    The $15-20K EHR integration price tag we grew to loathe is now a 30% tax on partner
    revenue.\n\nAt the same time EHRs try to support 3rd party applications, they
    are trying to build their own solutions to shut out digital health products. Every
    EHR now has a data warehousing solution, most have a population health tool, and
    many have telemedicine offerings. Similarly to Microsoft’s strategy of using its
    Windows and Office customer base to sell Azure cloud services, EHRs are trying
    to sell their own new products. The problem is none of the major EHRs are as savvy,
    either technically or business-wise, as Microsoft.\n\n## The Slow Burn of FHIR\n\nConcurrently,
    many major EHRs are supporting FHIR as a standard way to access EHR data. Some
    of that support may be vaporware, but most EHRs are at least announcing [FHIR
    capabilities](https://datica.com/guide/fhir/). FHIR has been in discussions for
    several years and, despite a lot of broad-based support, is moving painfully slowly
    towards adoption and actual implementation. Yes, the big four may support reading
    data from their EHRs via FHIR, but there is very little a real application can
    do by only reading data from the EHR. At times, the slow pace of FHIR adoption
    seems intentional by the many incumbents supporting it. Despite that, a recent
    survey found that health system CIOs consider FHIR to be the technology with the
    [most promise in 2018](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/news-item/interoperability/cios-see-fhir-potential-game-changer-and-blockchain-overhyped-survey),
    meaning FHIR is here to stay.\n\n## Is Replacing EHRs the Path Forward?\n\nIf
    EHRs are failing to support 3rd-party solutions and failing to develop and sell
    their own digital health products fast enough, does that leave option C — replacing
    EHRs — as the only path forward? \n\nNot exactly. \n\nAs both the hub of data
    and hub of clinical workflow, EHRs are extremely entrenched today. The vast majority
    of health system IT department resources are dedicated to supporting EHRs, so
    there are strange incentive conflicts. And, FHIR has been highly effective at
    buying EHRs more time.\n\nAs I said before, this process is not happening overnight,
    but it is happening. More industry leaders are [speaking out against EHRs](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180122/NEWS/180129979)
    and the rampant blocking of innovation so needed in healthcare. EHRs can only
    buy so much time. What I think we are going to see over the next 3-5 years, a
    time that also coincides with when a lot of health systems will have written down
    the heavy upfront capital expense of EHRs, is EHRs becoming less and less a clinical
    workflow tool and more and more a clinical encounter documentation tool and one
    source, not the primary hub, of clinical data.\n\nThere are two parts to that
    prediction. The first just means that we’re going to see purpose-built tools for
    specific workflows. We already see that today with clinical communication tools
    like [Voalte](http://www.voalte.com/) that are making the lives of nurses easier
    by enabling them to use a fast, mobile, purpose-built platform for their workflows
    and communications. The second is piggybacking on the inevitable march toward
    continuous and complete patient data. EHR data today is episodic. Clinical data
    tomorrow will include episodic EHR data but also remote monitoring data, social
    data, genetic data, and always-on sensor data. The EHR data will be one part of
    a much larger puzzle. I think the EHRs of today, the large ones I mention in this
    post, have too much technical debt to move fast enough to serve as the hub of
    clinical data tomorrow. They are saddled with their history.\n\n## 6 Predictions
    about EHRs in 2018\n\nPredictions are easy when you don’t have specific timelines.
    So what do I think we’ll see with EHRs and clinical data in 2018?\n\n1. **More
    direct patient access to EHR data.** There was already a major announcement of
    [Apple enabling its customers to access Epic and Cerner data](https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/apple-health-app-effort-to-engage-consumers-by-sharing-ehr-info).\n2.
    **More available production FHIR services.** Most of these will be couched as
    pilots or beta, but progress is progress. FHIR will also be used for direct patient
    access to data.\n3. **Social determinants of health matter…a lot.** Everybody
    always cites studies that show WHO data of high US healthcare spending with resultant
    lousy health outcomes. This is true. And sad. But it’s not the whole story. In
    the US, we spend far less on social programs and services than most countries
    that beat our health outcomes. The result is a health system that doubles as a
    social safety net, with all costs incurred by the health system. Social data and
    care based on that data will be a major shift in 2018, and I think most of that
    will happen outside the EHR, at least regarding data sources and storage.\n4.
    **Demand for data access by EHR customers.** One of the challenges when integrating
    with an EHR is that the default answer is usually “no”. There is invariably friction
    to overcome and it is up to the health system to overcome this friction. I think
    2018 we will see a lot less acceptance of “no” and more pushing for EHRs to open
    up access to data, whether that data is exposed via FHIR or HL7 v2.x or a proprietary
    API middle layer like that provided by Sansoro Health.\n5. **Mega-mergers require
    new strategies around data sharing from unwilling players.** Large-scale mergers
    like Dignity/CHI and Providence-St. Joseph’s/Ascension will show vendors willing
    to demonstrate a more willing ability to play nice so that they don’t lose market
    share as hundreds of hospital sites are brought under one IT umbrella for the
    sake of efficiency. Epic has already shown some cards around this with their [Come
    Together/Happy Together/Working Together](https://www.epic.com/epic/post/3222)
    trio, but it’s hard to say if it’ll stave off mega losses in the usual hospital
    merger shakeup where two EHR vendors enter and only [one leaves](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ehr/advocate-health-care-aurora-healthcare-epic-ehr-merger-care-coordination).\n6.
    **More ambulatory EHR providers bite the dust.** Now that the dust of Meaningful
    Use has settled, more companies are beginning to evaluate if they want to stay
    at the EHR table. With Allscripts acquiring both McKesson’s EHR suite and Practice
    Fusion (at a loss), anticipating more contraction in the EHR space as disinterested
    players try to divest assets while they are still holding water (GE Centricity,
    Greenway) seems like a safe bet. \n\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might want

  :summary: In this fourth part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series, Travis Good,
    MD explores what we can expect to see as clinicians broaden their skillsets into
    digital health.
  :blog_lead: |
    Clinicians, in particular physicians, have always played a significant role in healthcare. Some call it an outsized role with an outsized voice; but, the last 20 years have seen a significant decline in physician autonomy as payors have stepped in to more closely oversee and dictate, via reimbursements, how clinicians practice and provide care while more and more health system has employed physicians and taken them out of independent practices. These are just the trends. There are market forces creating and sustaining these trends.

    In this fourth part of our [2018 Healthcare Trends](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/) series, I explore what we can expect to see as clinicians broaden their skillsets into digital health.
  :post: "\nOne huge recent trend is the implementation of EHRs. Today, clinicians
    spend more time in the EHR than any other activity; this [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675713004051)
    found ER doctors spent 44% of their time on data entry and only 28% on direct
    patient care. Doctors have been forced, again for various good and bad reasons,
    to document data in a certain way and a certain format. The EHR adoption of the
    last 15 years has been driven by non-clinical forces.\n\nToday, we see new trends
    in technology beyond the EHR. New digital health technology is being [developed
    and adopted](https://datica.com/blog/digital-health-apps-could-save-7-billion/)
    for everything from clinical communications to telemedicine. With this increased
    technology fragmentation, as opposed to the [monolithic EHR era](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/),
    we are in a time of letting 1,000 flowers bloom. And clinicians are taking the
    opportunity to influence, build, and deliver these new digital health solutions.\n\n##
    Physicians as makers of digital health products\n\nDoctors, individually and as
    a group, are an interesting group. Painting with a very broad brush, doctors as
    a group are hard-working self-starters who believe they can do a lot of things
    well. They are also intimately knowledgeable about healthcare delivery, having
    spent thousands of hours in clinical settings in training and practice. Considering
    that, it’s not surprising to see more and more physicians designing and sometimes
    building digital health technologies.\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that this trend
    of clinicians as developers is in stark contrast in so many ways to the EHR proliferation
    era we are now exiting. While EHRs were developed to enable workflows, most clinicians
    conformed to the workflows of the EHR, not the other way around; EHRs can be customized
    to clinician workflows, but they rarely are in practice. Now, what we’re seeing
    is more and more clinicians developing technology to meet their own bespoke, or
    customized, workflows. That’s why it’s 1000s of blooming flowers of new clinician-designed
    and built digital health technologies.\n\nYes, some clinicians are attempting
    to build sizeable digital health business meant to scale, but that’s not who I’m
    talking about in this post. I’m talking about clinicians, typically academic or
    independent practice, developing solutions for their day to day. There are often
    plans to commercialize and scale these bespoke solutions, but this is challenging
    because of the customized nature of the solutions.\n\n## Risks and Challenges
    for Clinicians\n\nDespite the potential upside of digital health bringing efficiencies
    to clinician practices by automating or improving workflows, there are risks and
    challenges inherent to this approach, especially for health systems and academic
    medical centers. At Datica, we see this time and time again as health systems
    grapple to inventory all of the tools being built and used. This is the struggle
    of [shadow IT](https://datica.com/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives/).\n\nThe
    reason this is happening is that clinicians have digital health technologies they
    want to build, or have already developed. They want to put these technologies
    to use in their practices. And, often, the traditional IT channels are too slow
    or don’t have the physician or human resources available. Today, more than ever
    before, there are no barriers to deploying and managing your own IT resources,
    so that is typically what clinicians do.\n\nAs this becomes more widespread, and
    it’s already pretty common, we’re going to see more and more health systems develop
    strategies to enable clinicians as developers. The solution is likely not through
    traditional IT, at least unless traditional IT embraces cloud and new paradigms
    of technology delivery. What’s more likely is that formal innovation or digital
    strategies will develop that balance the needs of clinician developers with the
    needs of health systems to know what technologies are being used in their organization
    and where their patient data is flowing.\n\nI Invite you to also take a look at
    the first two trends we’ve already explored in this series: How [cash-pay practices
    will grow in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/)

  :summary: 'The “real cloud” in healthcare is not virtualization. We are talking
    about the public cloud and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. '
  :blog_lead: |-
    Information technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a [colossal chunk](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/electronic-health-records-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html) of their time supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors, health system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to EHRs, hospital IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies, that require care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications and you quickly see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog.

    At the same time, a significant strategic priority for healthcare organizations is assessing the cloud, developing a cloud strategy, and implementing that strategy. Most organizations are at some stage in this process. Many are still pre-implementation of a cloud strategy. But, it’s coming. And the health IT backlog is not conducive to the massive amount of work required to start moving technology to the cloud.
  :post: "\nWhat I mean by the cloud or the “real cloud” in my initial [2018 Healthcare
    Trends post](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/), is
    not virtualization. What I mean is the [public cloud](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
    and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The public cloud
    is not Epic hosting in Verona, with a data center that is managed and operated
    by Epic, or Cerner hosting in Kansas City, with a data center that is managed
    and operated by Cerner; those are private clouds dedicated to a specific application
    and purpose. The public cloud is different.\n\nThe public cloud is a powerful
    public utility and a force that will transform healthcare, not just healthcare
    IT. It is almost infinitely scalable with a growing laundry list of services and
    features that can be activated and accessed on demand. And, with new security
    features, it is now finally ready for prime time, meaning only that it is ready
    for healthcare organizations to develop and implement cloud strategies. The public
    cloud will enable many things for healthcare organizations.\n\n## The public cloud
    will:\n\n1. Get healthcare organizations out of the data center and infrastructure
    business, allowing focus on providing care, better services, and better products
    (meds and devices)\n2. Massively improve disaster recovery, aiding in meeting
    compliance requirements\n3. Accelerate innovation, enabling faster response and
    adaptation to market changes\n4. Improve and ease access to health data both for
    providers and patients\n5. Enhance visibility into security and compliance\n6.
    Enable new partnerships and integrations.\n\nDespite the scale and challenges
    of moving to the cloud, the cloud is coming to healthcare, and it’s coming faster
    than most people think. Look no further than HIMSS 2018 and the newly enlarged
    presence of major cloud providers Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. Healthcare on the cloud is strategic for every cloud
    provider. The challenge for these three behemoths is being in healthcare at the
    right time. These cloud providers are at HIMSS in 2018 because now is the right
    time, not because 2018 will be the year all healthcare organizations will move
    all their technology to the cloud; but, 2018 and 2019 will be the years most healthcare
    organizations start to implement a cloud strategy that will take years to execute.
    Microsoft, Amazon, and Google can’t miss those opportunities.\n\nI was listening
    to a [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/13/box-kubernetes-migration-with-sam-ghods/)
    podcast last week featuring one of the founders of [Box](https://www.box.com/home).
    The podcast focused on how Box has embraced the public cloud and why they have
    chosen to leverage Kubernetes. It’s a fascinating listen. One of the takeaways
    that map to the cloud trend in health IT is around how moving to the cloud is
    never one and done, even if you only have one large, monolithic application (in
    the case of the podcast, the one application was Box).\n\n## Hybrid cloud for
    3-5 more years\n\nDuring the next 3-5 years, we’re going to see a hybrid approach
    to the cloud for health IT where there is a mix of cloud applications and ground-based,
    or on-premise applications. This necessitates a new integration strategy to ensure
    secure and reliable connectivity between cloud and existing ground applications,
    not just integration between legacy applications and new applications; ground
    applications are typically legacy applications. This hybrid cloud strategy also
    necessitates management of multiple forms of technology infrastructure, cloud,
    and ground or on-premise.\n\n## Legacy applications either killed off or re-architected
    for public cloud\n\nAs healthcare organizations implement and start to scale their
    cloud strategies, more ground-based applications will move to the public cloud.
    Some set of these legacy applications, likely the last to move to the cloud, will
    be migrated as they are currently architected; that, or they’ll be sunsetted and
    killed off before they are migrated. Many more of these legacy ground applications
    will be re-architected as a part of the migration process. The reason to re-architect
    legacy applications is to:\n\n1) fully take advantage of the cloud (auto-scaling,
    auto-healing, redundancy, portability, etc.) and\n2) prevent lock-in with a specific
    cloud provider. \n\nWhile AWS, Azure, and GCP offer great cloud services and resources,
    healthcare organizations will want optionality and to avoid lock-in with cloud
    providers APIs and the specific flavor of services (containers, serverless, etc.).
    This re-architecture process will be a crucial part of the cloud strategy for
    healthcare organizations.\n\n## Public cloud requires new skillsets\n\nThe public
    cloud does require a unique skill set and should usher in a new paradigm (containers,
    security, serverless, DBaaS, etc.) for healthcare technologies. Hiring resources
    with the necessary skillsets are challenging to say the least. It’s challenging
    if you’re in Seattle or Boston. It’s nearly impossible if you’re in a rural location
    like many healthcare organizations. Access to the right skillsets to leverage
    public cloud will improve over time but health systems should, and likely will,
    leverage third parties that specialize in cloud computing; these third parties
    have matured along with the public cloud.\n\n## Security and compliance — a big
    challenge\n\nOne particularly outsized challenge associated with the cloud is
    security and compliance. The cloud has distinct advantages over the current, on-premise
    model but it also has the perceptive challenge of giving up the keys to the castle
    to a cloud provider. This perceptive challenge can and will be overcome, but it
    requires changes to the way healthcare organizations manage risk for their data
    and how they align that risk with liability from cloud providers acting as stewards
    of their data. Transparency, both legally in the form of [BAAs](https://datica.com/blog/the-importance-of-business-associate-agreements-baas/)
    and [data processing agreements](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/) and technically
    in the form of security dashboards, have never been more critical.\n\n\nIn leveraging
    third parties, both cloud providers for infrastructure and cloud specialists for
    migration, security, and compliance, healthcare IT and healthcare compliance will
    transform themselves. What those groups look like in a post-cloud world is hard
    to say, but it’s clear they will have to change to embrace this brave new world.
    This will not happen overnight.\n\nA lot of the above are impacts that will be
    felt long-term and not necessarily in 2018. But, as healthcare organizations begin
    their [journey to the cloud](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/),
    some starting that journey at HIMSS this year, they need to consider all of this.
    Cloud strategies should be all-encompassing but also should be revisited on some

  :summary: Where is healthcare going in 2018? In this sixth piece of the Datica Healthcare
    Trends series, we explore the fifth trend — moving beyond the digital health hype.
  :blog_lead: "Where is healthcare going in 2018? In the first article of Datica’s
    2018 Healthcare Trends series, I outlined [six trends for 2018](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/).
    I predict volatility as the government, individuals, and private sector demand
    change this year. In this sixth piece of the series, I explore the fifth trend
    — moving beyond the digital health hype.\n\nOver the last ten years, digital health
    has been met with much ballyhoo and corresponding investment. Even the “digital
    health” term has become broad and beyond its original intent. It’s helpful to
    define the term before diving into its evolution and current state. According
    to Wikipedia, [the digital health discipline is described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health)
    in the following way — “The discipline involves the use of information and communication
    technologies to help address the health problems and challenges faced by patients.” "
  :post: "\nThat’s broad. Very broad. \n\nDigital health is somewhat  synonymous with
    “healthcare technology,” with one caveat — healthcare technology is inclusive
    of electronic health records (EHRs) and I personally don’t group EHRs in with
    the broader digital health term.\n\nLike other verticals and in many consumer
    products, digital health has followed a similar trend. We saw initial hype around
    mobility, connectivity and consumerization of healthcare. While those trends are
    still relevant, healthcare, as yet has not been disrupted or upgraded to the same
    extent as industries like banking, retail, and even education. Those who have
    been in healthcare for a while have read a multitude of stories touting new companies
    and technologies that were destined to disrupt healthcare. All of those, except
    a select few, have failed. \n\nHere are a few of the obstacles digital health
    companies must overcome.\n\n## Scrutiny of technology spend is way up and proof
    is the antidote\n\nIn 2018, healthcare technology has finally [moved past the
    EHR era](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/). EHRs
    are now ubiquitous in healthcare organizations. As we all learned at HIMSS18,
    the good old days of Meaningful Use are over. However, one lingering consequence
    of Meaningful Use was an increase of the percentage of technology spend in most
    health systems budgets. That increased spend is now being scrutinized, and digital
    health must demonstrate solid proof of efficacy to overcome that scrutiny and
    succeed.\n\nIn the [Digital Health Success Framework (DHSF)](https://datica.com/dhsf/)
    Datica outlined the major challenges that digital health developers must traverse.
    Now, more than ever, digital health products need associated proof to overcome
    buyer and customer skepticism. The proof can broadly fall into the following buckets
    — lowering costs, improving care (especially in at-risk settings), and improving
    the care experience.\n\n## VCs invest in scalable technologies, but healthcare
    is siloed and localized \n\nVenture capital compounds the challenges of digital
    health. Building and scaling new technology products to meet venture capital demands
    falls out of alignment with selling and implementing demands of digital health
    within the enterprise. The localized nature of healthcare exacerbates the problem.
    Even for some larger systems that still buy technology at local or regional levels,
    one must wonder if most digital health technologies aren’t meant to be venture
    scale. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSome digital health companies have
    found success with a focus on localization. Those companies have discovered that
    while you may not be able to change the way care is delivered for millions of
    people you can, however, do that in one city. Scale in healthcare doesn’t have
    to be geographically global. Scaling to thousands of health systems is daunting,
    since many are finding ways to solve their problems without waiting for a well-funded
    digital health startup to save the day. \n\nOver the past year, I’ve talked to
    multiple investors who say they see many digital health companies solving the
    same problems with similar solutions, and all at similar stages ($1 - $2 million
    in annual revenue and 2-5 customers in the same geography). Who gets funded and
    how do they scale with anything resembling efficiency?\n\nEHRs don’t help the
    problem of scaling. Without a centralized clinical data repository; thousands
    of EHR silos exist all over the U.S. Selling to one Epic hospital is selling to
    one Epic hospital. You must go through the same extended implementation for each
    new hospital, with all the associated built-in pushback.\n\n## Proof and scale
    are necessary, but are they even possible?\n\nWhere does that leave us? Is there
    a way to 1) prove the ROI of a digital health product, and 2) scale that success
    quickly? I’m not sure. The system seems to be set up to prevent that from happening.
    The biggest companies I know that are strategically focused on getting into digital
    health, and these are some of the biggest companies in the world, are playing
    a very long game. Those companies know that success, at least regarding scale,
    is going to take many, many years. And they have the money and patience to play
    it out.\n\nThese companies are targeting providers because they are seen as the
    key to healthcare as the actual place of the transaction — care delivered and
    care received. Life sciences are sometimes seen as a faster path to success, but
    there are only so many life sciences companies and the investments those companies
    are making in digital health, and their strategies for digital health, are similarly
    long game strategies that involve being closer to care delivery.\n\nDespite the
    doom and gloom of the last few paragraphs, digital health will have a significant
    impact on healthcare. The question is timing. Regardless of the when, the how
    is clear — digital health needs to be able to prove it’s worth to get into the
    hands of patients and providers.\n\n"
