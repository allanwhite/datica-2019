  in 2018. If you’re not already thinking about Kubernetes or at least containerization,
  then you’re behind. Fortunately, containers and cloud native architectures have
  never been more accessible or easier to get started with. From infrastructure providers
  like AWS and Azure offering their own versions of managed Kubernetes, to organizations
  like Cloud Foundry offering Kubernetes services, the world is shifting toward containers.

  Trends Part 2: Cash-Pay Practices Will Grow.__ Where is healthcare going in 2018?
  In the first article in this series, I outlined six trends for 2018 I predict we’ll
  see as the government, individuals, and private sector demand change this year.
  The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay practices. Whether you call
  it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary care, or concierge medicine,
  the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors. [_continue reading_](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/)\n3.
  __6 Healthcare Trends to Watch in 2018.__  It’s 2018, and the world looks much different
  than it did a year ago. Go back even further and the differences are even more stark.
  No place is that more evident than in healthcare. As the largest industry in the
  world, healthcare has weathered the most significant political waves of the last
  fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare increased unchecked, politicians took
  notice. [_continue reading_](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/)\n4.
  __What Exactly is a Digital Health Application?.__ Digital health is something of

  __2018 Healthcare Trends Part 3: 6 Predictions for the Post-EHR World.__  Sadly,
  the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH and ACA) are neither
  patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health record (EHR) companies
  and the cottage industry of consultants and services who support them. This isn’t
  an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have delivered on the promise of
  the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the outcome of billions of dollars
  spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are here in 2018, and EHRs play a central
  role in the daily lives of providers and, by extension, patients. This third part
  of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series offers predictions of what we can expect to

  __2018 Healthcare Trends Part 5: The Real Cloud Comes to Healthcare.__ Information
  technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a colossal chunk of their time
  supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors, health
  system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to EHRs, hospital
  IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies, that require
  care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications and you quickly
  see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog. [_continue reading_](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n7.

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

    \nThere’s often a buzz of recap news stories at the end of each year followed
    by a flurry of predictions posts for the coming new year. We’ve done this before
    in a few different ways at Datica. The prediction posts are usually specific and
    often wrong in that specificity. For 2017 I’m going to do things differently.
    Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll present four high-level trends that
    follow the broad directional shifts driving healthcare in 2017 and beyond. These
    overarching trends are creating turmoil and uncertainty, new problems across all

    \nThis 3rd part of the 2017 healthcare trends series looks at problems with EHRs,
    raising the question of whether their peak value has already passed. Meaningful
    Use (MU) is dead but it succeeded wildly in increasingly the adoption of EHRs.
    In fact, MU was so successful that physicians have become the most overtrained
    and overpriced data entry workers in our economy. All of this data entry has been
    at the expense of patient care as evidenced by the time and attention given to
    record keeping and not spending time with patients. To be clear, there are benefits
    to EHRs in terms of standardizing documenting, analytics, and billing.  \n*[Continue

    CDN network to leak sensitive data across unrelated requests. Depending on who
    you ask this is either an unfortunate bug, a serious problem, or a historic event.
    \n\nAt Datica we often get asked about how content distribution networks (CDNs)
    relate to maintaining HIPAA compliance. Are you allowed to use them in a web application?
    If so, what are the restrictions? What are the issues you have to be wary of?
    As it turns out there’s a specific part of HIPAA legislation that relates strongly

    \nIn a recent research report, Datica uncovered interesting trends in digital
    health, including healthcare cloud trends. One of the interesting trends we discovered
    was that, within healthcare, the definition of cloud is no longer only scoped
    to SaaS any longer as it had been in the recent past. In fact, healthcare companies
    are turning to cloud infrastructure services to help manage costs and increasing
    complexities.  \n\nIn 2017, 75% of hospital CIOs plan to use IaaS services within
    the next year — up from just 15.3% in 2014. In light of this trend, we thought
    it a good time to once again define the three service delivery models prevalent
    in healthcare companies today. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/)*\n\n**[The
    Accelerating Migration to the Healthcare Cloud](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/):**
    \nI saw an article recently titled, “Hospital datacenters: Extinct in 5 years?”
    that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
    place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at
    last year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center
    environment and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry
    is notoriously the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race
    to the cloud has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.
    Even so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health
    systems today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
    from $3.73 billion in 2015 to $9.48 billion by 2020. \n\nIn this article, we explore
    the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits of cloud computing
    in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/)*\n\n**[Announcing
    One-click Installations of Mirth Connect and Open Source Connectors](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/):**
    \nToday we are launching one-click installations of Mirth Connect combined with
    Open-Source Connectors. It is the next evolution of how we help solve the problem
    of healthcare data integration. The switch to a more open solution is a testament
    to our enduring commitment to helping customers with integration in the best way
    possible. Healthcare developers can get started on new projects faster, and benefit
    from three years of learning. \n\nWe aim to empower the developer community to
    solve the problem of integration themselves with tools that are open, reliable,
    compliant, and secure. The launch is based on consistent feedback that customers
    need more flexibility, more control over their integration environments, better
    pricing at scale, and future-proofing for things like FHIR and the Epic App Orchard
    and Cerner Code. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/announcing-one-click-installations-of-mirth-connect-and-open-source/)*\n\n**[5
    Steps to HITRUST Certification](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/):**
    \n“If I’m being honest, I’d tell that the process we went through to achieve HITRUST
    CSF Certification was incredibly painful. It was time consuming and resource intensive
    beyond our wildest expectations. Personally, as the Datica Privacy Officer and
    point person for HITRUST, I was taxed beyond anything I expected,” said Dr. Travis
    Good, Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Privacy Officer of Datica. \n\nComplying with
    HIPAA and proving it are two different things. Datica is HIPAA compliant. We can
    point you to the documentation we’ve created to show how we comply with all the
    various HIPAA rules. But, ultimately, because there is no true HIPAA certification,
    the only way to prove HIPAA compliance is to go through 3rd party audits as we
    have at Datica. Our customers leverage those audits to prove the infrastructure
    they use is HIPAA compliant. Basically, we do all this work to make proving compliance
    easier for our customers. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/)*\n\n**[Opportunities
    for Digital Health Vendors in the Pharmaceutical Industry](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/):**
    \nNaomi Fried, PhD is a highly experienced thought leader in healthcare innovation
    and digital health, with many years of innovation experience. Most recently, as
    Biogen’s first VP of Innovation, Medical Information, and External Partnerships,
    she led five functions that catalyzed innovation to support patients and healthcare
    professionals. She developed the strategy for and led the “innovation beyond the
    molecule” program to deliver non-pharmacological value to patients and providers.
    In our July, 2017 podcast \n\nDr. Travis Good interviewed Dr. Fried, resulting
    in a lively chat about the differences between the way pharma and hospital systems
    innovate, as well as the advantages digital health vendors can tap when working
    with pharma. Here were a few key takeaways from the podcast. \n*[Continue Reading](https://datica.com/blog/opportunities-for-digital-health-vendors-in-pharma/)*\n"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
