:blog_lead: 'Migrating organizational data to the cloud is one of a number of concerns

  a survey on the topic [during and after HIMSS18](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/healthcare-cios-say-lift-and-shift-to-cloud-not-on-radar/).
  Members of the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) answered
  questions regarding their organizations’ plans and efforts to move their data to
  the cloud. The results reveal that many healthcare organizations are in a holding
  pattern. '
:post: "Cloud storage has the potential to change healthcare in positive ways, from
  administration efficiencies to population health. An array of new opportunities
  for providers await when moving data storage into the cloud. But, there’s a long
  way to go before that potential can be realized.\n\n## Cloud adoption is a top priority,
  but not in full throttle mode\n\nAbout 80% of the survey respondents said that cloud
  hosting is in the top 20 priorities within their organizations; however, only around
  30% said they have a strategy for that data migration. Such massive operational
  changes take time. We need only look at healthcare’s recent past with implementation
  of electronic health records (EHRs) to see the truth in that statement. \n\n*JUST
  RELEASED: Get Datica’s [2018 CIO Cloud Perspectives Survey here](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/healthcare-cloud-take-off-waiting-for-fog-clear/)*\n\nThose
  organizations that have already made the cloud leap are innovating: 32% are using
  the cloud to build machine learning applications, and 45% are creating applications
  to improve population health. With the possibility of such uses, why are some organizations
  hesitating? \n\nOne of the biggest concerns survey respondents cite is around security.
  Roughly 50% said it is a primary worry. Given the regulatory landscape and the sensitivity
  of protected health information (PHI), it’s not surprising that security is a top
  concern. As cloud hosting becomes a more viable option, new tools are emerging to
  give healthcare organizations greater control over their data, which will help dissipate
  concerns about data security. \n\nAnother barrier for some organizations is the
  lack of a clear business value in storing data in the cloud. About 40% of the executives
  who took the survey said that things like what to do with existing equipment or
  how their organization would make practical use of cloud storage impedes the shift.\n\n##
  Some are taking to the cloud, others remain grounded\n\nAlmost 20% of survey respondents
  reported that their organizations are already hosting 50% or more of their software
  infrastructure remotely. An additional 14% said at least a quarter to half of their
  infrastructure is hosted remotely. That means just over one-third of the organizations
  represented in the Datica survey are discovering what works, what possibilities
  are opened, and how the cloud might improve healthcare delivery. \n\nConversely,
  about 20% of the executives said that migrating data storage to the cloud was not
  a current priority for their organization. [Regulatory compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/),
  security, and privacy are all concerns, among others. \n\nIn the broadest terms,
  the survey seems to show that executives are aware of the potential of the cloud,
  both for improving healthcare delivery as well as for data breaches. As is always
  the case, some organizations are innovating and pushing the limits of what is possible,
  while others take a wait-and-see attitude. \n\n\n"

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

    the digital health transformation through four articles from major industry publications.
    The report also examines insights from Accenture and the World Economic Forum
    surveys, and takes a look at HIMSS 2018. "
  :post: "## Surprising digital health trends reported by the media\n\nFeaturing stories
    from The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Harvard Business Review, and Healthtech
    News, Datica’s Spring 2018 innovation report finds that there are some specific,
    and perhaps surprising trends in digital innovation. From hospitals supporting
    startups to the competition for data that artificial intelligence is bringing
    about, the four articles touch on current hot button topics. \n\nIn a story titled
    [“Hospitals Fund Potential Game-Changers in Health Tech”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-vie-to-fund-a-health-tech-breakthrough-1520430189)
    the Wall Street Journal reports on how some hospitals are beginning to fund health-tech
    startups in the hopes of supporting innovation that will result in improvements.
    Hospitals are in a good position to decide which innovative projects to support
    because hospitals have the clearest understanding of their own problems that need
    to be solved. \n\nThe Economist tackles the topic of medical data and technologies
    surrounding it in an article titled [“Data and medicine: A revolution in healthcare
    is coming.”](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming)
    Applications that detect heart arrhythmia or that have diagnostics capabilities
    are powerful, as are those that may improve the management of chronic disease.
    However, the article misses the mark in its implication that those types of technologies
    are on the verge of widespread adoption. Such innovations will change healthcare,
    but it will happen gradually. \n\nPatient-centered is a phrase that appears in
    almost every discussion of digital health innovation, and the Harvard Business
    Review examines the importance of keeping the patient front and center in an article
    titled [“Putting Humans at the Center of Health Care Innovation.”](https://hbr.org/2018/03/putting-humans-at-the-center-of-health-care-innovation)
    Innovation is most important when it puts people, rather than money, at the center.
    \n\nAdvancing innovation in digital health is going to require a migration to
    the cloud, according to an article in Healthtech News titled [“Eric Schmidt lays
    out formula for healthcare innovation.”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/eric-schmidt-lays-out-formula-healthcare-innovation)
    Moving to the cloud will mean having an infrastructure that is tested, interoperable,
    and secure. However, AI is going to require data acquisition because it depends
    on large datasets to determine algorithmic success. \n\n## Reports from the Experts\n\nReports
    from institutions, academic organizations, and consulting firms often contain
    insights that aren’t always obvious from interactions with partners and customers.
    The Datica spring innovation report includes summaries from two such reports:
    the [Accenture Digital Health Technology Vision 2017](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-digital-health-tech-vision-2017)
    and the [World Economic Forum report.](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/healthcare-building-a-digital-healthcare-system/)
    \n\nEach of the reports points to trends that are going to impact the digital
    health transformation. AI, digital ecosystems, open marketplaces for talent, the
    need for better understanding human behavior, and entirely new digital industries
    are all mentioned in the Accenture report. The World Economic Forum included discussion
    of how to build a digital healthcare system that will empower people. \n\n## Heavyweights
    at HIMSS18\n\nMicrosoft has always been involved in [HIMSS](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/himss18-recap-invasion-major-tech-providers/),
    but this year their focus was less on Azure and more on the Microsoft solutions
    on the cloud. AWS had a bigger presence than ever before at HIMSS, and featured
    demonstrations of solutions to specific healthcare problems. \n\nGoogle put on
    a show bigger than either Microsoft or AWS, with a major booth and high profile
    sessions and keynotes. However, it wasn’t clear exactly what cloud-based solutions
    Google is offering the healthcare sector. \n\nTelehealth and population health
    have matured. They are no longer coming soon but have arrived. Both technologies
    are now part of the health IT landscape. \n\nIT was also clear at HIMSS18 that
    there’s more innovation happening than necessarily meets the eye. New projects
    in digital health products as well as internal innovation within organizations
    are likely to spur rapid improvements in the near future. \n\nThe full [Datica
    Spring 2018 innovation report](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/report-q1-2018-digital-health-transformation/)
    elucidates the sources currently driving the digital health transformation. By
    pulling together unique perspectives on disparate topics, Datica clearly describes
    the innovation situation and how it’s impacting digital health. \t\t\t\t\t\n"

  :summary: 'Datica''s Winter 2017 quarterly industry report examines the paradox
    of shadow IT in healthcare. Is it a security threat or enabler for innovation? '
  :blog_lead: "[The Winter installment of Datica's quarterly industry report is now
    available](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives).
    The report examines shadow IT as both a growing security threat to health IT,
    but also as a unique and unrivaled enabler for innovation when managed appropriately.
    Shadow IT as a topic is quite the paradox—this report tries to help make sense
    of it."
  :post: "The changes in one year between 2017's AWS re:Invent conference and this
    year's edition were stark. We [blogged](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/aws-fargate-and-hipaa-compliant-containers/)
    about [some](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/)
    of our [observations](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/).
    In certain ways, the topic of shadow IT was a polarizing conversation throughout
    the conference. On the one hand, most vendors at the conference were promoting
    tools to control costs, security, and compliance of AWS so as to curb factions
    of shadow IT development. But on the other hand, David Deas, Corporate Director
    of Innovation and Knowledge Analytics at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare in Memphis,
    [got up on stage and talked about how HIPAA compliant and HITRUST certified versions
    of \"shadow IT\" became a defining enabler for his institutions initiatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju3cVT5YBo).\n\nIt's
    that dichotomy we've heard throughout 2017 and chose to examine in Q4's report.\n\nReaders
    will find a timely, in-depth summary of AWS re:Invent 2017 from the point of view
    of health IT.\n\nWe scoured what the industry has to say, and extracted the most
    important points of information for readers. We also went to see what the analysts
    are saying.\n\nAs with the [Spring report's](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/heart-of-medicine-report-spring-2017/)
    op-ed from [Dr. John Halamka, CIO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center](http://geekdoctor.blogspot.com/),
    we were graced with Sue Schade's point of view in this report. \n\nFew people
    have had to grapple with the challenges of shadow IT like Sue throughout her career.
    Back in 2015, [we interviewed Sue](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/sue-schade/)
    for our Healthcare Innovators series (since then has been converted to a [podcast](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/podcast/)
    format). She shared stories and gave solid advice about managing shadow IT in
    her role as CIO of Hospital and Health Centers at Michigan Medicine at the time.
    We are thrilled she was willing to give insight to the topic.\n\nWe hope you enjoy.
    Thanks for reading!"

    healthcare.
  :blog_lead: A couple weeks ago at HIMSS, we hosted a [CHIME](https://chimecentral.org)
    focus group with about twenty CIOs. The group CIOs represented public and private
    healthcare organizations, children’s and specialty hospitals, academic centers,
    and large integrated networks from across the country. It’s safe to say it was
    a broad swath of the provider market. The purpose of the conversation was not
    to try to sell Datica. Our goal was to have a discussion to gauge readiness, strategies,
    and maturity of the [cloud in healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/healthcare-cloud/),
    specifically the public cloud (AWS, Azure, and Google).
  :post: |-
    Despite the diversity of organizations represented, the feedback and discussion with the focus group CIOs demonstrated consistency of high-level thinking about the cloud for healthcare delivery organizations. We’re sharing our findings from the session because we fundamentally believe transparency in healthcare technology and healthcare on the cloud benefits the entire industry, including Datica. Below are the topics we covered and the salient points we took away.

    ## What is the cloud?

    This garnered a lot of interesting responses like “a new way to spend money” and “x as a service”. It’s definitely something CIOs are looking at and, in some use cases, using; but, the universal sentiment was that the cloud isn’t going to solve immediate problems facing CIOs. Another interesting insight was that the cloud was seen as a new way to spend money. In the near-to-medium term, as healthcare organizations work directly with cloud service providers or through partners and business associates that are using the cloud, healthcare organizations are going to be managing both on-premise technology as well as spending on cloud. One quote I wrote down was “you can’t justify the move to the cloud for ROI alone”. One CIO mentioned vendors misrepresent the cloud when they pitch it as a cost savings to CIOs with his comment, “cloud providers have to make a margin”.

    ## What are the major roadblocks to the cloud?

    The major roadblocks to the cloud elucidated were competing priorities, security (more on that later), and human capital. Given the consensus of the cloud having a questionable ROI, or a long-term ROI at best, it makes sense that it’s not high on the priority list for CIOs when the majority of their resources are still dedicated to the care and feeding of EHRs. Additionally, we’ve discovered in other conversations that the human capital CIOs do have aren’t cloud, devops, or dev sec ops experts. One other point of feedback was a loss of control associated with a lack of support when moving to the cloud.

    ## How are you using the cloud today?

    With the exception of a couple CIOs mainly representing ancillary service providers, the major use of cloud today were things I’d classify as pet projects, or non-core IT projects. The cloud was being used in innovation, research, and by partners/vendors/business associates. The great cloud migration, or the lift and shift story, is definitely not happening at scale any time soon.

    ## How are you solving security and compliance on the cloud?

    There was not a consensus on how healthcare enterprises are solving the challenges of security and compliance on the cloud. Every CIO acknowledged the importance of security but it is definitely something organizations seem to still be figuring out. There were challenges around cloud security that most of the CIOs acknowledged were not solved problems.

    ## How are you validating 3rd party security on the cloud?

    This was an interesting one. I’ve always speculated that there is no way for healthcare organizations to effectively assess the security of their vendors when it comes to the cloud. Healthcare security and compliance groups don’t have the resources and cannot dedicate the time to verify everything from vendor policies and procedures to technical configurations. In the world of cloud, this challenge is compounded by the number and dynamic nature of available cloud services. Because of this, I’ve thought [HITRUST](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) would succeed as a proxy for bespoke security reviews. To some extent it has and most CIOs at our focus group were considering or already going down the path of HITRUST. But, the universal sentiment we got was that health systems felt they had to be able to do their own security reviews of 3rd parties. They viewed the risk as only partially tied to financial risk of data breach. The major concern we heard was reputation damage to the org and potential scale of a breach on the cloud.

    ## Is Shadow IT a concern at your organization?

    Based on feedback we’d gotten during many of our [Healthcare Innovators](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/) podcasts, we published a report last year on [Shadow IT in Healthcare](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/innovation/shadow-it-in-healthcare-cloud-cover-for-innovation-initiatives/). We know Shadow IT is an important topic for healthcare provider organizations but we wanted to have an open-ended dialog to assess it’s visibility at the CIO level. Almost every CIO in the room expressed concern about Shadow IT at their organization. It seemed like a problem many CIOs had thought about. Some of the major culprits cited werre medical residents. There wasn’t consensus, but one area that emerged is the need for a bimodal IT offering — one for traditional, or core IT, and one for Shadow IT.  One interesting sidebar of this discussion concerned what to do about Shadow IT. The consensus seemed to be that stopping it isn’t an option given increasing knowledge of the Shadow IT community and the lower cost and complexity of cloud development.  It was suggested that a credentialing process be created to establish education requirements, acceptable tools and usage, reporting, etc.  This idea would require a lot of development to be viable, but it has interesting implications.

    We gained a lot of value from the discussion and we hope the CIOs who participated felt it was a good use of their time.

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
