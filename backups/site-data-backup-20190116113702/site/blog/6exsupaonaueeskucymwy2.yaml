  :bio_short: As CEO, Travis leads Datica's vision. His background in compliance,
    security, and cloud infrastructure gives him technical expertise that, when paired
    with his experiences as an MD, allows for a unique view on the challenges of healthcare.
  :bio: "Before founding Datica, Travis explored a diverse background, starting with
    business and technology. After securing his MBA and MS, he analyzed security systems
    with PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton. Eventually Travis crossed
    into the clinical world, becoming an MD in 2011.\n\nIn 2016, Travis joined the
    HITRUST Alliance Business Associates Council as a founding member alongside such
    companies as Microsoft, Humana, United Health Group, Salesforce, and Epic.\n\nYou
    can find Travis presenting on the future of healthcare transformation at events
    throughout the year, or hosting podcast interviews with industry luminaries. He
    is an active writer with over 450 publications on HIStalk Mobile.\n\nIn 2015,
    Travis participated in a panel at SXSW discussing HIPAA, compliance, and innovation.
    In 2013, Travis participated in a panel discussion at the annual mHealth Summit
    with former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). The panel focused
    on government compliance. Earlier in the year, he presented a keynote titled \"Connected
    Health—The Coming Wave in Search of a Beach\" at the annual AHIMA conference,
    and led innovation sessions at the conference. Travis has also keynoted at past
    HIMSS and Health 2.0 conferences, as well as recent HITRUST Summits.\n\nAlong
    with HIStalk Mobile, Travis has contributed to VentureBeat and HITconsultant,

:summary: There are nearly 70,000 digital health apps available on your mobile device

  back up most of them? Would it deter you from downloading them knowing they were

:post: "Though as easy as it would be to disparage these developers, they are not
  necessarily the culprit. Upon recognizing multiple disparities in the creation,
  invention, and utilization of mobile health apps, a lack of clinical infrastructure
  can be discerned. And without a base research framework, developers cannot easily
  access patients and their data, leading to the notable lack of validation to potential
  disruptive solutions. \n\nWhat most developers fail to recognize though is that
  healthcare technology is different because it involves patients. This means a necessity
  to comply with human research stipulations, data confidentiality, security, and
  privacy sanctions exists. Even greater than market validation, proper healthcare
  business requires proven, repeatable results. \n\nHere are two reasons your app
  may be struggling with clinical validation:\n\n### 1. Understanding IRBs\n\nAn IRB,
  [institutional review board](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/irb/), is a council
  formed with the intent to approve, review, and monitor behavioral and biomedical
  human research. Responsibility for overseeing all research conducted on human subjects
  lies with this board. Without proper knowledge of IRBs and how they work, achieving
  clinical validation is going to a difficult venture.\n\n### 2. Cost of Clinical
  Trials\n\nClinical trials are expensive and the costs of these trials fall into
  two buckets: patient care and research. Patient care costs will include everything
  from laboratory tests to health insurance; whereas research costs are those conducive
  to conducting the trial. The main differentiator is who is responsible for these
  costs. Patient care costs usually are the responsibility of the patient who is most
  likely covered by a third-party health plan, but research costs are not the patient’s
  responsibility and will become the liability of the trial sponsor.\n\n"
