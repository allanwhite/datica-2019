:summary: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
  back to the states, you must address EU-U.S. Privacy Shield — an additional privacy
  requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice.
:blog_lead: If your U.S. company plans to bring health data from the European Union
  back to the states, you must address an additional privacy requirement laid out
  by the European Court of Justice. The [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome),
  which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies a stronger obligation
  on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either self-certify for the EU-U.S.
  Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment. This [self-certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Join-Privacy-Shield-part-1)
  or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy Shield Framework requirements
  that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
:post: "\nWhile everyone is gearing up for the General Data Protection Regulation
  (GDPR) that goes into effect for the European Union on May 25, 2018, one critical
  facet cannot be overlooked for customers who aspire to work internationally.\n\n##
  Q & A with Lori Meals\n\nDatica Director of Compliance Lori Meals has been gathering
  more details on the Privacy Shield and readying Datica for its own self-certification.
  She recently sat down to answer questions on the topic that will be helpful to you
  as you think through the necessary steps in bringing private health data back to
  the states from abroad.\n \n### Why are the privacy protections more stringent in
  the European Union than the U.S.?\n \nThe EU has been more progressive around data
  privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the fascist
  regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities. Therefore,
  Europeans are especially sensitive to this sort of personal data being shared.\n
  \n### Why was the Safe Harbour Framework invalidated and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
  enacted in its place?\n \nAll comes down to [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden).
  Remember him? He’s the former National Security Association (NSA) contractor who
  revealed that the intelligence agency had been spying on European citizen data held
  by American companies.  That snowball quickly rolled downhill to Facebook. Austrian
  student Max Schrems filed subsequent lawsuits, alleging that Facebook had not been
  protecting personal data of Europeans, as extrapolated from the Snowden leaks. Those
  leaks showed that the NSA performed surveillance on technology companies, like Facebook.
  His complaints landed in the European Court of Justice whose governance quickly
  invalidated the Safe Harbour Framework and exacted a seismic shift upon international
  data privacy.\n\n### Is the Privacy Shield certification required for Datica?\n
  \nNo, it is not incumbent upon us, but it is for our customers, assuming they are
  expanding into Europe and/or using European citizen data. Without the Privacy Shield,
  a U.S. company is potentially liable when not adhering to these principles.\n \n###
  What must a customer know about Privacy Shield?\n \nThe Privacy Shield has a couple
  of important vocabulary words: data controller and data processor. Datica would
  be the “data processor” because we only work on behalf of those who are collecting
  the data. The Privacy Shield lays out the data protection principles that gives
  an individual the right to know that a company not only holds your data, but that
  the individual can request that such data be deleted, updated or changed, as well
  as requesting copies of it.\n \n### Is there anything else that a Datica customer
  needs to know?\n \nBefore expanding into Europe, U.S. companies must sign a Data
  Processing Agreement (DPA). The DPA signifies the agreement the parties’ have made
  with respect to terms governing personal data processing. Organizations will also
  need to contract with a 3rd party to handle complaints about how the organization
  handles data, should any arise. \n\n### How does this impact digital health companies
  long-term?\n \nThe rules and regulations have become more stringent upon U.S. companies
  involved with cross border data transfers. Abiding by the European requirements
  is imperative for staying out of hot legal waters. \n\nDatica exists to help make
  digital health companies successful whether they work solely with U.S. citizen data
  or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters between countries. We live in a
  thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone follows the rules, we increase
  the chances of digital health success and decrease the chances of getting our hands
  and wallets slapped in court.\n\n"

  :summary: A recent NIST update includes important changes that encourage out of
    band authentication methods versus a single source email. Learn how Datica is
    responding.
  :blog_lead: Cybersecurity risk management has quickly moved from the “nagging mosquito”
    kind of problem that every industry must swat to one more likened to a full frontal
    attack, requiring more arsenal than budgets sometimes allow. Everywhere, from
    White House hacks into communication emails to security breaches, like the recent
    one announced by Equifax that has affected 145.5 million Americans, leave cybercriminals
    more in touch with our private financial and healthcare data than perhaps we are
    ourselves.
  :post: "All of these attacks have cybersecurity professionals searching every nook
    and cranny for ways to more easily understand, manage and mitigate risks to their
    organizations. Those security exposures abound everywhere and no organization
    is immune to the problem. One governmental organization actively addressing the
    widespread issue is the U.S. Department of Commerce’s  [National Institute of
    Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) (NIST).\n \nA recent NIST update,
    specifically [revision 3 of 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html),
    includes important changes that encourage (out of band authentication methods
    versus a single source email. [Out of band authentication](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/out-of-band-authentication)
    is more commonly used by financial institutions that often require two separate
    and unconnected authentication channels for access. This type of two-factor authentication
    makes hacking an account more difficult.\n\n## Authentication versus identity
    proofing\n \nThe recent NIST update includes a further clarification that separates
    out identity authentication from identity proofing. “Identity authentication and
    authentication proofing complement each other to definitively prove that you have
    the proper credentials to access a file, server, or other data containing device
    or software,” explained Datica’s Director of Compliance Lori Meals. “The whole
    question is: How do we prove John is really John in any instance?”\n \nThis nuance
    is important to Datica customers who live and breathe in an environment awash
    with protected health information. More and more the healthcare industry is affected
    by [security breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/facing-down-the-largest-breaches-of-2017-with-daticas-open-source-policies/)
    that have deep financial impacts to providers, as well as financial and emotional
    ramifications to patients. Meals explains that “Healthcare data fetches a high
    price on the black market, so that makes it a lucrative target for bad actors.”\n
    \nThis clarification for authentication proofing affects our customers because
    that will change their controls. When an email has been compromised within an
    organization, a hacker potentially has easy access to all other aspects of the
    victim’s accounts.\n \n## How Datica compliance efforts will adapt and respond\n
    \nThe engineering team is busy prepping a new feature to the [Datica Platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/)
    so that an organization can change its multi-factor authentication options to
    disallow email as an authentication method. \n \nNo organization is immune to
    the problem of [hacking or phishing](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/spear-phishing-hackers-aiming-for-healthcare/);
    risks proliferate everywhere. However, as a trusted partner for the protected
    health information of our customers, Datica takes a “no stone left unturned” approach
    to helping customers prevent the all too common publicity crisis and organizational
    chaos that occurs when hackers break through organizational walls. That’s why
    Datica developed its [HIPAA compliant](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    platform initially and was one of the first healthcare IT organizations to become
    HITRUST CSF Certified. Security and compliance is in our DNA. \n\nIs security
    and compliance a top concern and priority for your organization? Contact Datica
    at hello@datica.com to arrange a quick chat about your needs and to learn more
    about how the Datica Platform can take that burden off your shoulders."

    At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

    Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

    ## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

    With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

    ![diagram - platform-hitrust-inheritance](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/fE9OrSoh0sa04GGIeUA6y/1ec20a7821aaf7c388f891786139e088/platform-hitrust-inheritance.png)

    Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

    This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.

  :summary: In the 377 healthcare data breaches last year, phishing attacks were among
    the top data breach causes. Why is healthcare such a target for spear phishing
    attacks?
  :blog_lead: "At the beginning of August, the BBC reported that a UK-based “prankster”
    had successfully [spoofed the White House.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40788080)
    Through spear phishing emails, this bad actor had not only convinced a senior
    cyber security officer that he was the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor
    Jared Kushner, but also veiled himself as the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus
    to fool then White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci into inflammatory
    email exchanges. After posting a few of those emails on Twitter, the culprit promised
    not to do it again and urged the current administration to “tighten up IT policy.”
    While the jokester later indicated his email spoofing had no harmful intent, the
    implications go way beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n"
  :post: "Phishing is a widely used form of social engineering where malicious ne’re-do-wells
    broadcast  disguised emails to a large population in an attempt to steal sensitive
    information like usernames, passwords, financial and yes, healthcare data. Although
    not commonly known until 2005, phishing scams first appeared around 1995, with
    the term first being coined in a Usenet group on January 2, 1996. When America
    Online (AOL) reigned as king of email communication, scammers regularly masked
    themselves as banking sites and financial institutions, as well as PayPal and
    Ebay. These fraudulent emails would often persuade victims to open a link with
    a malevolent attachment or visit a malicious web site. \n\nLater, these phishing
    scams bred a more targeted type of phishing called [“spear phishing.”](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)
    For this type of hoax, cyber shysters use targeted emails designed to appear as
    if from someone the victim knows, such as a colleague, business manager or even
    someone from the human resources department. These tailored emails often contain
    subject lines or content that capitalize on the victim’s known interests. \n\n##
    Is Healthcare a Spear Phishing Target?\n\nIn the 377 healthcare data breaches
    last year, the [Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and CyberScout](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-breaches-increase-40-percent-in-2016-finds-new-report-from-identity-theft-resource-center-and-cyberscout-300393208.html)
    report shows phishing attacks were among the top data breach causes. Along with
    hacking and skimming, these three scams made up 55.5 percent of the breaches.
    Furthermore, spear phishing appears to be the most likely type of scam targeting
    CEOs. From 2015 to 2016, the numbers for these methods of breaches rose 17.7 percent.
    In the first part of 2017, phishing has been used to gain access to UC Davis Health,
    Torrance Memorial Medical and Washington University School of Medicine, according
    to Healthcare IT News piece titled [“The biggest healthcare breaches of 2017 (so
    far).”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/slideshow/biggest-healthcare-breaches-2017-so-far?page=32)
    This upward trend isn’t about to subside until an even more lucrative scam arises.
    With an average cost of a healthcare data breach at about $380 per record, mitigating
    spear phishing remains top of mind for Datica and its customers.\n\n## Spear Phishing
    Recommendations\n\nFor insight into this latest trend, I reached out to Datica
    Security Engineer Brandon Maxwell. He shared the reason for an increase in spear
    phishing: high success rates — which make it the number one delivery vehicle for
    ransomware and malware. “They don’t need complex methods of breaking through security
    walls when they can simply trick someone inside an organization to hand over what
    they want,” says Maxwell. \n\nDatica, like every other healthcare IT organization,
    is also vulnerable to this type of encounter. For example, one spear phishing
    attempt that we recently blocked came from an imposter who cleverly spoofed one
    of our executive’s email addresses. He or she used that email address to request
    a wire transfer from the finance department. Trained to spot such deceit, the
    department head alerted the appropriate person within Datica about the email and
    its request, and ultimately averted the scam. Datica now uses this spoof example
    to warn its own customers to such trickery. \n\nDatica’s Director of Compliance
    Lori Meals touts four ways healthcare organizations can better protect themselves
    from such attacks. Her recommendations and thoughts, along with Maxwell’s include:\n\n###
    Awareness, training and testing\n\nAll employees need to be made aware of what
    phishing is and the damage that can result from a successful attack. Maxwell outlines
    the steps he uses to fully inform Datica employees, “Sharing what a spear phishing
    email looks like, explaining how to evaluate such an email and then confirming
    that employees know to whom suspicious emails should be forwarded for evaluation
    are a strategic way to thwart outside intrusions that could breach an organization’s
    thickest walls.” Meals strongly encourages periodic testing of employees’ knowledge
    and awareness of fake phishing emails by crafting internal spear phishing lures
    that can be distributed internally. However, she cautions against doing testing
    at specific dates. “You don’t want to make testing so regular that on October
    1st, every employee expects a fake spear phishing email,” says Meals. \n\n###
    Putting technical measures in place\n\nCertain technical steps must be in place
    as the first line of defense against all phishing scams. “When someone is trying
    to fake an email and send it to someone in your organization, you should have
    the technical measures in place that will flag that email as suspicious,” says
    Maxwell.\n\n### Measurement and management\n\nSetting and tracking goals, then
    managing any steps for failure is a critical part of any good compliance program
    “Having zero percent of employees click on that test should be the organizational
    goal,” says Meals. “Anything less than a zero level goal would require remediation
    steps.” \n\nThese compliance concepts run parallel with the concepts found in
    HITRUST. Datica joins an elite group of healthcare vendors in the United States
    to achieve [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/platform/compliance/)
    status and believes that this gold-standard for security of healthcare data is
    the best way to protect its customers. \n\n## Datica’s Customer Protections\n\nSecurity
    and compliance are deeply woven into [Datica’s company culture](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/).
    If you’ve ever had to let one of your employees go who had access to your environment
    on the Datica platform, you have encountered Datica’s billing-based method of
    double verification. The Datica engineering team works hand in hand with the billing
    department to quickly verify and make customer requested adjustments for access.
    Datica utilizes stringent measures for Identity proofing to protect its customers.
    These steps combined with the recommendations above better protect your organization
    for a spear phishing attack. \n"

    data breach notifications, and much more. '

  :lead: "## What is the GDPR?\nGDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation,
    is the acronym for the much anticipated new European Union (EU) security and privacy
    framework that goes into effect on May 25th, 2018. GDPR leaves some discretion
    to EU member states but, as a general rule—and the reason it is getting so much
    attention—it applies across all EU Member States. It applies to all personal,
    individually identifiable data storage of EU citizens’ data which extends its
    coverage to healthcare providers, payors, life sciences, and digital health companies
    located anywhere. \n"
  :body: "\n### Why does the GDPR exist?\n\nThe EU has been more progressive around
    data privacy, and that’s especially true for Germany. During World War II, the
    fascist regime used personal information to target people for all sorts of atrocities.
    Therefore, Europeans are especially sensitive to personal data being shared. The
    issue of data privacy and leaks has become more urgent in recent years after it
    came to light that the U.S. National Security Association (NSA) was spying on
    European citizen data, starting a snowball effect that also involved issues of
    data privacy on Facebook and exacted a seismic shift upon international data privacy
    regulations.\n\n### Why care about GDPR Data Security?\n\nIf you do anything with
    EU citizen healthcare data, then you are at risk of significant penalties for
    violations. The penalties for violating GDPR can be up to $20m or 4% global revenue,
    whichever is highest. That’s enough to put most healthcare vendors out of business.
    If you want to work in the EU, are already in the EU, or even if you could potentially
    collect EU citizen health data, you need to expand your compliance program and
    posture to minimize your risk.\n\n### How does GDPR compare to HIPAA?\n\nHealthcare
    and health data, “data concerning health”, is one subset of GDPR and specifically
    applies to data concerning physical and mental health, genetic data, and biometric
    data. The good news is that GDPR has considerable overlap with HIPAA, and to an
    even larger extent, HITRUST. Fundamentally, addressing HIPAA and GDPR is about
    having security as a core tenet of operations; the major difference is ensuring
    that evidence and documentation is created to prove compliance with each framework.\n\nGet
    a general overview of [how GDPR compares to HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-does-gdpr-compare-to-hipaa/)
    including why GDPR is getting such outsized attention, the definition of GDPR,
    how to report breaches, the guidelines for health data access, and the required
    Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on the Datica blog.\n\n## Does the
    GDPR apply to cloud service providers?\n\nTo understand whether the GDPR applies
    to your cloud service business, you need to first understand the different definitions
    of “Controller” and “Processor” and the relationship between the two. Using HIPAA
    as an analogy to explain: a Controller is like a Covered Entity, a Processor is
    like a Business Associate, and a Sub-processor is like a Subcontractor.\n\nIf
    you are reading this, within the GDPR, you are most likely a Processor of some
    sort. Welcome to the club! This is what Datica is as well because any piece of
    health IT technology that handles identifiable EU citizen data in a cloud-based
    modality can be considered a “cloud service provider” which means a Processor.
    \n\nUnderstand the obligations Processors (and cloud service providers) have within
    GDPR, risk allocation between business partners, the GDPR definition of data protection
    by design and default, and the role of HITRUST in GDPR compliance by reading the
    academy article, [GDPR for Cloud Service Providers.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-for-cloud-service-providers/)\n\n##
    What is a GDPR data breach?\n\nWe get asked all the time for the meaning of a
    data breach. It often comes up when people look at a breach vs. a security incident.
    It gets even muddier when the term “security incident involving ePHI” is brought
    into the mix. While seemingly nitpicky, understanding the differences between
    these terms is essential to reduce your risk and to inform your partners and customers.
    Ambiguity and opacity is a not a good strategy when it comes to compliance and
    foundational definitions.\n\nLearn about what counts as a security incident under
    GDPR, and how GDPR data breach compares to HIPAA data breach in the Datica Academy
    article, [What is a Data Breach under GDPR and HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/what-is-data-breach-gdpr-and-hipaa/)\n\n###
    Are there really only 72 hours for breach notification?\n\nOne of the most challenging
    aspects of any security and compliance program is data breach notification. “Beach
    notification” is actually multiple tasks — surveillance, investigation, and ultimately
    notification (to end users, partners, and sometimes media). It is time-consuming,
    expensive, and, when handled poorly, embarrassing for organizations and can lead
    to more investigations.\n\nThe 72-hour security breach requirement written into
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 33 is rightfully generating
    a lot of attention and angst. 72 hours is not enough time to do all of the things
    that organizations are used to doing ahead of notifying authorities and individuals
    about a breach.\n\nGDPR breach reporting is more prescriptive and more aggressive
    than the requirements under HIPAA, or likely any other compliance framework. Learn
    the ins and outs of [GDPR data breach requirements](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-requirements/)
    in the Datica Academy.\n\n### What’s the checklist for a breach notification process?\n\nThe
    breach notification requirements outlined in GDPR Article 33 are aggressive —“The
    controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours
    after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
    authority.” \n\nAt Datica, we’ve built and tested our breach notification process
    to meet the most stringent notification requirements of covered entities. At times,
    we’ve had to adjust our compliance program. The following steps are the ones we
    went through when we updated our breach reporting. All of these actions should
    be orchestrated by your data protection officer, the person at your organization
    who is ultimately responsible for your compliance with GDPR.\n\n1. Define and
    get consensus on what you mean by “breach”\n2. Document your current process\n*
    Identify major buckets of work\n* Rank the criticality of each bucket of work\n*
    Rank each bucket of work by the about of time it takes to complete\n* Identify
    key personnel\n* Identify critical steps that must be completed before notifying
    authorities\n3. Develop the new process that can be completed in 72 hours\n* Create
    templates/ efficiencies\n* Test your new process (and document it)\n4. Notify
    customers and partners of your new breach reporting process\n\nThe academy post,
    [GDPR Data Breach Notification Checklist](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-data-breach-notification-checklist/)
    walks through the details of each step listed above you should take to bring your
    breach reporting policies and procedures in compliance with GDPR.\n\n## How much
    are the GDPR Fines and Penalties?\n\nArticle 58 of the GDPR grants supervisory
    authority the ability to not only to investigate controllers and processors but
    also to impose fines. The administrative penalties are defined in GDPR Article
    83. The fines are in addition to other actions, such as audits and corrective
    actions, outlined in Article 58.\n\nThe specific GDPR penalty language, and the
    bulk of the discussion and interest in the Regulation, is in Article 83. There
    are two specific fines listed in Article 83 - 1) 10,000,000 EUR, or 2% of total
    worldwide turnover (revenue) and 2) 20,000,000 EUR, or 4% of total worldwide turnover
    (revenue). \n\nFor a detailed understanding of the reasons for each of the different
    fine levels, advice on how to minimize your risk of GDPR fines, and a description
    of Article 84 member States’ penalties, read the Datica academy entry, [GDPR Fines
    and Penalties.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/gdpr-fines-and-penalties/)\n\n## What
    if you transfer data outside of the EU? \n\nWhile you are gearing up for the GDPR,
    one critical facet cannot be overlooked for healthcare enterprises and digital
    health companies who aspire to work internationally. If your U.S. company plans
    to bring health data from the EU back to the United States, you must address an
    additional privacy requirement laid out by the European Court of Justice. \n\nThe
    EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which replaced the previous Safe Harbour Framework, levies
    a stronger obligation on U.S. companies today. To comply, companies must either
    self-certify for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or obtain a third-party assessment.
    This self-certification or assessment confirms that your company meets the Privacy
    Shield Framework requirements that help protect the personal data of Europeans.
    \n\nThe Datica blog has more information on Privacy Shield so you can [know the
    ropes before pulling data back across the pond.](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/privacy-shield-know-the-ropes-before-pulling-data-back-across-the-pond/)\n\n##
    Is Datica GDPR Compliant?\n\nDatica's compliance program is comprehensive. The
    process of expanding and proving compliance across multiple frameworks, both for
    us and our customers, is not new to us at Datica. You can follow our changes through
    the updates to our open source policies and procedures; our policies define the
    operational and technical controls we use. We started with HIPAA and quickly expanded
    to leverage HITRUST as the core risk framework for our internal compliance program.
    \n\nWe then added SOC2, Privacy Shield, and, most recently, GxP. We plant to complete
    our full GDPR audit by May 25, 2018, when GDPR goes into effect. Our goal has
    always been to build and maintain one compliance program to prove compliance with
    multiple frameworks. In the paraphrased words of HITRUST: one control, many frameworks.\n\nDatica
    exists to help makers of digital health products be successful whether they work
    solely with U.S. citizen data or if they dip a toe into the commercial waters
    between countries. We live in a thriving, global digital economy today. When everyone
    follows the rules, we increase the chances of digital health success and decrease
    the chances of getting our hands and wallets slapped in court.\n\nWith Datica,
    you'll be ready when GDPR takes effect in May, 2018. [Talk to one of our compliance
    experts](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/contact/) today to find out how you can be compliant
