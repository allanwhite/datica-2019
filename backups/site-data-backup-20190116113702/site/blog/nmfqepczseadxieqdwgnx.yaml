:summary: For the cloud buyer and the enterprise that just wants to get onto the cloud,
  2019 will only see more optionality, point solutions, and ultimately noise.
:blog_lead: I feel sorry for cloud buyers in 2019. Whether at AWS re:Invent last Fall
  or just on the Internet searching for answers and solutions on the cloud, the amount
  of noise in the market is incredibly high right now. Filtering that noise down to
  meaningful signal is nearly impossible, a challenge made harder as many cloud buyers
  are still fuzzy about their enterprise cloud strategies.
:post: |2+

  > One thing I can't stand is the noise, noise, noise, noise! - Grinch

  The reasons for the issue of noise is multifaceted. On the one hand, the cloud service providers (CSPs) — AWS, Microsoft, and Google — are redefining the cloud every month with new managed services. AWS crossed one thousand managed services in 2018. And the cloud providers are pushing the market to adopt these managed services, driving the conversation. In many respects, the power of the cloud lies in the ability to offload the running (setup and maintenance) of software by enterprises to dedicated CSPs. CSPs run software for customers as managed services.

  On the other hand, there’s a gold rush to develop offerings on top of CSPs. Everybody from Capital One to Deloitte to countless startups were at [AWS re:Invent](https://datica.com/blog/aws-re-invent-re-actions-controlling-risk-is-important-but-confusing/) in December with products and services on top of your cloud accounts. You can buy everything from a team to set up and manage your entire cloud account to a single pane of glass into the cost of your cloud workloads to a widget to automate simple, repetitive tasks on the cloud. It’s overwhelming.

  The [job-to-be-done (JTBD)](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/12/the-jobs-to-be-done-theory-of-innovation) for cloud buyers is dependent on the maturity of the organization in developing and executing a cloud strategy. Ultimately, the JTBD of the organization to which the individual cloud buyer works is to get onto the cloud. In getting an organization onto the cloud, they realize the benefits of offloading the management of infrastructure, convert the bulk of IT spend from capital expenditures (Capex) to operating expenditures (Opex), and, ideally, improve or at least maintain consistent [security and privacy posture](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance/). The last point is increasingly important as organizations need to avoid exposing themselves to the increased risk associated with data breach or loss by moving to the cloud.

  The CSP is the platform. It’s a platform with literally thousands upon thousands of configuration and architecture choices in the form of mixing and matching various managed services. Couple that with the myriad of third-party products and services in and around the CSPs and the options grow even more.

  Sadly, for the cloud buyer and the enterprise that just wants to get onto the cloud, 2019 will only see more optionality, point solutions, and ultimately noise.  While the end state of the cloud as a large part of the IT infrastructure for every organization in the world is firmly established, the path to get to that end state is going to be full of fits and starts as entities try to filter the noise of the cloud into something that delivers value.

  At this stage and in this light, the CSPs are ultimately the only clear winners, and they are going to be very, very big winners when the cloud eventually tips. The distribution of winnings is still TBD, but [AWS has continued to be the dominant player](https://siliconangle.com/2018/11/19/no-surprise-amazon-continues-dominate-public-cloud-market/).

  That leaves a few thousand other cloud solutions providers competing to solve specific challenges on the cloud, trying to differentiate themselves in an extremely crowded market. The market is large, and the winners are still being determined so we will continue to see massive investments both in new ventures as well as in spinouts of large enterprises.

    trends for 2018 I predict we’ll see as the government, individuals, and private
    sector demand change this year. The first of those trends is an increase in cash-pay
    practices. Whether you call it cash pay, subscription medicine, direct primary
    care, or concierge medicine, the underlying commonality is cutting out the payors.

    __6 Healthcare Trends to Watch in 2018.__  It’s 2018, and the world looks much
    different than it did a year ago. Go back even further and the differences are
    even more stark. No place is that more evident than in healthcare. As the largest
    industry in the world, healthcare has weathered the most significant political
    waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare increased unchecked,

    __2018 Healthcare Trends Part 3: 6 Predictions for the Post-EHR World.__  Sadly,
    the biggest winners in our post-health reform world (post-HITECH and ACA) are
    neither patients nor providers; the big winners are electronic health record (EHR)
    companies and the cottage industry of consultants and services who support them.
    This isn’t an indictment of EHRs, though I don’t think EHRs have delivered on
    the promise of the triple aim. It’s merely a sad observation of the outcome of
    billions of dollars spent to improve healthcare. Regardless, we are here in 2018,
    and EHRs play a central role in the daily lives of providers and, by extension,
    patients. This third part of our 2018 Healthcare Trends series offers predictions

    __2018 Healthcare Trends Part 5: The Real Cloud Comes to Healthcare.__ Information
    technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a colossal chunk of their
    time supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors,
    health system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to
    EHRs, hospital IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies,
    that require care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications
    and you quickly see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog. [_continue reading_](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n7.

  :summary: Government, individuals, and private sector will continue a push for change
    in 2018. Dr. Travis Good predicts 6 major healthcare trends for the new year.
  :blog_lead: It’s 2018, and the world looks much different [than it did a year ago](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
    Go [back even further](https://datica.com/blog/5-predictions-for-digital-health-in-2016/)
    and the differences are even more stark. No place is that more evident than in
    healthcare. As the largest industry in the world, healthcare has  weathered the
    most significant political waves of the last fifteen years. As the costs of healthcare
    increased unchecked, politicians took notice.
  :post: "\nIn our pseudo free-market health system, where a considerable portion
    of costs are covered with public funds, and where the largest public payor initiates
    changes that are then emulated by commercial payors and, likewise, where government
    entities heavily regulate healthcare’s techniques and technologies, politicians
    have intervened to force changes. With healthcare being a major topic of the last
    several elections and a top priority for President Obama during one of his two
    terms (as it was for President Clinton, though his primary initiatives in healthcare
    didn’t pass), it’s no surprise that the current administration also would like
    to impart change. [President Trump is now working to alter](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-two-trump-and-putting-the-genie-back-in-the-bottle/)
    some of what the Obama administration put into place. This move creates more uncertainty
    and requires change. I think everyone agrees on a defined set of goals for the
    industry, known as the triple aim (better outcomes, lower costs, improved experience),
    but the path to achieving those goals is wildly variable depending on your political
    position.\n\nUnfortunately these required changes have placed the industry in
    turmoil. In an effort to modernize its technology, EHRs have been forced between
    providers and patients to ensure better, more consistent data collection. Ideally,
    this move should reduce medical errors and redundant tests, however, the government
    missed a massive opportunity here when it spent north of $40B on incentives to
    increase digitization of medical records — EHR software that wasn’t built to reduce
    medical errors, unnecessary tests or even improve clinician communication or data
    sharing across providers that would ensure continuity of care. At the same time,
    government financial incentives prompted a change to healthcare services to ensure
    quality. Yet, most of these quality initiatives didn’t go far enough and consequently
    increased data reporting burdens for clinicians. Meanwhile, payments for the majority
    of healthcare services have been reduced, squeezing provider margins and changing
    the rules for how providers are paid.\n \nHealthcare hasn’t improved for consumers.
    During appointments, providers struggle to connect because they have screens,
    not patients, in front of them. Insurance coverage has gotten worse; choices have
    been reduced and the complexity of bills and payor communications to consumers
    more complex. How much worse have things become? I have an MD, MBA, and MS. I
    run a healthcare company with ~50 employees and have been writing and speaking
    on healthcare and healthcare technology for ten years. My wife and many of my
    friends are practicing physicians; some are my physicians. Yet, I woefully struggle
    to understand my medical bills, choices in providers, and generally how to navigate
    our broken system. \n\nWhere does that leave healthcare going into 2018? I’d argue
    that healthcare, if anything, is worse today than it was a year ago. The government,
    individuals, and private sector will certainly continue pushing for more changes
    in 2018. Given that, I predict we’ll see a few major healthcare trends as we move
    through the new year.\n\n## Subscription / direct pay / cash-based practices \n\nConsumers,
    with minimal choice in healthcare, find it difficult to speak with their wallets
    or their feet. Similarly, providers have even fewer options. It's no wonder that
    subscription medicine and cash-based medical practices are growing in popularity
    for both providers and patients (more on that below). These care models align
    incentives and are transparent. Geared towards those who have the ability to pay
    extra for better services, today, the majority of these care models bank on the
    pocketbooks of the middle to upper class. However, [emerging data sets](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/direct-primary-care-innovative-alternative-conventional-health-insurance)
    show the success of this model is also possible for underserved populations, as
    well. Learn more about what I think will happen with [cash-pay practices in 2018](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-cash-pay-practices-will-grow/).\n
    \ \n## Post-EHR healthcare \n\nThe gravy train of meaningful use (MU) is over.
    The effect of MU was a significant, artificial, driver of adoption for a few EHRs.
    Today, digital health records are the standard. As we move through 2018, keep
    an eye on EHRs and how they justify their ROI once massive capital expenditures
    are written down. Likewise, you’ll want to consider how clinicians adjust to this
    brave new world. Read more about my [2018 predictions for the post-EHR world](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\n##
    Clinicians as developers\n\nThe EHR wave of health IT left out clinicians. EHR
    and IT vendors drove those early technology decisions. Now, with software eating
    the world, clinicians are acting like software developers and corporate innovators
    in helping to design and, in some cases, build new technology and technology-enabled
    services for their colleagues and their patients. [Read more of my thoughts on
    clinicians as developers.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-part-4-clinicians-as-developers/)\n\n##
    The real cloud\n\n[HIMSS 2018](http://www.himssconference.org/), the largest health
    technology conference on the planet, will for the first time see the behemoth
    booths of EHR vendors challenged by the equally massive booths of public cloud
    service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. This is the canary in the
    coalmine moment for healthcare, not just for the adoption of the real cloud over
    simple virtualization, but also in the fragmentation of infrastructure and services
    managed by third parties for healthcare delivery organizations. [Learn more about
    the real cloud in healthcare.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-pt-5-real-cloud-comes-to-healthcare/)\n\n##
    Beyond digital health hype\n\nDigital health has been hyped for a long time as
    a savior for healthcare. Unfortunately, healthcare is not that simple and no savior
    exists to untangle us from our current mess of a system. Technology, for technology’s
    sake, is not going to fix healthcare. While we’ve witnessed incredible enthusiasm
    around new technologies disrupting healthcare, we’re also now seeing some public
    failures, like the recent [acquisition/fire sale of Practice Fusion](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/allscripts-buys-practice-fusion-100-million),
    or the [Castlight Health initial public offering hype](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/03/14/castlight-health-ipo/6411725/)
    and valuation assumptions compared to the market reality of today. Similar to
    EHRs, digital health now must prove it’s worth if it’s going to have sticking
    power. [Find out more about getting beyond the digital hype.](https://datica.com/blog/2018-healthcare-trends-6-beyond-digital-health-hype/)\n\n##
    Blockchain to the rescue \n\nSpeaking of hype, [blockchain has made its way into
    healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/11/29/this-is-why-blockchains-will-transform-healthcare/#2560e48f1ebe).
    Smart contracts, immutability, and a clear audit trail — hallmarks of blockchain
    technology — hold much promise for healthcare data and exchange. The problem is
    that technology, especially when it comes to data sharing and interoperability
    in healthcare, is not the dominant roadblock. Layering in new technology, like
    blockchain, leaves the fundamental organizational and political problems unsolved.\n\nI’ll
    focus on each of these trends in subsequent posts, distilling all of these healthcare
    trends down into one larger narrative: post-EHR healthcare is finally ready and
    incented to start making the necessary changes that will align with the triple
    aim. Massive organizations will vie for their place in this new healthcare world;
    some will win and others won’t. The winners will be the providers AND the patients.\n"

  :summary: Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing
    the male-dominated technology landscape. Just last week in Stockholm, the Women
    in Tech 2018 conference sold out completely in just two minutes after tickets
    went on sale.
  :blog_lead: "Women and men all over the world are rising to the challenge of changing
    the male-dominated technology landscape. Just last week in Stockholm, the [Women
    in Tech 2018](https://www.womenintech.se/) conference sold out completely in just
    two minutes after tickets went on sale. It seems that you can’t read today’s news
    without finding another story about women speaking out about gender injustices.
    Though women have made major strides forward on issues around equality, gender
    diversity in the workplace — especially at the top — remains an unattained goal.
    \n\n\n"
  :post: "\nWomen start out their careers just behind men in terms of everything from
    position to salary. As the chart below shows, that gap begins to widen as they’re
    up for their first promotion to manager, giving men an early head start in the
    race to leadership positions. They’re also less likely to be hired directly into
    leadership positions or to start their own businesses. \n\nAlmost nowhere is this
    trend more prevalent than in the technology, and particularly cloud, industry.
    As a woman who began a very slow crawl up the corporate ladder at technology companies
    nearly thirty years ago, and who often finds herself as the only female leader
    around a table of men, I can personally attest to the absence of women in technology
    and leadership roles.\n\nStartups fail at the [alarming rate of 90%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#190f14636679)
    and most of them are coincidentally led by males. In fact, last year in the United
    States only 20% of businesses were owned by women, and women accounted for just
    16% of executives. \n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6NN0Vp7GlUmqgm4EgAkGyC/f05ae0ef8fbbc8ce3718b1241bd5da51/Screen_Shot_2018-01-31_at_3.14.46_PM.png\"
    alt=\"Gender representation in corporate pipeline 2016\">\n*Source: Women in the
    Workplace 2016 study by leanin.org and McKinsey & Company*\n\nThe funding statistics
    are even more alarming with less than 3% of VC funding going to female founders.
    Translating that into dollars, $58.2B in venture capital funds went to all-male
    founders and only $1.46B to female founders. At the same time, [many studies](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)
    show that better business results are tied to greater diversity in the workplace
    and on the leadership team.\n\n> Women-led businesses outperform comparable businesses
    led by male counterparts,” Jacqueline Touma, Founder/CEO Curious Enterprises\n\nThese
    statistics and facts are alarming yet many companies and individuals are joining
    the effort to alter the male-dominated leadership dynamic at play. Companies’
    commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, and new opportunities are
    emerging regularly to cultivate more females in STEM fields, leadership roles,
    and as company founders.\n\n## Women in Cloud Seattle\n\nOne of those notable
    new efforts was the inaugural [Women in Cloud](http://www.womenincloud.com/) summit
    in Seattle, led by the Ignite WA leadership team in collaboration with industry
    partners, Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Meylah.
    On a typical rainy Seattle January day, I had the pleasure of joining more than
    350 technology leaders, predominantly women, at Microsoft’s Redmond campus for
    the event. We came together to celebrate the few female entrepreneurs in the tech
    world, discuss the issues that prevent women from becoming leaders and company
    founders, and to commit to offer a way forward through mentorship, community access,
    and funding.\n\n> You cannot have a strong business if you do not have diverse
    perspective. This room has to go make that change,” Gretchen O’Hara, Vice President
    US OCP Microsoft\n \nA great lineup of speakers from the Washington technology
    and VC community spoke on topics ranging from the language of inclusion and the
    journey of women in tech, to accelerating women entrepreneurship in the cloud.
    Entrepreneurship was a common theme with two big announcements of projects to
    help female-funded startups.\n\n## Women in Cloud Accelerator Program\n\nGavriella
    Schuster, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft shared information about a new
    initiative to help highly-motivated women who are founders of business-to-business
    cloud or technology companies. [The Cloud Accelerator Lab](http://www.womenincloud.com/about/accelerator/)
    is an immersive 6-month program for female founders to start and build their businesses
    with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft distribution channels. Twenty
    to thirty selected participants team together and live together in Seattle to
    receive access to resources, mentorship, and funding to build their cloud businesses.\n\n>
    My daughter's outlook on the barriers in front of her is so different than mine
    were at her age—let’s make sure that keeps happening,\" Gavriella Schuster, Corporate
    Vice President at Microsoft\n\n## Sybilla Masters Fund\n\nAnother highlight of
    the Women in Cloud summit was the announcement of the new Sybilla Masters Fund
    by Gillian Muessig, Co-Founder of MOZ and now CEO of [Outlines Venture Group](http://outlinesventure.com/).
    Sybilla Masters won a patent for her corn mill invention in 1720, becoming the
    first woman in the United States to receive a patent. It was awarded in her husband's
    name because a woman wasn't technically eligible, though he fought to make it
    known that Sybilla was the inventor. The new fund, named after Colonial America’s
    first female inventor, will officially launch when it reaches $2 million with
    an ultimate goal of raising $100 million. \n\nIn Muessig’s own words as published
    in [an interview with GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/moz-co-founder-gillian-muessig-unveils-new-venture-fund-back-women-led-startups/):\n\n>
    The object of the game here is to provide a fund that does gender-lensed investing,
    and that does not mean investing only in females or female founders. It really
    means looking at a company with the idea that says: How does this affect all genders,
    and in what way does it further the idea that all genders working together create
    a better outcome?”\n\nMicrosoft veteran, Alka Badshah and Outlines Venture Group
    President Anne Kennedy are founding investors in the Sybilla Masters Fund and
    will also serve as advisors to Muessig, who is the general partner and manages
    the fund’s investments. \n \n\nWith this renewed effort and enthusiasm, I am hopeful
    we'll finally see the trends reverse in the near future. And, as the statistics
    prove, women-owned businesses perform better so we may also see the startup failure
    rate decline as more female founders are funded and set up for success. \n\nHelping
    startups get from napkin scribble to market adoption with fewer surprises has
    always been part of the core of Datica’s DNA. We’re excited to share the news
    about these new initiatives with our own community of healthcare technology innovators
    in the hopes of seeing more female-led digital health businesses make it to market.

  :summary: 'The “real cloud” in healthcare is not virtualization. We are talking
    about the public cloud and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. '
  :blog_lead: |-
    Information technology groups at healthcare organizations spend a [colossal chunk](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/electronic-health-records-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html) of their time supporting and “optimizing” EHRs. And, with many of the largest EHR vendors, health system IT does it in-house using their own data centers. In addition to EHRs, hospital IT also has hundreds of smaller, often less essential technologies, that require care and feeding. Couple that with the needs to integrate applications and you quickly see why healthcare IT has such a huge backlog.

    At the same time, a significant strategic priority for healthcare organizations is assessing the cloud, developing a cloud strategy, and implementing that strategy. Most organizations are at some stage in this process. Many are still pre-implementation of a cloud strategy. But, it’s coming. And the health IT backlog is not conducive to the massive amount of work required to start moving technology to the cloud.
  :post: "\nWhat I mean by the cloud or the “real cloud” in my initial [2018 Healthcare
    Trends post](https://datica.com/blog/6-healthcare-trends-to-watch-in-2018/), is
    not virtualization. What I mean is the [public cloud](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
    and the public cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The public cloud
    is not Epic hosting in Verona, with a data center that is managed and operated
    by Epic, or Cerner hosting in Kansas City, with a data center that is managed
    and operated by Cerner; those are private clouds dedicated to a specific application
    and purpose. The public cloud is different.\n\nThe public cloud is a powerful
    public utility and a force that will transform healthcare, not just healthcare
    IT. It is almost infinitely scalable with a growing laundry list of services and
    features that can be activated and accessed on demand. And, with new security
    features, it is now finally ready for prime time, meaning only that it is ready
    for healthcare organizations to develop and implement cloud strategies. The public
    cloud will enable many things for healthcare organizations.\n\n## The public cloud
    will:\n\n1. Get healthcare organizations out of the data center and infrastructure
    business, allowing focus on providing care, better services, and better products
    (meds and devices)\n2. Massively improve disaster recovery, aiding in meeting
    compliance requirements\n3. Accelerate innovation, enabling faster response and
    adaptation to market changes\n4. Improve and ease access to health data both for
    providers and patients\n5. Enhance visibility into security and compliance\n6.
    Enable new partnerships and integrations.\n\nDespite the scale and challenges
    of moving to the cloud, the cloud is coming to healthcare, and it’s coming faster
    than most people think. Look no further than HIMSS 2018 and the newly enlarged
    presence of major cloud providers Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. Healthcare on the cloud is strategic for every cloud
    provider. The challenge for these three behemoths is being in healthcare at the
    right time. These cloud providers are at HIMSS in 2018 because now is the right
    time, not because 2018 will be the year all healthcare organizations will move
    all their technology to the cloud; but, 2018 and 2019 will be the years most healthcare
    organizations start to implement a cloud strategy that will take years to execute.
    Microsoft, Amazon, and Google can’t miss those opportunities.\n\nI was listening
    to a [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/02/13/box-kubernetes-migration-with-sam-ghods/)
    podcast last week featuring one of the founders of [Box](https://www.box.com/home).
    The podcast focused on how Box has embraced the public cloud and why they have
    chosen to leverage Kubernetes. It’s a fascinating listen. One of the takeaways
    that map to the cloud trend in health IT is around how moving to the cloud is
    never one and done, even if you only have one large, monolithic application (in
    the case of the podcast, the one application was Box).\n\n## Hybrid cloud for
    3-5 more years\n\nDuring the next 3-5 years, we’re going to see a hybrid approach
    to the cloud for health IT where there is a mix of cloud applications and ground-based,
    or on-premise applications. This necessitates a new integration strategy to ensure
    secure and reliable connectivity between cloud and existing ground applications,
    not just integration between legacy applications and new applications; ground
    applications are typically legacy applications. This hybrid cloud strategy also
    necessitates management of multiple forms of technology infrastructure, cloud,
    and ground or on-premise.\n\n## Legacy applications either killed off or re-architected
    for public cloud\n\nAs healthcare organizations implement and start to scale their
    cloud strategies, more ground-based applications will move to the public cloud.
    Some set of these legacy applications, likely the last to move to the cloud, will
    be migrated as they are currently architected; that, or they’ll be sunsetted and
    killed off before they are migrated. Many more of these legacy ground applications
    will be re-architected as a part of the migration process. The reason to re-architect
    legacy applications is to:\n\n1) fully take advantage of the cloud (auto-scaling,
    auto-healing, redundancy, portability, etc.) and\n2) prevent lock-in with a specific
    cloud provider. \n\nWhile AWS, Azure, and GCP offer great cloud services and resources,
    healthcare organizations will want optionality and to avoid lock-in with cloud
    providers APIs and the specific flavor of services (containers, serverless, etc.).
    This re-architecture process will be a crucial part of the cloud strategy for
    healthcare organizations.\n\n## Public cloud requires new skillsets\n\nThe public
    cloud does require a unique skill set and should usher in a new paradigm (containers,
    security, serverless, DBaaS, etc.) for healthcare technologies. Hiring resources
    with the necessary skillsets are challenging to say the least. It’s challenging
    if you’re in Seattle or Boston. It’s nearly impossible if you’re in a rural location
    like many healthcare organizations. Access to the right skillsets to leverage
    public cloud will improve over time but health systems should, and likely will,
    leverage third parties that specialize in cloud computing; these third parties
    have matured along with the public cloud.\n\n## Security and compliance — a big
    challenge\n\nOne particularly outsized challenge associated with the cloud is
    security and compliance. The cloud has distinct advantages over the current, on-premise
    model but it also has the perceptive challenge of giving up the keys to the castle
    to a cloud provider. This perceptive challenge can and will be overcome, but it
    requires changes to the way healthcare organizations manage risk for their data
    and how they align that risk with liability from cloud providers acting as stewards
    of their data. Transparency, both legally in the form of [BAAs](https://datica.com/blog/the-importance-of-business-associate-agreements-baas/)
    and [data processing agreements](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/) and technically
    in the form of security dashboards, have never been more critical.\n\n\nIn leveraging
    third parties, both cloud providers for infrastructure and cloud specialists for
    migration, security, and compliance, healthcare IT and healthcare compliance will
    transform themselves. What those groups look like in a post-cloud world is hard
    to say, but it’s clear they will have to change to embrace this brave new world.
    This will not happen overnight.\n\nA lot of the above are impacts that will be
    felt long-term and not necessarily in 2018. But, as healthcare organizations begin
    their [journey to the cloud](https://datica.com/blog/accelerating-migration-to-the-healthcare-cloud/),
    some starting that journey at HIMSS this year, they need to consider all of this.
    Cloud strategies should be all-encompassing but also should be revisited on some
    regular period as the pace of the cloud does not show any signs of slowing down.\n\nI

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
