:blog_lead: Last week the Datica team visited Las Vegas for the annual AWS re:Invent
  conference. As always, the event did not disappoint. AWS knows how to put on a show,
  getting grander every year. Here are a few observations from Datica's point of view.
:post: "## The MBAs got a hold of the cloud\n\nIn last year’s review I made a comment
  that has since been a story I tell when discussing the state of the cloud. It went
  something like this: \n\n*In 2014, 2015, and [2016](https://datica.com/blog/aws-reinvent-recap-2/),
  the cloud was still portrayed as a toy for developers. Most vendors on the expo
  floor focused on developer empowerment, and most tools were about building things.
  The sky was the limit.*\n\n*Then in [2017](https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/),
  it's like the MBAs got a hold of the cloud. It was stark how many new vendors flooded
  the expo, peddling tools to help control costs and security concerns.*\n\nIf we
  thought 2017 was about shifting away from being a toy, 2018 cemented that the future
  of the cloud is about controlling the cloud.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of vendors
  present were focused on tools to manage security, compliance, cost, and governance.
  In short, _risk_. \n\nThis is actually a good thing, much to the likely disappointment
  of engineers: Now that the cloud is considered a strategic part of the \"business\"
  it must be managed as if it's part of the business. Consequently, more cloud adoption
  is definitely on the horizon.\n\n![reinvent 18 exterior](//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/19LOdfDFKA8iAKcQUko4QW/6f759cd9788e91139d01693d60bb8946/reinvent_18_exterior_.jpg)\n\n##
  It is hard for buyers to know what to buy\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of
  tools are now focused on controlling the cloud, which is a good thing, the negative
  side is that the space around how to control your cloud is very confusing.\n\nMany
  tools tout \"guardrails\" and \"policy-driven development\", among many other terms
  of art. In the end, no matter how you slice it, there are too many companies saying
  too many different things while doing too similar of jobs. The recipe is buyer confusion,
  which isn't going to help with cloud adoption. An anecdote to underscore the point:
  across from the Datica booth was ZoHo — you know, the old-school CRM company — featuring
  a security monitoring service for AWS services; similarly, behind the Datica booth
  was CapitalOne — you know, the credit card company — who offered an undifferentiated
  security automation platform.\n\nBy our count, there were over 35 different companies
  with a booth (plus consultancies like Accenture,  et al) featuring some sort of
  security or governance tool. Dizzying.\n\nThis point is a good reminder to explain
  why Datica is different. We are very conscious of the fact that the security and
  compliance landscape has evolved considerably the last few years, which is why we
  are laser-focused on solving the specific problem Datica is best positioned to solve:
  managing healthcare-specific compliance on AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\nWe uniquely solve
  this problem because we are focused on the business problem of compliance, and *not*
  the technical or functional a single developer faces. The best way to explain is
  through the concept of the [maturity model](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-optimize-your-compliance-posture-with-a-maturity-model/).\n\n###
  Visualizing the business problems of compliance\n\n<div class=\"row container-gray-12
  collapse pad group align-middle align-justify\">\n  <div class=\"columns small-12
  medium-6\">\n    <figure>\n      <img class=\"\" alt=\"maturity model diagram w.
  continuum\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/4d7HgAMBriyoAOCYm0MGKg/538c5a18f98fa79bfe61a95265d451d4/maturity_model_diagram_w._continuum.png?w=640\"
  />\n      <figcaption>Fig. 1: Capability Maturity Model. The first stage, Privacy,
  is the most basic, with last stage achieving more complete compliance.</figcaption>\n
  \   </figure>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"columns small-12 medium-5\">\n    <h4>What
  is a Control?</h4>\n    <p>Example: <code>\"Users shall only be provided with access
  to\n    internal and external network services that\n    they have been specifically
  authorized to use.\n    Authentication and authorization mechanisms\n    shall be
  applied for users and equipment.\"</code></p>\n    <p>Each piece of technology needs
  to go through a similar process.</p>\n    <p>This is an example <strong>Capability
  Maturity Model</strong> that some frameworks use to understand the maturity of controls.</p>\n\n
  \ </div>\n</div>\n\nOver the last five years, Datica has been the expert at understanding
  the exact policies and procedures required to turn HIPAA-eligible services on the
  public cloud into architectures that can pass a [HITRUST CSF assessment](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/).
  The focus on policies and procedures (levels 1 and 2) then allows our customers
  to implement (level 3) the appropriate security controls with context. When complete,
  customers can then be assured that measuring and managing (levels 4 and 5) lead
  to the compliance verification required to pass audits. _That's what matters._\n\nIn
  contrast, the plethora of security tools flooding the space are just that—security
  tools, a.k.a level 3 implementation tools. They are functional pieces of software
  that allow developers to do security for the sake of security. Which, to be clear,
  is not a bad thing—all security is good in practice. However, within a healthcare
  context, organizations must be able to document and attest to security implementations
  that map all the way back to regulatory rules.  Privacy → Security → Compliance.
  The challenge of unaware security still exists with all other security tools, but
  not with Datica.\n\n## _AWS Comprehend_ is interesting\n\n[AWS launched a new service
  called Comprehend.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-starts-selling-software-to-mine-patient-health-records-1543352136)
  It's a natural language processor (NLP) tool for unstructured data sitting within
  EHRs. It was developed by a talented team led by Arun Ravi.\n\nCompliance is an
  area that still needs to be managed. An important disclaimer about compliance by
  the product:\n\n_\"[AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) does not
  meet the requirements for de-identification of protected health information under
  HIPAA. You are responsible for reviewing any output provided by Amazon Comprehend
  Medical to ensure it meets your needs.\"_\n\nWe are interested to see the use cases
  develop over the next few years. If you are working on a project and are interested
  in this service, but are unsure about the compliance requirements, feel free to
  email us.\n\nIt should be said, too, that getting the data is a critical requirement
  to use Comprehend. Datica's EHR integration service CMI is still the best service
  available. When combined with one of our compliance management tools, Comprehend
  is positioned to make an influential impact on clinical care. We're excited to see
  what our customers will do with it.\n\n## Outposts is the actual interesting part
  about healthcare and the cloud in 2019\n\nLastly, the announcement about the partnership
  with VMware to install AWS services and APIs on-prem via the new AWS service called
  Outposts was very interesting in a healthcare context.\n\nThis announcement is an
  interesting concession by AWS. With it, they are acknowledging that not only will
  it take time (decades) for certain cloud workloads to migrate from old data centers
  to the public cloud, but that some workloads _will never_ migrate.\n\nAzure has
  been operating under this point of view for a while with [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/),
  and this appears to be AWS's answer. Azure has had  success in this area; time will
  tell if AWS can match it.\n\nWhy this matters in healthcare should be pretty obvious:
  only a tiny fraction of healthcare workloads have actually made it to the public
  cloud so far. The vast majority still sit with legacy systems, buried in a basement
  or at a co-location facility.\n\n* __Compliance is _still_ a confusing concern__
  for many healthcare organizations, with a majority still preferring to control even
  the data center in order to pass audits.\n* __Update cycles are the longest of any
  industry.__ Many systems are at least 10 years old! It takes years for patches to
  happen.\n* __\"If it's not broke, don't fix it.\"__ What does that phrase mean within
  a healthcare context? Well, \"break\" doesn't mean using an outdated database...
  \"break\" means, _\"Did people die?\"_ Long story short: changing software that
  has proven to not kill people, to unknown software that could break and kill people,
  is a very different calculus than non-healthcare developers realize.\n* __EHRs will
  never be on the public cloud,__ generally speaking. Athena is making the biggest
  push and could do it, with Cerner an interesting observer. But, over the next decade,
  EHRs will never be on the cloud. Therefore with the central patient data repository
  sticking on-prem, why start to split your data to the public cloud?\n\nThese are
  among many other developments. The bottom line is that AWS Outposts, along with
  Azure Stack, are the true trojan horses to try to bridge healthcare data from old
  data centers to the public cloud."

    rather it takes time, knowledge, and even creativity to understand what exactly
    those configurations should be. This is especially true of healthcare compliance
    where no regime is going to tell you word for word how to configure your cloud
    environments. Instead, you're going to have to spend time and money understanding
    each framework, what applies to your organization, and how your organization is
    going to solve specific controls. You’ll then have to implement, measure and manage
    that policy in perpetuity, a task made more difficult by the highly dynamic nature
    of cloud services.
  :post: "\nAt Datica we've spent the last five years working at the intersection
    of cloud computing and healthcare compliance — we've talked with thousands of
    developers and engineers — we've built a portfolio of products that addresses
    these concerns head on. However, even in a world where you're using a product
    like [Datica's CKS](https://datica.com/compliant-kubernetes-service/), you'll
    likely have services and systems that live outside of that management layer. Understanding
    how to bring these services up to par in terms of compliance is anything but clear.\n\nIn
    our pursuit of making healthcare compliance more accessible to all, we're releasing
    configuration guides for popular cloud services like Amazon RDS, Azure Cosmos
    DB and Google Cloud SQL. These configuration guides are mapped to the [HITRUST
    CSF 9.1](https://hitrustalliance.net/whats-new-csf-v9-1/), which can easily be
    crosswalked to multiple compliance regimes like HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, NIST, etc,
    meaning these cloud configurations can easily be mapped to multiple compliance
    regimes. Our goal is to work with the community to eventually cover all cloud
    services available across these three major cloud providers.\n\n## These configurations
    provide a number of benefits\n\n1. Datica has been HITRUST certified for over
    four years and complies with HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR and GxP. These configurations
    are part of our core system and adhere to our [open source policies](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/).
    Users can freely implement these configurations, adopt the open source policies
    and have a verifiable, audit ready environment in a very short amount of time.\n2.
    They work well with Datica’s existing products. If you’re a Datica customer or
    are considering becoming one, you can rest easy knowing that these configurations
    provide the same level of compliance coverage that Datica’s managed products offer.
    This produces unparalleled compliance continuity, ultimately improving the efficiency
    of compliance audits.\n3. They’re free. Whether you’re a Datica customer or not,
    you can take these guides, implement them across your fleet of cloud services,
    and have an audit-ready environment without paying a dime.\n\n## Why we chose
    to start with Databases\n\nManaging stateful applications within Kubernetes is
    a notoriously difficult problem to solve. As a result, many organizations turn
    to cloud providers to offload this work. Services like [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/),
    [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), and
    [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) are popular among developers
    for their ease of use, scale and reliability. The demand we’ve received to support
    these services has been tremendous. As a result, the initial release of [Datica
    CCMS](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/) will come with support
    for these three services. The CCMS, coupled with these guides, will provide an
    end to end compliance management structure for your cloud environment.\n\n## Anatomy
    of the guides\n\nThese guides are intended to be step-by-step, opinionated tutorials
    that explain the relevance of a specific configuration within the context of HITRUST.
    For those unfamiliar with HITRUST (and its relationship to HIPAA), please [read
    through this HITRUST guide](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-hitrust/).\n\nIn
    these database guides we’ll walk through configuring each database to be HITRUST
    CSF ready and then show how the CCMS will continuously check these configurations
    via REST APIs (which you could programmatically implement yourself). To understand
    the structure of how we think about compliance at Datica, which is important to
    grasp in order to take full advantage of these guides, see the visualization below.\n\n![Ryan
    blog graphic](//images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/3V7Rsgt3kA6U6suGGUWwQw/1dea88970842b1cf8e9354650e30cf78/Ryan_blog_graphic.png)\n_The
    bridge between “Compliance Controls” and “Configurations” is policy, while the
    bridge between “Configurations” and “APIs” is measurement._\n\n\nDedicated compliance
    tools are often too focused on controls, that is, the specific requirements of
    regimes like HITRUST, HIPAA, GDPR and more. For developers this is an issue, because
    ultimately they need to understand exactly what a specific control means, and
    what configurations need to be in place in order to satisfy that requirement.
    Unfortunately these tools don’t provide such guidance. They assume knowledge of
    compliance and established policy.\n\nThe CCMS and these guides are different.
    By starting with the configurations, developers can immediately grasp and understand
    what needs to be done. Ex: “turn on encryption”. This configuration is very straight
    forward and not muddled in compliance jargon. Then, using the rest of the guide,
    developers can map that configuration back to a control, as well as an API call
    that would give them a programmatic way to ensure that configuration is in place
    (either at a point in time, or on a continuous basis).\n\n## Introducing the first
    three configuration guides\n\n1. [AWS RDS Guide - How to configure RDS to comply
    with HIPAA and HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/aws-rds-guide-how-to-configure-rds-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n2.
    [Azure Cosmos DB Guide - How to configure Cosmos DB to comply with HIPAA and HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/azure-cosmos-db-guide-how-to-configure-cosmos-db-to-comply-with-hipaa-and-hitrust/)\n3.
    [Google Cloud SQL Guide - How to configure GCP Cloud SQL to comply with HIPAA
    and HITRUST](https://datica.com/academy/google-cloud-sql-guide-how-to-configure-gcp-cloud-sql-to-comply-with-hipaa/)\n`\n\n##
    What's on your wish list?\n\nWe treasure feedback from developers like you and
    want to know which cloud services matter to you. [Fill out a survey here](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/survey/)
    to let us know which services you use as part of your product that need to be
    configured for HITRUST compliance. \n\n\n"

  :summary: 'On Wednesday, September 26th, Datica will host a webinar that will dive
    into the topic of how healthcare compliance has evolved in the cloud era. '
  :blog_lead: In 2013, when the final HIPAA Omnibus was ruled, compliance on the cloud
    was an opaque understanding. It took collaboration among cloud services providers
    such as AWS, Azure, and Google, digital health companies like Datica, and the
    good folks at HITRUST and Coalfire (among many deserving others) to collectively
    define what it meant.
  :post: |2

    The process has been hard. Along the way, we learned a lot while also building little mental models or explanations to help distill the evolving complexity into digestible chunks for those looking to make a dent in this industry. Many of those simplifications we put into our new book, [*Complete Cloud Compliance*](https://completecloudcompliance.com), which launched this month.

    The book tries to answer the question "What Really Is Compliance?" and we think we do a decent job for those who aren't a professional compliance officer. The concepts are familiar to those with deep compliance experience, but we believe are the most efficient explainer for those who truly aren't sure how to answer the question themselves. We thought, if we can help everyone else learn our compliance lessons over the past five years, we can make *our* dent in this industry.

    On Wednesday, September 26th, I'll be giving [a webinar where I dive deeper](https://datica.com/webinars/what-really-is-compliance/) into the topic. I will be summarizing many key concepts throughout the book. For those who have 45 minutes open over lunchtime, I encourage you to attend.

    A few big ideas we will explore tomorrow:

    * Compliance is not the same as security is not the same as privacy
    * Rules and controls are very different, and it's important to understand that
    * The faster you can map the difference between organizations, standards, frameworks, and regulations, the faster all these acronyms will make sense to you
    * The global nature of compliance
    * Why frameworks matter
    * How to map a compliance regime onto your cloud architecture

    Please join me on Wednesday. Feedback is always welcome!

  :summary: We recap the second half of the AWS Re:Invent conference with a look at
    how some of the announcements could be applicable to the healthcare domain.
  :blog_lead: "## A recap of the AWS re:Invent keynotes\n    \nWe're returning from
    three and a half days at the re:invent conference. It was an extraordinary event
    both in terms of the number of people attending but also in terms of the calibre
    and diversity of the attendees. I had some conversations where people reminisced
    about how re:invent has come to be **the** IT conference and has taken over the
    mantle from VMWorld. It also helps that the brands making presentations and sharing
    their knowledge are acknowledged leaders in their industry _viz_ Netflix (entertainment),
    Merck (life sciences), FINRA (finance), Twilio (messaging), Mapbox (mapping),
    enterprise IT (VMWare and Workday), McDonald's (fast food) and more. Every presentation
    in the keynote has slides filled with logos of major brands in every industry
    you can imagine. Each of the keynotes—the first by CEO Andy Jassy and the second
    by CTO Werner Vogels—were about two and a half hours long. Each was filled with
    product announcements and interspersed with customer presentations, all of which
    were illuminating and funny at times as well. The Snowmobile announcement, for
    one, was sheer showmanship (it was driven onto stage) and remains memorable for
    every attendee. It was also parked right next to our booth in the exhibit hall
    and had a constant stream of people coming by to take selfies and pose with it."
  :post: "![IMG 4343](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1enTmTaXO0e66UYSaIOiCI/a92c59be15c6ba00f63e1dd7d9492fb7/IMG_4343.jpg)\n\nWhile
    both keynotes were interesting from a technology perspective, I felt that it would
    be worthwhile to condense it down and explore how some of these announcements
    could be applicable to the healthcare domain.\n\n## Possible healthcare impact
    from major product announcements made and \n\n### EC2 instance sizes\n\n[EC2 instances][3]
    that are bigger, smaller and programmable were announced, to satisfy the least
    and the most compute / memory / storage hungry software. Some of these were geared
    to keep AWS way ahead of it's competitors and others such as [LightSail][4] (the
    preconfigured virtual private server - VPS) seemed to be directly targeted at
    niches serviced by companies like Digital Ocean. \n\nThis is important for healthcare
    and life sciences. As I wrote about [before][5], one of the primary use cases
    that the healthcare industry is focused on is big data analytics, which necessarily
    implies large scale data analysis which in turn requires pretty large scale machines.
    Given that elasticity is also possible with these machines, things such as genomic
    analysis and outcomes analysis is likely to benefit substantially. At the other
    end of the spectrum, smaller instances will allow innovation and other groups
    to dip their toes into the cloud or try out ideas quickly and cheaply.\n\n###
    AI and ML as an API\n\n[Rekognition][6] (image analysis and detection), [Polly][7]
    (text to voice with intelligence) and [Lex][8] (voice based AI and interaction),
    all accessible via an API were announced. Machine Learning (ML) via an API and
    UI was announced earlier with these new products now being able to be used in
    concert. While some believe that Google has a lead in the AI space given it's
    history and access to vast troves of data, AWS seems to be focusing it's efforts
    on enabling specific use cases that customers might have in specific domains and
    offering up the technology it uses internally in products such as Alexa / Echo.
    All of this seems to be in response to Google's announcements earlier about the
    availability of its solutions, it does seem that in conjunction with the data
    movement and compute solutions, AWS might be in a position to catch up with Google
    in this regard. It does seem like this is an attempt to also make the technology
    more ubiquitous and thus the de-facto. I wouldn't be surprised to see ML and AI
    models developed by customers made available to others on the AWS marketplace
    in a little while. \n\nAI and ML is, of course, extremely applicable to healthcare.
    Reams of data is available within EHRs, PACS, PBM systems, pharmacies and claims
    management systems. However, analyzing all this data requires the right set of
    people. Both from a deployment and ongoing system management perspective but also,
    even more importantly, from the data science perspective. Other industries are
    also jumping into the data fray which makes it very challenging to staff up on
    both the devOps as well as the data science roles. The above mentioned solution
    is an attempt by AWS to try and simplify access to this somewhat esoteric of fields.
    I would predict academic hospitals with its set of medical informaticists, medical
    students and researchers, seeing immediate use for this capability. Specifically
    Rekognition and the ML API...\n\nOn the consumer side too, we can expect to see
    Lex (with voice based commands to summon the nurse, control the temperature, raise
    and lower the bed, capturing patient feedback and many more) being put to use
    in various ways in hospitals and Polly on the web or inside clinical applications.
    The possibilities are quite staggering.\n\n### Embedded IoT software aka Greengrass\n\nAs
    a preloaded piece of software onto IoT chips and with pre-built security, AWS
    Lambda links, local storage and orchestration amongst devices, [Greengrass][9]
    was a major announcement that is very timely. Especially given the recent DDoS
    attacks initiated via IoT devices and also that the IoT trend is not slowing down
    anytime soon. \n\nDevices already exist within health systems and have been [recognized][10]
    to be very insecure. The capabilities described can make Greengrass the foundation
    for another generation of more intelligent and secure healthcare IoT devices.\n\n###
    VMWare Cloud on AWS\n\nThis had to have been one of the most significant [announcements][11]
    re enterprise IT. VMWare cloud (vMotion), vSphere (compute), NSX (networking)
    and vSAN (storage) are all deployed on bare metal machines on AWS. Enterprise
    IT teams used to working in the VMWare world can now move seamlessly from one
    to the other. This is likely to speed up adoption of the AWS cloud significantly.
    There was no mention of exclusivity from VMWare so we can expect to see similar
    announcements coming soon from Azure and Google.\n\nHealthcare and life sciences
    are still in the early stages of the move to the cloud but this VMWare cloud on
    AWS could be just the thing that could act as the catalyst to accelerate that
    movement. However, the issues around compliance (HIPAA, HITRUST and GxP) remain
    open and need to be addressed. We do see this as an area of opportunity for us.\n\n###
    Cloud-first data management tools\n\n[Step Functions][12] (workflow management),
    [Glue][13] (ETL), [Athena][14] (S3 querying) were all geared towards enabling
    and simplifying data movement and massaging needed to enable analytics and machine
    learning capabilities. With expanding capabilities, it does seem that AWS could
    be considered competitive to companies such as Mulesoft. \n\nThis is pretty significant
    in that this is billed only a use basis, which implies that you no longer have
    to buy expensive upfront licenses but only as needed. This can have an immediate
    impact for healthcare startups as well as for the innovation groups in healthcare
    institutions.\n\n### Automatic DDoS protection\n\n[Shield][15] was a great announcement
    which essentially provides **all** AWS customers with core DDoS protection (volumetric
    and TCP) automatically and for no extra charge. Advanced versions are also available
    of course at a higher price. But this free offering is a great first step to address
    the concerns that some customers have raised with us as well. While it makes marketing
    sense, it also makes sound business sense to AWS because DDoS attacks on any of
    their customer accounts will have a cascading impact on other customer's workloads
    and secondly, there are bound to be issues with the final bill post attacks. \n\nThis
    further removes the security concerns felt by CIOs and CISOs in health systems
    and plans especially given that basic protection is automatically put into place
    and leverages the cumulative man-years of knowledge that AWS has in protecting
    it's own and it's customer's infrastructure.\n\n### Easier data transfer to the
    cloud\n\nI wrote about the challenge that a lot of the customer's continue to
    face in moving data to the cloud from their datacenters in the [previous post][5].
    This has been addressed by using much larger capacity [Snowballs][16] with some
    enhancements and compute ability and for very large data transfers measured in
    exabytes, a tractor trailer sized device, called the [Snowmobile][17].\n\n## Summary\n\nTwo
    key points.\n\n1. With a revenue run rate of $15 Billion—and a projected growth
    rate of 55% YoY that as a business size dwarfs the next 14 competitors put together—the
    AWS business is enormous.\n\n2. The move to the cloud, while not in it's infancy,
    is only just in it's pre-teen years.\n\nWe can expect to see AWS as the market
    leader and the de-facto choice of many of the CIOs in healthcare. Given Amazon's
    history of expanding into related spaces, it is not surprising to see it expand
    into domains led by companies by New Relic, Digital Ocean and Mulesoft. While
    AWS' offerings might not be as full featured as the established, we can safely
    predict that in a year or less, they are likely to be at feature parity which
    should be a source of concern for those companies.\n\nThe healthcare industry
    can leverage a lot of these new capabilities. We expect to see immediate uptake
    on the larger machine sizes for big data and analytics, short term uptake on the
    ML and AI toolsets especially in academic healthcare and medium to long term adoption
    of the Greengrass toolkit for innovative device development and use. \n\nIt will
    be interesting to see how Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM SoftLayer, and others do
    to counter next year.\n\n[3]: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\n[4]:

  :summary: This was Datica's first time attending AWS Re:invent along with 32,000
    attendees ranging from engineers to CIOs and a broad range of industries.
  :blog_lead: This is the first time that we at Datica are attending AWS Re:invent.
    We always knew that the event was large but we're surprised to see and hear that
    the event has grown substantially since last year. AWS re:invent expects to have
    about 32,000 attendees this year with attendee profiles ranging from engineers
    to CIOs and a broad range of industries.
  :post: |-
    This is a recap of observations during the first half of the conference. We'll publish another recap at the end of the conference.

    From what we understand this is the first year that there was a specific track and presentations focused around healthcare and life sciences with some big names presenting. This track was on Monday before the formal kickoff on Tuesday when the keynotes begin to happen. Presenters included the following:

    * **Cambia**: who spoke on large scale machine learning and data science / big data
    * **Cerner**: who spoke about having an on-demand DR strategy for their HealtheIntent platform
    * **Merck**: who spoke about remaining in continuous compliance with life sciences and other regulatory standard
    * **UCSC** Genomics Institute: who spoke about large scale cancer genomic data analysis
    * **Claritas Genomics**: who participated in a panel with Motorola and Coursera discussing how to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in education (FERPA), healthcare (HIPAA) and legal (CJIS).

    These tracks were extremely popular with long lines. The overflow lines were very long as well and wound around entire hallways.

    As you can gather from the talk titles themselves, a lot of the focus was on regulatory requirements and big data. We saw compliance emerge as potentially the most important topic amongst healthcare.

    Healthcare, being more conservative than most industries, is embarking down this cloud journey with hybrid cloud deployments being the initial strategy. Organizations want to move to the cloud, but not immediately. They are looking for more of a transition.

    The move to the cloud is being looked at as an opportunity because various reasons such as:

    * **Cost of Elasticity**: as mentioned earlier, a lot of the initial efforts seem to be focused around big data and analytics. The numbers thrown out during those sessions were invariably in the multiple petabytes range. At that scale, the cloud is an ideal option with immediate scale available as needed.
    * **Clean slate**: While some organizations have been in the cloud for a little while, the move to the cloud gives these organizations a chance to re-do and re-architect their solutions. Such as making them more service oriented, more micro services etc.
    * **Repeatability and reusability**: While there is a heavy initial focus on the US, the organizations are also global in scope. With the added regulations around data sovereignty that are being imposed by governments, any IT strategy must be globally scalable. The cloud with multiple points of presence globally allows for addressing this need in a much more cost effective and faster manner.
    * **Building DevOps competency**: This is increasingly important. Companies are realizing that scaling locally or globally requires automation. Especially because of repeatability as that is a core requirement for regulatory purposes. Managing separate global deployments becomes cost effective only if they're not snowflakes.
    * **Availability of toolsets**: With a plethora of services such as EMR (elastic map reduce) which includes support for Hadoop, Spark etc., prebuilt AMIs to support analytics such as Tableau, Qlik and more, RDS and more, initial setup and learning curves are much shortened.
    * **Simplified logging and audit trails**: A lot of the regulatory requirements come down to detailed audit trails and data extraction from logs. The cloud provides these raw data spouts quickly. Some effort is required, of course, to connect, parse and present this raw data in a usable format.

    While all that is great, there still are some challenges.

    1. ** Volume of data**: There is no simple answer here especially because of the large volumes of data mentioned earlier. Things like Snowball help get the initial load done but ongoing challenges like DR (disaster recovery) remain a challenge. Especially if that requires a 2x investment in infra. Cerner has approached this through an on-demand DR strategy where the raw data is replicated always but the infra needed to run analytics etc is spun up whenever needed and data reprocessed. This has the challenge of a full 100% recovery taking up to 12 hours but is still an impressive effort.
    2. **Networking and encryption in transit**: Networking is still a bit esoteric and challenging especially in the compliance world combined with enterprisey components. Combined these two require full encryption in-transit using rotating TLS keys, 2FA (two factor authentication), ADFS (Active Directory Federation Service) and IAM (AWS' Identity and Access Management) integrations and ongoing management of ACLs. Additional requirements like bastion servers gating access and separate VPCs for "management" and compute / data are also recommended as best practice.

    ## Summary

    It looks like the move to the cloud is accelerating in healthcare and life sciences. Big data and analytics seem to be at the vanguard of this effort. Disaster recovery on demand also seems to be of value. Hybrid strategies leveraging existing investment and the cloud as an extension of that seems to be the first step.

  :body: "## What is AWS?\n\n<img src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6jIaQReY80cKKGiCAIUcO8/1bc13adfdccc6214ec207f49120a32b0/aws-logo.png\"
    width=\"200\" class=\"float-right-on-medium\" alt=\"Amazon Web Services (AWS)\">\n\nAmazon
    Web Services (AWS), like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or IBM Softlayer, provides
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the form of a Public Cloud. In a Public
    Cloud, the data centers are owned and managed by the cloud provider but are made
    available through a shared service model to the general public or industry groups.\n\nHealthcare
    developers often prefer public clouds like AWS since pay-as-you-go pricing models
    provide economies of scale and the same levels of security and compliance can
    be achieved today as on private clouds. \n\n## How does the Datica Platform work
    with AWS?\n\nAWS is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. Datica is
    a Platform as a Service (PaaS) company and Datica is an APN Healthcare Partner
    of Amazon AWS. Our PaaS requires an IaaS, and we use AWS by default at all [levels
    of our platform](https://datica.com/pricing/). At the enterprise-level, the Datica
    Platform is also available on multiple clouds including Microsoft Azure, Rackspace,
    or IBM SoftLayer. When it comes down to it, we basically make AWS easier to use
    for the healthcare developer market. It’s less expensive, less time-intensive,
    less risky, and a better experience to use Datica to reap the benefits of AWS
    than for makers of digital health applications to deploy on AWS directly.\n\n<script

    Datica supports three types of AWS customers:\n\n1. Those who just want to use
    a multi-tenant cloud. These organizations are Datica customers and are on Datica’s
    AWS account.\n2. Those who need dedicated resources like VMs. These organizations
    are Datica customers and are on Datica’s AWS account.\n3. Those who already have
    their own AWS Account and want to install some of Datica’s technology on it, which
    we call “On-Account” customers. These organizations have both Datica and AWS accounts.\n\n##
    Is AWS HIPAA Compliant?\n\nBeing compliant with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is not easily defined. So, is AWS HIPAA compliant?
    Yes! But, to be clear, just because AWS is HIPAA compliant and your application
    runs on AWS doesn’t mean that you are HIPAA compliant too. Here’s where it gets
    complicated. AWS is HIPAA compliant exactly to the extent they are required to
    be at the infrastructure level and as spelled out in their [Business Associate
    Agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/). \n\n<div
    class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n###

    [Who does HIPAA impact?](http://content.datica.com/who-does-hipaa-impact)\n\n</div>\n\nYou’re
    not building infrastructure though, you are building an application and that adds
    greatly to the list of HIPAA controls that apply to you. In other words, the specific
    subset of the hundreds of HIPAA controls that apply to your company and product
    is a different subset than those that apply to AWS. To be deemed HIPAA compliant,
    and prove that with a HITRUST Certification, you only need to comply with the
    subset of controls that apply in your case.  \n\nThose additional controls vary
    depending on your specific case but, generally, include additional infrastructure-level
    controls, application-level controls and controls at the company level. AWS has
    what they call a shared responsibility model which means when you build your application
    directly on top of AWS, you have to take it the other 90% of the way toward HIPAA
    compliance. \n\nDatica’s platform includes AWS and takes you the rest of the way
    down the path toward full HIPAA compliance at the infrastructure level, and further
    down the path toward compliance at the company and application levels so you can
    focus on the functionality of your application and not on compliance. With Datica,
    you get a compliant platform for deploying and managing critical healthcare applications
    in the cloud.\n\n## Does HIPAA Matter on AWS?\n\nHIPAA kicks in when a digital
    health product handles Protected Health Information (PHI). There are several [different
    categories of PHI](https://datica.com/dhsf/#compliance-does-hipaa-matter), like
    someone’s name, home address, or phone number. When a digital health product stores,
    processes, or transmits PHI, HIPAA asserts rules as to how it should handle a
    multitude of security, privacy, and policy procedures, called “controls”. In HIPAA
    terms, there are physical, technical, and administrative \"safeguards\". Datica
    manages the physical and technical safeguards of HIPAA at the infrastructure-level,
    leaving you to the administrative HIPAA safeguards, which are almost always custom
    to your organization, and a few remaining technical safeguards within your [application
    code](https://datica.com/guide/application-hipaa-compliance/) itself. Thus, Datica
    provides more than two-thirds of what it takes to be HIPAA compliant. Demonstrating
    that a company and its digital health product meets all those controls is how
    it can call itself compliant. \n\n## Understanding AWS Primitives\n\nAWS offers
    about 53 different services, or cloud primitives, to provide a great amount of
    flexibility in order to make it possible for any AWS healthcare developer to bundle
    what they need for their application’s infrastructure. Some well-known examples
    of these services are Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. We bundle a subset
    of those 53 primitives (a majority of the 37 that are [HIPAA-eligible services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/)
    like CloudTrail (for logging) and S3 (for object storage) together into the Datica
    Platform to address the specific use case of building, maintaining, and running
    a cloud-based digital health application that creates, receives, maintains, or
    transmits PHI in a HIPAA compliant manner. \n\n### Services Included in the Datica
    Platform\n\n![How the datica platform works@2x](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/1PDK1PG3dyEIsyWIewYqc8/46057be71944e1972176559bec9e8134/How_the_datica_platform_works_2x.png)\n\n##
    What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nHere’s a high-level summary: The
    AWS shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF
    the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud.
    That means, if you were to deploy your application right on AWS instead of the
    Datica Platform, you’d be responsible for setting up and maintaining everything
    beyond the basic cloud infrastructure — and that includes not only the work and
    expense to do that but also the risks of security for everything else. \n\nThe
    cloud infrastructure that AWS is responsible for includes the hardware, software,
    networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.\n\n- Security in the cloud
    (i.e. the customer’s responsibilities) is dependent on the exact application being
    developed and which cloud services are being used by the customer. In general,
    AWS customers are responsible for security, including HIPAA compliance, on all
    of the following:\n- Client-side data encryption & Data Integrity Authentication\n-
    Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)\n- Network traffic protection
    (encryption, integrity, identity)\n- Operating System, network, and firewall configuration\n-
    Platform, applications, identity, and access management\n- Customer Data\n\nCustomers
    of Datica benefit from the fact that our BAA extends the security coverage of
    AWS HIPAA Compliance to pick up responsibility where AWS leaves off. Another way
    to think of it is that AWS takes your infrastructure about 10% of the way toward
    HIPAA Compliance, while if you use the Datica Platform, Datica's [HIPAA mappings](https://hipaa.datica.com)
    take you much further toward 100% compliance. That means you not only eliminate
    the need for the labor, expense, or time of all of the above, but you also pass
    the risk of security onto Datica for everything our much more extensive BAA covers.

    Why the Datica Platform on AWS is the Best Option\n\nWhen making the decision
    on whether to build out the requisite infrastructure for your application yourself
    vs. buying the pre-built Datica Platform that already includes AWS, here are the
    major points to keep in mind:\n\n* Building all of this yourself is possible,
    and setting up the individual primitives is, in fact, not the hard part. Ensuring
    compliance while orchestrating the DevOps between all the components in an ongoing
    and compliant basis with each and every deployment IS the hard part. Datica does
    that for you.\n* It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility
    model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you)
    are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Choosing the Datica Platform
    means Datica picks up that responsibility and the burden of risk where AWS leaves
    off.\n* Making each cloud primitive service HIPAA compliant might be straightforward
    but not if you plan to employ any modern environment paradigms — namely containerization
    and orchestration via Docker or Kubernetes — that require an added level of development
    and maintenance that isn’t achieved by simply making a single primitive compliant.\n\n###
    Typical Healthcare Deployment Process Comparison on AWS Directly vs. Datica\n\n[![Datica

    you build everything yourself, you also shoulder the risk. In contrast, Datica’s
    BAA takes on all of the infrastructure-level risk. \nMake life easier with a single
