:post: |-
  ## Physician Health

  Perhaps one of the more underrated phenomena in healthcare is physician burnout. There isn't nearly enough attention paid to the topic compared to its national prevalence and deep negative impact on overall patient care. In many ways, an unfair majority of innovations and new technologies are focused on the patient, and not enough are focused on the humans caring for the patient, so to speak.

  Day One featured almost zero discussion on the topic, but Day Two started off with several mentions and then escalated to a consistent theme on both the main stage and in breakout sessions.

  In short, clinicians, and physicians specifically, are frustrated. They are burnt out.

  "Physicians spend 2 hours typing to every 1 hour seeing patients," said [Jesse Ehrenfeld][1] of the AMA on stage.

  We then heard over and over how unhappy the provider cohort is with the state of technology and the burden new technology is putting on them.

  This is a big deal.

  ## What is the future of "interoperability"?

  The day brought several presentations from different organizations discussing the very thing Day One participants begged to have: better collaboration and partnership. (In fact, that message was echoed again: Walgreens and the U.S. Government both said on stage they view collaboration among organizations as the single biggest key to their growth objectives.)

  We saw APIs talk about silver bullets, and that being the path towards interoperability.

  We saw PHRs talk about the importance and magic of putting data into patients' hands via mobile apps, and that being an example of interoperability.

  We saw Blockchain—again.

  We saw new sources of data, or different data types, and that being a new angle on interoperability.

  We then saw apps who get data into the hands of doctors via tablets as a breakthrough in interoperability, but didn't really discuss how they get the data, just that they display the data.

  Here's the thing: What we didn't have was voices from Epic, Cerner, eCW, or McKesson talking about how they would make data access via their EHRs easier. We didn't hear how providers and payers have little to no incentive—still, even with value-based payments looming—to share their data. And we didn't have a conversation around the politics it takes to complete simple integrations, which are the building blocks of interoperability.

  We're not sure Health 2.0 can really tell you what the future of interoperability is. In many ways, it's an idyllic vision, and should be what we are all striving towards. But in many other ways, the conference seems to skirt talking about the real issues that make interoperability tough. Issues that are dirty, muddy, boring, not fun, serious, multi-faceted, and take forever.

  ## Interfaces (UX/UI) are really maturing

  There were many impressive demos throughout the entire day. People are working on truly novel ideas that look gorgeous, even if interoperability is still a challenge!

  A big take away is the maturity in application interfaces. Things are really getting good.

  By far the best demo of the entire conference was from [Human Longevity][2]. Not only was their gene sequence search tool mind-blowing, but it was so obvious their interface—a simple search box!—is the eventual endgame for data discovery. Think about it: Digital Natives (could also be said as "Millennial Doctors") are already accustomed to a simple search box. They already know how to slice and dice via an input mechanism. This has been discussed at length in other industries where "bots" and "chat interfaces" are exploding in popularity. It's a thing. A hierarchical taxonomy for the navigation of an EHR is so...pre-Google. Eventually getting to the point of powerful search, layered with bots and true machine learning, is the future. Like the _real_ future, one that is adopted by clinicians.

  Other interfaces were impressive, too. Demos featuring voice technology, especially Amazon's Alexa, were fantastic. We thought [WELL Health][3] had an elegant and impressive app UI that could be adopted instantly by the target user base.

  If there is one thing healthcare _can_ learn from it's industry siblings, is that true, differentiating innovation can happen at the human interface layer. Google, Slack, Apple, and others have taught us this. The other compelling insight is interface innovations are often the easiest new technologies to absorb. There is no reason why search, "feeds and speeds", or voice inputs can't be a true wedge.

  :post: "## Diversity of care\n\nOne of the more powerful themes that sets up a tentpole
    topic for 2017 is the diversity of types of care. It's now obvious there are several
    different types of care. Health 2.0 explained it like such:\n\n* Healthy patients
    are lighter touch\n* Chronically Ill patients require maintained focus\n* Acutely
    Ill patients are at risk and a priority\n* Healthy patients on the verge of becoming
    Chronically Ill are concerns and should be monitored\n* Chronically Ill patients
    on the verge of becoming Acutely Ill are a danger\n* Meanwhile Acutely Ill can
    come back to Chronically Ill through certain care\n* And Acutely Ill can go back
    to being Healthy patients\n\nWhew, a lot of bullet points. What does it mean?\n\nSimply
    this: We are starting to understand better than ever as technologists where Digital
    Health products and services belong along the continuum of care.\n\nBut more importantly
    the opposite is true, too. _One size does not fit all._ Diversity of patients
    combined with diversity of care situations means healthcare requires a diversity
    of products and innovations.\n\nThe bummer, as we heard all week, is this also
    means physicians and health system decision makers (CIOs, et al) are inundated
    with too many solutions, too many options, too many things to divert focus.\n\nWhat
    will be interesting is where this diversity point and the over-burden point meet.
    That feels where real progress will be made.\n\n## Is it time for Health 3.0?\n\nJonathan
    Bush, CEO of [athenahealth][1], provided the biggest spark of the conference,
    in the only way he can. He took Health 2.0 to task. \"Health 2.0 needs to die
    along with the old concept of interoperability,\" was the shocking call out. \n\nWait,
    what? It was actually quite powerful. Jonathan's point was \"health 2.0\" as a
    concept is tied to \"digital health\" as a patient-centric, empathic focus on
    technological innovation, which is totally cool, but we have largely convinced
    everyone of the importance, so now we should build on top of that and focus on
    what's next. We need to move onto \"health 3.0\" with bigger ideas. His positioning
    of \"what's next\" is a new concept of interoperability. No longer should we consider
    \"interoperability\" as the drudgery of connecting unique, replica systems everybody
    maintains on their own. Instead it should be \"networked health\" of authoritative
    yet connected datasets.\n\nIt's compelling, and my paragraph doesn't do the justice
    of Jonathan's hour-long delivery, which was rousing.\n\nWe share a similar view
    (though still consider data central to the future of healthcare, obviously). In
    a way, the path towards interoperability is more about connections and networks,
    and less about data. You could say the more healthcare is networked, the better
    the data will get, anyways.\n\n## Focus on the patient\n\nLastly, we should call
    out the importance of the patient in all of this. It was a popular topic throughout
    most panels, and the majority of all demos the entire day focused on the patient.
    It's important to never forget.\n\nA quote from Darren Dworkin, CIO of Ceders-Sinai,
    was exceedingly insightful. He said, \"Where our digital health experiments have
    failed are when new innovations thin the patient-clinician relationship too much.
    We can't get ahead of our skis too much. It's ultimately about the patient-clinician
    relationship.\"\n\nThis is a fine point to end the conference. While we are here
    to improve patient outcomes at lower costs (a favorite mantra of HCO executives),
    all of healthcare is ultimately two-sided. You have the patient but you'll always
    have the clinician too. Technology needs to not only improve the life of the clinician,
    but the relationship between the two.\n\n[1]: http://athenahealth.com"

    which told a unified story and compelling insight worth sharing. '
  :blog_lead: |-
    Day One of Health 2.0 featured the annual Traction startup pitch session. Many interesting companies presented, from [biome.io][1] to [strollhealth.com][2]. The panel prior had compelling insight worth sharing. The group of investors told a unified story across several key conversation topics:

    [1]: http://biome.io/
    [2]: http://strollhealth.com/
  :post: "* Digital Health is in the \"Trough\" of the Gartner hype cycle. There was
    a lot of promise, now under delivery, but eventually will get to the Plateau of
    Maturity. They are hopeful, but it needs to be said that Digital Health is not
    accomplishing what it promised.\n* A focus on ROI with a partnership-based relationship
    is the key to gaining tractions for Digital Health. \n* They see a lot of unintentional
    exits in the next year due to underperforming by Digital Health startups. \n*
    So many ideas are \"cute\" and addressing the over-served \"FitBit\" population,
    and not enough ideas are tackling the hard problems in other populations, like
    the elderly or social safety nets.\nThe rest of the day consisted of a few themes.
    \ \n\n## Blockchain\n\nThe first was all about Blockchain—a radical concept responsible
    for Bitcoin and innovations in FinTech—that is now starting to creep over into
    healthcare. \n\nMany proponents of the Blockchain claim hefty promises.  \n\n*
    It will be the catalyst to finally eliminate paper usage.\n* It will de-risk fraud.\n*
    It will be the endgame for identity management.\n* It will be invisible and thus
    the new CPU to all future cloud computation.\nAt the Blockchain panel, skeptics—from
    Taariq Lewis of [Serica][3] present on the panel, to a gentleman asking questions
    during the Q&A—asked thoughtful questions. Taariq isn't sure the Blockchain is
    the right technology for identity because it wasn't designed to work that way.
    He's also wary anytime mentions \"smart contracts\" because they aren't always
    what they appear to be. And once a \"smart contract\" is created, it doesn't end,
    much like a bot. A questioner at the end wondered if current approaches to the
    Blockchain in healthcare are the \"Friendster of Healthcare Blockchain technology\",
    in that it helps create awareness but ultimately gets a lot of early things wrong.\n\nTime
    will tell how real Blockchain really is in healthcare, but a major takeaway on
    Day One is the hype wave is cresting at its highest peak.\n\nAfter the panel,
    I overheard an older gentleman telling someone else, \"I went to this because
    I had heard about this blockchain thing but have no idea how it works or what
    it even is.\"\n\nInterest piqued, I stopped and asked him a few brief questions.
    Turns out this fellow worked for an HCO, and was investigating whether new blockchain
    concepts could help their technology strategy.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly how I
    would use the concept of a blockchain today, but the idea sounds cool,\" he told
    me. \"I worry that it's being billed as the savior for so many different problems,
    like identity management to revenue cycle management to eliminating fraud.\"\n\nThis
    is the insight worth considering with Blockchain. It most definitely will have
    a major influence in healthcare. Somehow, someday. But the technology is still
    immature, and the concept so new and foreign to almost all decision makers within
    healthcare, that it is inappropriately being billed as the fix-all for every problem
    healthcare faces. This risks the technology over-promising and under-delivering.
    \ \n\n## The Unacceptables\n\nThe second half of the day was more nuanced. It
    was a collection of presentations, panels, and discussions around what was dubbed
    \"The Unacceptables\" by Health 2.0.\n\nA few years ago, they put forth \"The
    Unmentionables.\" These were topics such as stress and exercise which affected
    health, but were rarely considered or quantified by providers and payers alike.\n\nIn
    a declaration of victory, Health 2.0 moved on from The Unmentionables and is now
    putting scope around The Unacceptables. These are topics such as diversity, violence,
    and other topics holding healthcare innovation back.\n\nTo Health 2.0's credit,
    they facilitated several different types of conversations around the idea, beyond
    just workshops and Lunch & Learns. Harvery Fineberg, president of Gordon and Betty
    Moore Foundation, gave a rousing speech on designing systems to better healthcare.
    We welcome the foundation's attention.   \n\n## Digital Snake Oil\n\nDr. James
    Madara conducted a one-on-one to discuss partnerships with MATTER and his role
    with Health 2.0's SMART initiative.\n\nThe topic mirrored similar threads throughout
    the day. Digital Health has not succeeded at delivering on the promises given
    a few years ago, but the benefits it can deliver are very real, and very important.\n\nIt's
    up to healthcare broadly, and decision makers specifically, to treat relationships
    more like a partnerships, and work together towards implementing the changes needed
    to improve the system as a whole.\n\n[3]: https://sericatrading.com/"
