:summary: In this article, we explore the migration to cloud computing in healthcare,
  the benefits of cloud computing in healthcare, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
:blog_lead: "I saw an article recently titled, [“Hospital datacenters: Extinct in
  5 years?”](http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-datacenters-extinct-5-years)
  that made my jaw drop just a bit. The race to the cloud is unquestionably taking
  place in just about every other industry. More than half of the CIOs polled at last
  year’s Gartner Symposium IT Expo are moving away from a captive data center environment
  and working toward a cloud-first strategy. \n\nThe healthcare industry is notoriously
  the laggard in that migration and, up until now, healthcare’s race to the cloud
  has looked more like a slow walk. So, five years may be a bit ambitious.\n\nEven
  so, the healthcare cloud migration is gaining steam among hospitals and health systems
  today. In fact, healthcare cloud spending is expected to rise nearly threefold,
  from $3.73 billion in 2015 to [$9.48 billion by 2020](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/).\n\nIn
  this article, we explore the state of cloud computing in healthcare today, the benefits
  of cloud computing in the healthcare industry, and HIPAA cloud compliant hosting.
  \n"
:post: "![Cloud spending in healthcare on the rise](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/59j42nAkjKawoAK60kCyEY/da74cb1359d706ad4d1b2b039e3f6f43/blog-cloud-spending-in-healthcare-_2x.png)\n\n##
  The State of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Today\n\n> “These are the two transformational
  changes in healthcare — value pressure and the digitization of healthcare. So when
  you ask me what I’m obsessing about today in my role running a fairly large unit
  at UCSF, it’s the value pressure. We have to figure out ways to provide better,
  safer, and more satisfying care at a lower cost… The value pressure is real and
  causing important changes in the way we think about our work and organize ourselves.”
  — Robert Wachter, MD, Professor, Department of Medicine at USCF, from the [Datica
  Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/robert-wachter-md/)\n\nCIOs
  and CMIOs across the healthcare ecosystem are feeling pressured to modernize quickly
  while keeping costs low. To follow are some of the key pressures driving accelerated
  migration to cloud computing.\n\n## Value to The Business\nAcross all industries,
  migration to the cloud is often a business decision to remain competitive by funding
  innovation. CIOs today are partnering with business department owners to help them
  find ways to shift funds into the things that really matter both to them and to
  the business strategy as a whole. \n\nCloud usage at hospitals and health systems
  is often centered around managing business applications to achieve those financial
  efficiencies. It is not as simple looking at the costs of running those applications
  on-premise, in the cloud, or on hybrid infrastructure. The conversation between
  healthcare CIOs and their business leaders has to focus on how much value it brings
  to the business as a whole. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Healthcare
  as a Business\nThe cloud makes it possible to hold more information and also do
  it a lower cost. This allows even the [smallest hospitals access to the kind of
  storage](http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jul/28/six-key-benefits-cloud-computing-healthcare-industry/)
  that allows them to provide the most value, without a hefty price tag. Shifting
  to the cloud and decommissioning old servers means healthcare IT departments can
  shift that money to fund innovation projects in the organization. \n\n## Value to
  Patients\nHealthcare today is rapidly shifting from a volume-based, fee-for-service
  model, to the newer value-based model outlined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
  In the value-based care world, providers are graded based on the value to the patient
  as opposed to the volume of services. \n\nTo explain the difference further, the
  fee-for-service model, which has been the standard for a long time, rewarded physicians
  and hospitals for filling beds and conducting numerous tests and treatments. On
  the other hand, the newer, value-based care model rewards providers on cost-effectiveness
  and clinical case outcomes. This change requires rapid innovation that only cloud
  computing can cost-effectively provide.\n\nIn addition to those changes in payment
  models, patients’ perceptions of value are quickly changing. To understand this,
  it’s crucial to think of patients as consumers, [and those consumers are adapting
  to offloading nearly every aspect of their lives into the cloud](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Impact-of-Cloud-Computing-on-Healthcare.pdf).
  Our dependency on instant access to everything, from news, answers, and financial
  records to our social interactions, has changed our expectations in all areas of
  our lives. \n\nAlong with this digitalization, consumers are taking control of their
  own data in innovative ways as apps track, store, and analyze personal data on everything
  from our heart rate to our credit score trends. From a consumer point of view, expectations
  in data availability are seamless from one part of their lives to the next. They
  not only expect to be able to access all of their own healthcare data, just as they
  do with their bank data, but they expect to be able to provide the data they’re
  generating with wearables and apps back to healthcare providers. \n\n### The Benefits
  of Healthcare Cloud Computing to Patient Value\nCloud computing enables hospitals
  and health systems to face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides
  them with a connected environment to exchange data with their patients. It also
  provides the means to handle the massive amounts of data that are growing exponentially
  in a cost-efficient manner. On-premise infrastructure costs are high and data scalability
  is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Interoperability\nInteroperability, both internally
  and externally, is a growing pressure on healthcare CMIOs and CIOs. Not only is
  there a need to easily exchange data between internal departments, for example,
  between an EHR and billing system, but there is also an increasing demand from consumers
  and the industry as a whole to be able to make patient data exchangeable with other
  organizations. \n\n### The Benefits of Cloud Computing to Interoperability\nCloud
  computing as an IT platform facilitates information sharing across the healthcare
  ecosystem, enabling cross-industry services and making internal data exchange faster
  and more cost-effective.\n\n## Demands for Faster Innovation\n> “It’s very similar
  economics to road building. It’s the creation of infrastructure that enables exchange
  to happen. Everybody’s interested in a cheaper way to get from A to B. But not everybody’s
  interested in what is required to create a cheaper way to get from A to B.” — Grahame
  Grieve, Director, Healthcare Intersections, from the [Datica Healthcare Innovators
  Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt3/) \n\nHealthcare consumerism
  is an underlying trend that ultimately makes cloud adoption essential to provider
  success. Healthcare organizations need to make very quick decisions about integrations
  and new technology. Their innovation centers require a quick, affordable, and secure
  platform to rapidly test while maintaining the confidentiality of patient information.
  That platform needs to be scalable as the size and quantity of data sets grow exponentially.
  It also needs to be interoperable for internal and external collaboration.\n\nThese
  [innovation demands](https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/jun/27/why-healthcare-industrys-move-cloud-computing-accelerating/)
  are driving an acceleration of cloud computing in healthcare today. \n\n### Benefits
  of Cloud Computing for Innovation \nAs hospitals transform to modern, digital enterprises
  and value-based payment models, they need to find innovative ways to quickly test
  and evaluate integrations and technology options. Cloud platforms allow for the
  agility and speed to innovate while lowering the barriers to innovation. \n\n##
  HIPAA Compliant Cloud Hosting\n> “Healthcare is undergoing massive technological
  transformation. Datica's approach to HIPAA compliance means Microsoft Azure customers
  can utilize trusted solutions to privacy and data security which meet the highest
  levels of healthcare standards. We're excited to offer a HITRUST CSF Certified platform
  such as Datica in the Azure ecosystem.” — Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director Product
  Marketing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp.\n\nHealthcare data management includes
  strict requirements for security, confidentiality, privacy, traceability of access,
  reversibility of data, and long-term preservation. As hospitals and health systems
  race to quickly test and decide on ideas and applications that include everything
  from patient health applications to AI, they need a HIPAA compliant cloud hosting
  platform to build or test those applications upon. Datica leads the industry with
  the first, most complete HIPAA compliant cloud infrastructure. [Datica Compliant
  Cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/) is HITRUST CSF Certified on AWS, Microsoft
  Azure, IBM SoftLayer, and Rackspace, achieving the highest industry privacy and
  security standards across infrastructure providers.\n\n## Cloud Computing Benefits
  Healthcare\nThe challenges healthcare enterprises face persist and the benefits
  of cloud computing to help them face these challenges are too compelling to ignore.
  Cloud computing allows healthcare enterprises to access improved technology at lower
  initial capital expenditures than physical environments. As healthcare organizations
  enter the race to migrate to the cloud, the barriers for innovation and modernization
  become lower, information sharing becomes possible, and the value-based transformation
  can actually take place.\n"

  :summary: HHS released its official Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing last month.
    The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask.
  :blog_lead: |-
    HHS released it's official [Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud Computing][1] last month. The guidance answers some lingering questions that people seem to ask. In some ways, it's HHS playing catchup to the industry. The cloud, while still early in terms of adoption in healthcare, is already heavily used for creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting ePHI. Look no further than [athenahealth][2], one of the largest EHR providers, for an example of a lot of ePHI in the cloud. Storing or moving data around different cloud-based services is becoming more and more commonplace.

    > A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity. - Dalai Lama

    Personally, I think HHS could and should play a more active and significant role in trends like cloud computing. I acknowledge it's hard to keep up with pace of technology in healthcare but there's still more HHS could do to engage with those leading these technical charges. That said, it's good to have official guidance from HHS.

    Yesterday I jointly conducted a webinar with [Coalfire][3]. Today I will recap some of the highlights, and pull out the salient points from the guidance and summarized them below. (_Note: CSP stands for cloud service provider._)

    * **Lacking encryption keys doesn't prevent you from being liable under HIPAA.** From the guidance, _This is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules._ This has been a claim by some CSPs and this is one of the most clear and relevant aspects of the HHS guidance. The claim by some CSPs is that, by not having the keys to decrypt ePHI, they are not a subcontractor or business associate. HHS says they are because they still store receive and maintain, even if that ePHI is encrypted and the CSP does not have the key to decrypt it. CSPs that fall into this bucket at considered _no-view services_ by HSS.
    * **But lacking keys does change obligations.** From the guidance, _In particular, where only the customer controls who is able to view the ePHI maintained by the CSP, certain access controls, such as authentication or unique user identification, may be the responsibility of the customer, while others, such as encryption, may be the responsibility of the CSP business associate._ This is the first I've seen HHS acknowledge—implicitly, at least—the concept of compliance inheritance for HIPAA. At Datica, we [pioneered][4] the concept of inheritance and still feel strongly that compliance inheritance is the best path to securing data, reducing risk of breach, and complying with HIPAA, in a cloud-based world.
    * **Lacking keys it could change breach reporting.** From the guidance, _If the ePHI that has been breached is encrypted consistent with the HIPAA standards set forth in 45 CFR § 164.402(2) and HHS' Guidance [13](#) the incident falls within the breach "safe harbor" and the CSP business associate is not required to report the incident to its customer._ This is significant as it changes breach reporting requirements for no-view CSPs, and breach reporting is a big part of HIPAA and a big part of what covered entities want to understand about their business associates and partners.
    * **All types of cloud configurations are ok for HIPAA.** From the guidance, _…while a covered entity or business associate may use cloud-based services of any configuration (public, hybrid, private, etc.), [3](#) provided it enters into a BAA with the CSP, the type of cloud configuration to be used may affect the risk analysis and risk management plans of all parties and the resultant provisions of the BAA._ NIST [defines][5] different cloud deployment models. The most common are public and private, or some mix of those two that NIST defines as hybrid. Organizations can comply with HIPAA using any deployment model but there are different risks associated with each and it is the job of the covered entity and business associate to properly assess the risk when selecting the proper deployment model. I would have preferred HHS go further and call out [single-tenant and multi-tenant in regards to HIPAA and cloud][6].
    * **SLAs need to align with BAAs.** From the guidance, _If a covered entity or business associate enters into a SLA with a CSP, it should ensure that the terms of the SLA are consistent with the BAA and the HIPAA Rules._ This is something that many business associates don't do but should. The core of this guidance is that the SLA from a CSP should ensure that access to ePHI is not restricted due to excessive downtime.
    * **Security and breach reporting should be very specifically defined.** From the guidance, _The Security Rule, however, is flexible and does not prescribe the level of detail, frequency, or format of reports of security incidents, which may be worked out between the parties to the business associate agreement (BAA)._ With ePHI moving between CSPs (think APIs and [Blank-as-a-Service][7]), it's imperative that each party knows what it is responsible for reporting. Reporting is essential to investigating and shutting off breaches.
    * **Cloud service providers do not need to store ePHI for some period of time.** From the guidance, _No, the HIPAA Rules generally do not require a business associate to maintain electronic protected health information (ePHI) beyond the time it provides services to a covered entity or business associate._ This [not news][8] to us but it something that is frequently misunderstood about HIPAA so it's good that HHS called this out for CSPs.
    * **It's ok to use servers outside the USA.** From the guidance, _Yes, provided the covered entity (or business associate) enters into a business associate agreement (BAA) with the CSP and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules._ This surprised me a little. Not because I don't agree with HHS but because I have a hard time imagining the use case for this. We have global customers, particularly in the life sciences arena, who need global deployments. In those cases, we deploy separate apps and databases across different regions depending on where end users reside. All customers we have that work with US citizens are deployed in US data centers.
    * **Documentation of security practices is not required from cloud service providers.** From the guidance, _The HIPAA Rules do not expressly require that a CSP provide documentation of its security practices to or otherwise allow a customer to audit its security practices._ This type of documentation, while not required, may still be needed by covered entities and business associates based on the their determination of risk.

    ## What was not in the guidance?

    I think a few things were missing and that HHS didn't go far enough.

    1. **Define compliance inheritance.** I think HHS could go further here. HITRUST is a [good example][9] by incorporating the concept of inheritance into the CSF. Inheriting aspects of HIPAA is a core part of cloud deployments and should be addressed by HHS.
    2. **Address questions about multi-tenancy.** This is probably the most frequent question when it comes to ePHI + cloud. It would have been good to have official guidance as a part of the cloud guidance from HHS.
    3. **Start moving towards a universal, readable BAA.** The BAA [template][10] that HSS has on it's site, while useful in its generalizability, is too broad. There are things we know about the cloud and one of them, related to inheritance above, is that different parties can own different obligations. Creating a universal BAA, even if HHS is just the convener of industry leaders, would go a long way to helping healthcare move to the cloud in a safe way.

    Healthcare, and it's data and applications, are slowly but surely embracing the cloud. The recent guidance from HHS has gotten a lot of attention. Hopefully this summary was helpful. If you have any other questions, reach out to us at [hello@datica.com][11].

  :summary: 'For the first time in twenty years, hospitals, vendors, and even payers
    and life sciences providers agree on something: FHIR is the way forward.'
  :blog_lead: The hype about [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://datica.com/blog/fhir-is-no-longer-just-a-concept/)
    has spread like, well, wildfire. The healthcare industry is often targeted by
    new, sexy technologies that sound great on the surface but often have few practical
    implementations. FHIR is NOT one of those technologies. In fact, FHIR has many
    practical use cases and benefits. More importantly, for the first time in twenty
    years, healthcare organizations, vendors, and even payers and life sciences providers
    agree this is the path forward for modern integration. This prevalent support
    is speeding FHIR’s adoption and feedback loop on improvement. Datica’s newest

    takes a candid look at the factors fueling open-data transformation at hospitals
    and health systems. Here are a few highlights from the guide.
  :post: "\n## EHR’s aren’t cutting it. \n\nHospitals, in particular, are looking
    for technology solutions that are complementary to their EHRs. EHR vendors have
    accomplished what they set out to do – digitize paper health records in order
    to improve accessibility of information. Patients’ healthcare data is now centrally
    stored and can be viewed across disciplines within an organization. Those EHR
    implementations laid the information technology groundwork that would become the
    fabric of a healthcare transformation movement. As Datica’s co-founder Travis
    Good wrote in a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/\n),
    the EHR and data consolidation are just the foundation for organizational transformation.
    \n\nToday, hospital CIOs and CMIOs are feeling pressured to improve interoperability
    with other organizations, eliminate data blocking, and embrace value-based care.
    And, as they realize the limitations of EHRs, they are increasingly looking for
    solutions from workflow-specific vendors that solve needs their EHR vendors do
    not, reach different markets than their EHR vendors, and more rapidly deploy new
    solutions than the EHRs’ on-premise architecture allows.  \n\nThe key to unlocking
    this organizational transformation is making the data in the EHR accessible. The
    industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason that being able to
    access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation tools to
    innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR, and a single
    implementation of the standard [in a centralized data hub](https://datica.com/managed-integration/)
    is the most efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility. \n\n\n## Patients
    expect transparency.\n\nPatients aren’t as captive of an audience as they once
    were. They expect connectivity and transparency in their healthcare experience
    because of their experience in other industries. \n\nIt’s easy to forget that
    patients are consumers in every other area of their lives. The [consumerization](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization)
    of the retail, travel, banking – and almost every industry except healthcare –
    has changed patient expectations. Consider what [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2017/03/14/banks-the-department-stores-of-finance/#27a5be8c6958)
    did to eliminate the complexity and the burden to the consumer when securing a
    mortgage. Now, getting a mortgage is self-service, pre-approval comes in minutes,
    and clear, transparent information is provided. \n\nThis type of innovation is
    what people have come to expect and want from everything – even healthcare.\n\n\n##
    Government mandates aren’t the reason for the revolution.\n\nCertainly, APIs are
    going to be required under legislation to increase third-party access to data.
    \ We’ve seen references to API in [Meaningful Use](https://datica.com/blog/false-claims-meaningful-use-and-hipaa-compliance-what-s-the-connection/),
    [MIPS/MACRA](https://datica.com/academy/macra-and-mips-explanation/), and [21st
    Century Cures legislation](https://datica.com/blog/21st-century-cures-act-passes-in-the-house-of-representatives/).
    The United States government typically targets strategies that are working well
    in leading organizations and then incentivizes or penalizes the rest of the healthcare
    providers to play catch up. Good examples to illustrate this point are e-prescribing
    and PQRS and/or Meaningful Use. Even so, government mandates are not the impetus
    for technology revolutions in healthcare. \n\nSo why are the frontrunners focused
    on API adoption? What are they hoping to gain in terms of health system operations
    and culture?\n \nWe invite you to download Datica’s newest guide, [What Health
    Systems can Gain from FHIR Adoption](https://datica.com/guide/fhir-for-health-systems/),
    to get the answers to these big questions. The guide unveils what FHIR enables
    in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\n"

  :summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive
    suite. Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health
    Resources.
  :blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
    but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
    from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the
    Chief Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description
    that's evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
  :post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All
    the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things
    that the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017,
    healthcare organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies
    around MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about
    [the evolving role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical
    Information Officer, and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas
    Health Resources, one of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery
    systems in the United States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt
    Texas Health Resources (THR), the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason
    many hospitals added a CMIO in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide
    push toward electronic health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation
    project was a huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction
    rating and its [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was
    the initial reason the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve
    the job definition of a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes
    far beyond EHR. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians,
    are things that the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:**
    Listen to the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the
    CMIO job is like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources
    has implemented the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved
    past stabilization, through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into
    the thick of the volume-based to value-based care transformation broadly taking
    place today. The CMIO's role is shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe
    roadmap going forward is driven by three major things: healthcare regulation,
    defining success as a healthcare organization, and effectively engaging physicians
    in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization is about improving the workflows,\"
    Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling up your sleeves and digging into specific
    and individual workflows and really optimizing those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively,
    THR has found the need to continually engage physicians in the optimization process.
    \"That entails workflow mapping and going back and redesigning care or redesigning
    the workflow, then doing some usability testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing
    that again. In fact, optimization is always a reimplementation of certain workflows,
    so you are just digging in a little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes
    a village\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability
    to collaborate with many different people, both inside and outside the organization.
    Dr. Saldana relies on a network of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how
    others solve similar problems. \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS,
    CHIME, or other forums to really connect with the people that I know are leaders
    in different areas.\" He also relies on industry organizations, like the American
    Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]), to get ideas and answers. I think
    it is important for a CMIO to get out there and not just stay cloistered within
    healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana added.\n\n## Bringing 2017
    into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in healthcare today and CMIOs
    are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for some of the newer technologies
    around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled payments and new digital health
    solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the platform that engages our patients
    and our providers and delivers the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal,\"
    said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about
    as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as they did with Meaningful Use, THR is
    planning to create a steering committee with multi-area representatives from both
    the technology and clinical sides of the fence. Dr. Saldana has this to say about
    MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for [MACRA][7].
    It's going to be how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.\"\n*
    **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare organizations today, minimizing
    risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New EMR workflows for patient
    engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary to provide patients
    with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part of improving value
    is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr. Saldana said, \"The
    point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can have an impact. Ordering
    for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will be critical for us
    as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n* **Investigating
    cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is looking into are
    in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n##
    Staying focused through it all – putting physicians first\n\nAfter spending thirty
    years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves as a representative voice
    of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency physicians get into informatics
    since there are a lot of parallels with emergency medicine and informatics in
    terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be avoided by having someone
    like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians. Dr. Saldana says a big
    part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the eyes of a physician,
    looking specifically at whether or not that new technology will make them more
    efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness to take on the
    burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the bridge between
    the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that
    we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.
    Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important for a CMIO.
    Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for an
    organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores innovation

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
