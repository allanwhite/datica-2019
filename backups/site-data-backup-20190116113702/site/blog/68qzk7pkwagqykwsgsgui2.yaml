:summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive suite.
  Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health Resources.
:blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
  but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
  from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the Chief
  Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description that's
  evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
:post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All the
  systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things that
  the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017, healthcare
  organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies around
  MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about [the evolving
  role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer,
  and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas Health Resources, one
  of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery systems in the United
  States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt Texas Health Resources (THR),
  the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason many hospitals added a CMIO
  in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide push toward electronic
  health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation project was a
  huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction rating and its
  [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was the initial reason
  the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve the job definition of
  a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes far beyond EHR. All the
  systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things that
  the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:** Listen to
  the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the CMIO job is
  like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources has implemented
  the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved past stabilization,
  through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into the thick of the volume-based
  to value-based care transformation broadly taking place today. The CMIO's role is
  shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe roadmap going forward is driven
  by three major things: healthcare regulation, defining success as a healthcare organization,
  and effectively engaging physicians in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization
  is about improving the workflows,\" Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling
  up your sleeves and digging into specific and individual workflows and really optimizing
  those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively, THR has found the need to continually engage
  physicians in the optimization process. \"That entails workflow mapping and going
  back and redesigning care or redesigning the workflow, then doing some usability
  testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing that again. In fact, optimization
  is always a reimplementation of certain workflows, so you are just digging in a
  little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes a village\n\nOne of the key
  characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability to collaborate with many different
  people, both inside and outside the organization. Dr. Saldana relies on a network
  of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how others solve similar problems.
  \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS, CHIME, or other forums to really
  connect with the people that I know are leaders in different areas.\" He also relies
  on industry organizations, like the American Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]),
  to get ideas and answers. I think it is important for a CMIO to get out there and
  not just stay cloistered within healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana
  added.\n\n## Bringing 2017 into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in
  healthcare today and CMIOs are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for
  some of the newer technologies around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled
  payments and new digital health solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the
  platform that engages our patients and our providers and delivers the best care
  for them, that's the ultimate goal,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the
  key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as
  they did with Meaningful Use, THR is planning to create a steering committee with
  multi-area representatives from both the technology and clinical sides of the fence.
  Dr. Saldana has this to say about MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you
  will be well prepared for [MACRA][7]. It's going to be how you organize as to whether
  you are successful or not.\"\n* **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare
  organizations today, minimizing risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New
  EMR workflows for patient engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary
  to provide patients with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part
  of improving value is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr.
  Saldana said, \"The point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can
  have an impact. Ordering for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will
  be critical for us as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n*
  **Investigating cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is
  looking into are in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence,
  and machine learning.\n\n## Staying focused through it all – putting physicians
  first\n\nAfter spending thirty years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves
  as a representative voice of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency
  physicians get into informatics since there are a lot of parallels with emergency
  medicine and informatics in terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be
  avoided by having someone like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians.
  Dr. Saldana says a big part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the
  eyes of a physician, looking specifically at whether or not that new technology
  will make them more efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness
  to take on the burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the
  bridge between the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we
  see now is that we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously
  disconcerting. Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important
  for a CMIO. Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is
  good for an organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores

    **On the CMIO role at Texas Health Resources (THR):** “While [the] EHR platform was our initial impetus for hiring a CMIO, we've seen that with digitalization of healthcare that it goes far beyond that. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians are all things that our Chief Medical Information Officer can have influence over.”

    **On gauging physician satisfaction with the EHR:**  “One of the reasons we were successful is that we went into our electronic health record journey and were thorough about measurement. With that, one of those metrics included physician satisfaction, so annually we survey our physicians, and survey them around satisfaction with informatics.”

    **On optimizing the EHR:** “When we started we didn't fully enable the system for its full impact and functionality. We often have to go back to do that and work closely with our vendor and with other organizations to say: How did you do this? I think we don't have the best answers on all of the optimization, but we have a wealth of connections and a lot of folks that have done good things in different areas.”

    **On how THR approaches MACRA and MIPS:**  “We treat this much like we treated Meaningful Use in terms of looking at it as “this is a quality program.” It needs to have multi area representation. It's not all technology; it's not all clinical. It really involves collaboration, so for that, we put together a steering team and we will probably do the exact same thing for MACRA, as well.”
    “A big part of this is if you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for MACRA. It's [determined by] how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.”

    **On whether the CMIO role is more clinical or technical:**  “I'd say it is bridge between the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.”

    **On the CMIO role as a gatekeeper:** “I think there are a million great ideas for technologies but we have to look at it and say, ‘How are our clinicians going to use this technology? Is this something that is going to make them more effective, efficient? Or, is it something that they're going to have to deal with a tremendous amount of change and that's just going to overburden them and we don't need to go there at this point.’”

    “They may not have the change readiness to take that on. It may be a great idea, a great technology; that's important. Having the organizational, clinical barometer is important for a CMIO. Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for our organization or not, in terms of technologies.”

    **On the top 2017 priorities for the CMIO role:** “If we are successful at doing the things in terms of creating the platform that engages our patients and our providers, and deliver the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal.”

  :summary: 'Dr. Chasin is Vice President & Chief Information Officer of St. Luke''s
    Health System in Boise, Idaho. He joined Travis to talk about where patients fit

    Dr. Chasin gave in our inaugural interview.'
  :key_takeaways: |
    1. Data ownership is changing from physicians to patients. They expect to own their data, and the data should follow them everywhere.
    2. For every 100 fantastic ideas presented to St. Luke's, 99 will likely fail at scaling for physicians, patients, or both. And that's ok: we must be comfortable with failure to find the successful innovations that will scale.
    3. If you want to introduce innovation to healthcare as a vendor, appeal to the reason the health system exists in the first place—to treat patients. Then, show how you can impact both value _and_ volume. Know the business model and outcomes. "I'm looking for partners," said Dr. Chasin.

    **Catalyze:** Thank you Dr. Chasin for joining us today. I know how busy CIOs and CMIOs are, so I can only imagine how busy one who carries both titles is. We greatly appreciate your time to talk with us today.

    **Dr. Chasin:** Thanks for having me.

    _We learned a thing or two about Google Hangouts—you'll notice Travis is focused for Dr. Chasin's first answer. We're sorry about that.  —Ed._

    **Catalyze:** It's the end of 2014. Looking to 2015, I’m curious about your biggest innovation challenge for the next year?

    **Dr. Chasin:** The biggest innovation challenge we foresee is, as healthcare is changing from volume to value, engaging our patients more on their terms. Our teams are working on determining where patients want to seek care, and where they are able to seek care. As you know, healthcare in the current financial model is unsustainable. We now need to start treating patients before they are our patients as opposed to once they do have a chronic illness. What I'm working on with our operations team is how information technology can enable our business partners to drive care into every avenue not traditionally accessed in school or your workplace or even at your home.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/7vd1zrprpx" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** I assume you are seeing that volume to value shift?

    **Dr. Chasin:** Yes, we do see that happening more swiftly over the next two years. What we do face is a tribe; there’s _people, process and technology_ to everything we approach, and most of the time technology is already present. We have a people and process issue to change the culture of our clinicians and providers, as well as the culture of how patients traditionally access care – allowing them to access it more in their own terms and in their own way, and be an active consumer and participant in the care that they receive.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1rwgkvor0k" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** Focusing specifically on the patient side, how do you go about working with patients to better understand their preferences for places that they obtain care? How do you leverage technology and tools to help make patients more informed healthcare consumers and shared decision makers in the process?

    **Dr. Chasin:** We're quickly finding out there is an active transformation happening in the environment. Patients have become more educated and understand more of what is available as technologies have become less expensive and more powerful. What we've typically seen is that over the past decade care has been provider-centric. [We’ve heard words such as:] "You have to come to my office." "You have to participate in my charted area." What we are starting to see is that the patient is starting to take ownership and "this is the clinician’s privilege to participant in the development of my record." "I want my data and my information to travel with me where I go."

    I do see a pull on each end, a transformation in the way the typical physician is engaging their patients and realizing that the physicians themselves cannot treat all the patients they need to. The physicians' culture is starting to be more team-based, and using more extenders, health coaches, wound care nurses, and others, so they can treat these volumes of patients.

    On the flip side, the patient is learning things they weren't aware of because the current health system is very difficult to navigate. It's hard to navigate even as a physician when you have to access care for your family or yourself, let alone someone that does not have any clinical background. We are educating the patients on how to navigate this system, and now they are realizing that we have a lot of redundancies and we are asking a lot of the same questions. "Why can't this be centralized?"

    We are educating patients and our clinicians together and I see there will be a symbiotic relationship coming in which we will return to the old gratification as to why physicians went into the field in the first place. They'll see that the patients really have a partner and they'll take ownership in the health of themselves and their families.

    **Catalyze:** It's interesting. My wife and I are both physicians and accessing care is incredibly challenging.

    **Dr. Chasin:** My wife is a physician as well, and when we want to see the pediatrician we have to cut out a entire half day of work. Why can't we just take a picture of the red ear because we know that it's red and have them prescribe something without us taking a half-day off of work?

    **Catalyze:** It's amazing when you look at it from the outside—or the other side I should say, it's not the outside. It's interesting to hear you say that because I think that a lot more systems need to take that approach of thinking through what it's like to be on the other side of a healthcare transaction.

    **Catalyze:** To your point about patients wanting to own their record: You participate in the Idaho Health Data Exchange. What is St. Luke's approach as far as exchanging data with other provider networks and other provider systems? How do you guys approach exchanging data?

    **Dr. Chasin:** First off we believe as St. Luke's, and I've come with the same vision, that the data needs to follow the patient wherever he or she goes. In order to make the best diagnosis, give the best care, and have the best outcome, the clinician needs to have the most up-to-date information at the tip of their fingers no matter what venue they receive care. If we go big on that preference, if we think of the patient first, and what the patient and clinician need in order to make a timely diagnosis, everything else seems to fall into place. So we foster open sharing.

    We know there is an interoperability problem in the country and that goes to my participation on the Idaho Health Data Exchange and the Care Equality Trust Framework. Right now we have to engage each and every provider on separate agreements on how the data is going to be shared, how it will be protected and the assurances.

    What we'd like to do is have one standardized trust and query framework, so that, if you adopted these, I could connect with you in a matter of hours and I'd know how you're going to use these and know how you are going to protect it. Right now I have point agreements with 40-50 different exchange partners. I believe in a rural state the sharing of that may be of higher importance. I get patients from very rural areas, from physicians that practice within their own community and don't see patients anywhere else as opposed to the large metropolitan area that needs to see what the EKG was last year, or the chest Xray that was done.

    We handle as best we can right now with those point agreements, but we fully believe that if we are going to have to care for the community, and we are going to have multiple providers in the community, that are all aligned with the mission and values of our organization. The fact of the matter is that we should all be able to align around the vision of treating the patient with the highest amount of acuity and best diagnostic ability that relies on the right data, at the right time, to the right clinician to make those diagnoses.

    **Catalyze:** When you look at a unified or standard trust framework or protocol framework that you mentioned, are there some emerging open sourced standards, or emerging things that you are seeing from certain vendors?

    **Dr. Chasin:** There's a lot of talk in the environment and the industry about what you would call the "walled gates" of each EHR vendor and how they share equivalents with each other. But once it goes across those boundaries, it gets a little bit kludgy and mucks up the waters. There are a lot of organizations that are realizing the need to exchange data, like providers and doctor's practices. They are making the call to the vendors to start to break those walls.

    At St. Luke's we have multiple vendors we engage to build integrations or to build the exchange of continuity of documents. We are having an enormous amount of problems with that. There are five or six organizations that have popped up that are trying to solve this one problem. One of them is Care Equality. Care Equality is developing a vendor agnostic approach to connectivity. It has all the vendors on the panels, as well as the government to figure out a way that we can break this inability to connect and improve interoperability. There's HL7 that has come together at Care Equality. There's CommonWell – all have this intent and I think that we'll start to come together and break down those walls so that any vendor can connect with another vendor to benefit all patient care.

    **Catalyze:** We hear from both enterprises and really big vendors in the space that people are very excited about FHIR and HL7. Looking at that, do you see it as promising in the next three years as an emerging standard for change?

    **Dr. Chasin:** It is and every interoperability consortium I've been a part of has referenced that document and the group that has developed it. I do see the industry leveraging the good work that has been done already and trying to refine it so it can be scaled.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/w4adxidrbi" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** As you focus on patients and clinicians and what's going to fit in this new paradigm of care, are there certain criteria or things that you use from a big health system perspective to evaluate how technologies are going to fit within your organization?

    **Dr. Chasin:** Ultimately our business is treating patients, but we are not going to succeed unless we do fail.

    Some clinicians and some technologies are really good in proof of concepts and we entertain any new innovative idea or new technology. We do an ROI on it. We do a proof of concept on it. We try to deploy it in a small test of change.

    For every 100 fantastic ideas we have, 99 just don't really scale and either don't benefit the patient from an access perspective, or the clinician from an efficiency perspective. We weigh those by getting the clinicians and traditional health system or hospital operators in the room, as well as conduct patient panels and forums, because many of our employees are also patients of our health system. We have a captive audience that want the best for their families. We go through a rigor of many tests of change and escalating it between specialty and primary care to outpatient departments before we get a technology and fully cascade it throughout our entire system.

    **Catalyze:** Is that the same process for when you evaluate both internal and external products and service technologies?

    **Dr. Chasin:** We do it for both because we have a lot of independent providers and patients that want to see capabilities or functionality in our current offerings. We have to make sure that whatever we offer doesn't deter from the overall experience that we want our patients to have when they engage with our technology and our system.

    When we develop a technology or a piece of technology just for a subset of our patient population, we ask _Is that going to deter from the overall experience?_

    What we would like to do in our area is be the hub of healthcare information, of our patient community, so that they think of us first, because we want to develop that same patient experience and ease of access of data to the patient and their care. We put that through just as much rigor as when we develop an internal technology.

    For example an ERP system that no patient will see as opposed to to our patient portal where we have about 105,000 patients accessing and making sure that their experience is just as solid as the front line person accessing our ERP system.

    **Catalyze:** It's encouraging to hear someone in your position talk about patient experience and focusing on patient feedback when evaluating new services and technology. For a long time in healthcare there was not that focus. For a long time health systems acted like the airlines do now.

    <iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/pb9u2rcrao" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="500" height="312"></iframe>

    **Catalyze:** If you were talking to vendors, what type of advice would you give them for approaching a health system like St. Luke's for a pilot?

    **Dr. Chasin:** There are a couple of approaches, and I've thought about this for a little bit.

    Appeal to the reason the health system exists in the first place. The health system exists to treat patients and to treat them well, because that will sustain their mission and their vision.

    Secondly, the healthcare environment has changed. Tell me how I'm going to improve the health of my community without seeing those patients. We function in the volume and the value model at the same time. We are essentially cannibalizing our business model at the same time. If we deploy a technology that is going to improve the outcomes of our patients and they don't have to come in and see us in the office, then our revenue is going to change. But we all know where it is going. We just have to tiptoe through this and get through this box of two business models.

    I've seen some amazing new technologies, but there is no hard ROI on how we are going to get through to that new business model. Looking at those technologies to see how you are going to keep me in the volume world with patients coming in, but will also allow me to be held to the value world and to push your technology out into the patient's hand. I would look at the business model. I would come to me and talk to me with both how you can help me with revenue today, and how you can help me with outcomes in three to four years.

    I'm looking for a partner that is going to be with me through the thick and thin as I transform my business and is going to work with me and the technology to accommodate what I need to do to achieve the end goal which is treating an entire population of patients where they want to receive care and how they want to receive care.

    **Catalyze:** How do you empower that organization-wide innovation when you have a health system as spread out as yours? How do you encourage that innovative culture across all of the organization?

    **Dr. Chasin:** The way I approach this is whether you are an end-user, using the technology and seeing the patients with it, or you are one that supports it, you have to feel that you are safe to fail. It's okay to fail and it's okay to try something new.

    I try to produce an environment that puts the appropriate white lines on the road so you can't damage someone else's practice while they innovate and see their patients and then we do breakouts. If there's an innovation, I want to hear about it and understand what they are doing. I gather my team together and we look at that and if it is viable, we vet it around and cascade it throughout the entire organization. The key to getting that done is the environment and the feeling of safety that it is okay to fail if you do. You are not going to get innovation if there is fear of retribution. That's how we've done it.

    We still have pockets that are growing, but we do have some amazing things that have been done from an innovative perspective, allowing the clinician the freedom to fail and learn new ways and learn how to adopt new technologies.

    **Catalyze:** This has been a wonderful discussion. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us today.

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
