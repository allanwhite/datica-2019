:summary: Apple's ResearchKit represents the first time a significant player in the
  consumer ecosystem has stepped into the esoteric world of clinical research.
:blog_lead: |
  Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/03/09Apple-Introduces-ResearchKit-Giving-Medical-Researchers-the-Tools-to-Revolutionize-Medical-Studies.html) ResearchKit on March 9. Since then, there has been a flurry of blog posts and discussions around its value and impact. I'll go into more detail on that below but the main thing is that this is the first time a **significant** player in the consumer ecosystem has stepped into the esoteric world of clinical research. The product being offered does have limitations around code, technology and liability—all of which can be addressed. That Apple is willing to step up and help improve medical research, an area desperately in need of change, is heartening and will, I'm willing to bet, cause Google and others to step up as well.

:post: "\nThe purpose of this article for is to provide a better, and perhaps more
  nuanced, understanding of:\n\n1. The world of clinical studies;\n2. Which *types*
  of clinical studies ResearchKit in conjunction with HealthKit might be best suited
  for initially; and\n3. What the future of clinical studies (no matter the type)
  could look like with ResearchKit and similar solutions from other providers.\n\nI
  won't cover what ResearchKit provides in detail. Although we're beginning work on
  that at Catalyze, we'll wait until Apple open sources it (another big win) before
  delving into it in more detail.\n\nSo let's jump right in...\n\n### The world of
  clinical studies\n\nThere are several *types* of clinical studies. [Clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)
  categorizes them into three buckets:\n\n- [Observational Studies](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/glossary#observational-study):
  This is the *simplest* study (this is very relative - I do not intend to imply these
  studies are trivial by any means). The goal here is to collect data on effectiveness
  / outcomes related to a particular disease, intervention (use of a drug, life style
  changes such as exercise or diet etc.) or diagnostics (choice of screening method
  - e.g. BMI vs. blood test, frequency - e.g. every three months vs. annually and
  more). Patients **do not** get allocated to different groups, each with different
  interventions. Think of this more as a data collection exercise used to generate
  hypotheses which can be further tested and verified with stronger evidence. Which
  bring us to...\n- [Interventional Studies (or Clinical Trials)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/glossary#interventional-study):
  These are the clinical trials we've all heard about lasting multiple years, costing
  billions of dollars and driving up the cost of brand name drugs. It's an intensive
  process with significant oversight and regulation (to ensure data is not massaged
  or faked, which falls under CFR 21 - Part 11) across multiple phases (to evaluate
  impact of dosage levels - Phase 1, to evaluate impact of various dosage levels -
  Phase II etc.). This is a much more rigorous study intended to gather statistical
  **evidence** (double blind studies, placebos,  etc.) *proving* that a particular
  interventional does / will have a statistically significant impact on outcomes.\n-
  [Expanded Access](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/glossary#expanded-access):
  If patients have a serious life-threatening disease and there is an insufficiently
  large pool of patients to do a full fledged interventional clinical trial with all
  the associated A/B testing, placebo etc., patients can be enrolled in expanded access
  trials. This is heavily overseen and regulated by the FDA for obvious reasons.\n\nThat's
  a high level introduction to the different types of clinical studies and their relative
  effort. Based upon this information, you can draw an obvious conclusion that, for
  the immediate term, observational studies are the easiest area of ResearchKit applicability.
  The more data a researcher has, the better the likelihood a hypothesis is based
  on fact rather than gut. That is critical because, as mentioned earlier, the other
  two types of studies can get pretty expensive. I'll focus the rest of this post
  on observational studies and how Apple's ResearchKit and HealthKit can help.\n\nLet's
  talk a bit about the challenges in the observational studies space (some of these
  will apply to all types of studies as well).\n\n### Challenges\n\n#### Recruitment\n\n>
  \"Join the army\" they said, \"it'll be FUN\" they said.\n> — Engineers, Company
  of Heroes\n\nRecruitment is **THE** major bane of all clinical studies. Observational
  studies, specifically in cases when the intervention is a drug, rely on the fact
  that earlier interventional studies have already happened. How do people report
  unexpected adverse reactions? Turns out that an adverse event is [defined by the
  FDA](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=314.80)
  as any undesirable experience that can be associated with the use of a medical product
  in a patient. It can be anything from the product not working as intended to causing
  a serious, life-threatening reaction, or even death. That's a pretty broad range,
  and one aspect of patient self reporting which we all hear about.\n\nThe other aspect
  is reporting on outcomes. What is the impact of taking a particular medication vs
  others for the same condition, what is the impact of this amount of dosage vs. others?
  The more available data points, the more considered the hypothesis. And that is
  where HealthKit can play a significant role. Within a few hours of ResearchKit being
  announced, [multiple apps](http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/health-care/2015/03/mgh-uses-apple-research-kit-to-redefine-research.html)
  reported thousands of sign ups, which has it's pros and cons:\n\n#### Pros\n\n\t-
  *Easy to sign up*: [Thousands of people](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/11/researchkit-thousands-sign-up/)
  signed up within 24 hours of the announcement. Amazing. As a researcher notes in
  the [this](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/apple-researchkit-sees-thousands-sign-up-amid-bias-criticism)
  article, and I quote, \"To get 10, 000 people enrolled in a medical study normally,
  it would take a year and 50 medical centers around the country...\". That is astounding.\n\t-
  Anyone with an iPhone can now join\n\t- Some aspects of data gathering can be done
  passively (more in the next section)\n\t- All aspects of permissions are taken care
  of in-app\n\t- Various kinds of data gathering: voice, gait, entry etc. can all
  be addressed\n\n#### Cons\n\n\t- *Verification & Matching*: Also a pro, anyone can
  sign up.  This ties to the aspect of data quality and reliability. Verification
  will remain an issue unless addressed explicitly. Lisa Schwartz, professor at the
  Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, notes in the same Fortune
  article referenced earlier, \"Just collecting lots of information about people—who
  may or may not have a particular disease, and may or may not represent the typical
  patient—could just add noise and distraction.\"\n\t- *Selection bias*: The simplest
  bias is only iPhone users can participate, which is not a broad enough sample. But
  that's addressable as soon as the rest jump on the bandwagon and Apple open sources
  ResearchKit. For a more in depth chat about biases, see [this](https://statsdoc.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/apples-researchkit-is-not-yet-ready-for-primetime-a-medical-researchers-perspective/)
  post from someone who works in the field on a daily basis. Note that he too is optimistic
  about the opportunity.\n\n#### Gathering data\n\n> \"Human beings were not meant
  to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless
  forms...\"\n> — Peter Gibbons, Office Space\n\nAt the core of it all, this is the
  rationale and enabler behind the quantified self movement. Capturing data cannot
  always be an active effort on the part of the patient. A significant amount of the
  data capture needs to be passive, or at least easy, to gather. Traditionally, the
  only way to capture this kind of data was to ask the patient to fill out lengthy
  forms weekly or as frequently as possible. The irony is if it is difficult enough
  for a physician to get a patient to adhere to medication prescriptions, what hope
  does a researcher have to ask patients to fill out a form regularly about the effects
  of that prescription?\n\nAnd that is the second biggest innovation. The combination
  of HealthKit, Core Motion and ResearchKit make it possible to come up with innovations
  such as the [Parkinson's mPower app](http://parkinsonmpower.org/) which enables
  \"innovative activity-based measurements of Parkinson symptoms that include a memory
  game, finger tapping, voice recording, and walking\". There's more to come as developers
  dream up ways to combine the three solutions into a seamless patient experience.\n\nIt
  is worthwhile to note that two of the three (apart from ResearchKit) have equivalents
  in the Android world as well. The selection bias problem is not a long lived one
  by any means.\n\n### The promise of Apple ResearchKit\n\n> \"Remember Red, hope
  is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\"\n> — Andy
  Dufresne, The Shawshank Redemption\n\nWhile a lot can be said about the negatives,
  or rather, the areas of improvement, ResearchKit has several things going for it,
  namely\n- Apple: Having such a large organization put its weight and product behind
  healthcare research, is a huge step forward.\n- Recruitment: See above not to mention
  the ease of use and UX that Apple demands of apps on it's AppStore.\n- Consent and
  privacy: Having this baked in from the start goes a long way in allaying fears about
  privacy and data use. It is interesting to note that one of the reasons behind the
  [initial partnership](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/20/inside-story-researchkit/)
  to develop ResearchKit was that *\"he wanted to work with them rather than competitors
  like Google and Microsoft because Apple is a hardware company that doesn't need
  to sell data, and that he believed Apple when the company said it wouldn't look
  at the data being used in ResearchKit\"*. I'm a bit of skeptic so I don't fully
  believe that but time will tell.\n- Passive data gathering: As mentioned earlier,
  the combination of HealthKit, Core Motion and ResearchKit opens up a world of possibilities.\n-
  Active data gathering: easy forms!!!! And associated workflows. While this might
  seem trivial technically, making it easy from a business and developer perspective
  as described [here](https://developer.apple.com/researchkit/researchkit-technical-overview.pdf)
  is very promising.\n- Open source: While the principles of this are not quite clear,
  it seems as though innovations around data capture can be (should / will be?) open
  sourced is again something that could force an opportunity for researchers and developers
  to collaborate with each other.\n- Significant academic institution participation:
  The starting line up includes Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer
  Institute, Penn Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Rochester, Stanford
  Medicine, UCLA Jonsson Cancer Research Center and Weill Cornell Medical College.
  That is an impressive line up.\n\n### The gaps to be addressed\n\n> \"Hmmm, upgrades\"\n>
  — Neo, The Matrix Reloaded\n\nBut—and yes, there's always a but—apart from the business
  challenges outlined above, Apple does make it very clear that there are gaps, some
  of which will be addressed by Apple, others by developers via open source contributions
  and still others that will be left up to the researchers. Namely:\n\n- Matching:
  Signups and participation is always a good thing. But as described earlier, verification
  and matching participants to match research study requirements is an open challenge.\n-
  Passive background data collection: This must be enabled via APIs like HealthKit
  and CoreMotion that already support this.\n- Security: Secure communication mechanisms
  between the app and server. This is not a significant issue. Hopefully all communication
  will be done over SSL/TLS.\n- Scheduling: The ability to schedule surveys and active
  tasks for your participants. This is not automatic but again is addressable with
  server side logic.\n- A defined data format for how ResearchKit structured data
  is serialized. Standardization around the data models will be a good thing to progress
  towards especially aligning with the HL7 and upcoming FHIR standards. This is an
  exciting area and something that we at Catalyze are working towards.\n- Automatic
  compliance with international research regulations and HIPAA guidelines. These are
  the researcher's responsibility. Not to mention CFR21 Part 11 compliance. These
  are all the aspects that Catalyze deals with on an ongoing basis across a wide variety
  of customers.\n\n### Summary\n\n> \"I think all you need is a small taste of success,
  and you will find it suits you.\"\n> — Monique, Better Off Dead.\n\nApple's announcement
  around ResearchKit has generated a lot of [buzz and excitement](http://fortune.com/2015/03/15/apples-researchkit-is-a-big-hit-at-sxsw/)
  for good reason. The combination of HealthKit, Core Motion and ResearchKit is a
  potent combination. Hopefully, since two of three already exist in the Android world,
  the third should follow quickly. Which, from a patient and researcher perspective,
  is a good thing. While there are significant positives, there still remain several
  challenges that need to be resolved but it is our firm belief at Catalyze that existing
  solutions from vendors (such as Catalyze) and other open source contributions will
  see these addressed shortly.\n\n"

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats

    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
