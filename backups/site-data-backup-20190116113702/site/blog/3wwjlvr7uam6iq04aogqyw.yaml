:blog_lead: 'HIPAA regulations outline IT compliance in high-level detail but  does
  not specify methods for true compliance. This lack of a guided approach can prove
  to be an obstacle for healthcare clinician managers seeking concrete methods to
  train personnel, especially in regards to technology.

'
:post: |+
  Fortunately, Datica is here to help you by making sure your training focuses solely on what clinicians need to know, which will save time and increase engagement. Here are the five key topics we suggest you focus on in your HIPAA training sessions:

  ## 1) Remote Access to the Electronic Health Record (EHR)

  With all of the documentation that clinicians deal with during the workdays, they could be accessing EHRs from their home to keep with their responsibilities. But if they are not properly trained on how to access these records, they could be setting your healthcare system up for a security breach. Here are a few tips:

  - Enact a two-step authentication for allowing remote access
  - Implement immediate sessions termination following a clinician signing in and being inactive for a predetermined amount of time.
  - Inaugurate personal firewall software on all laptops and machine that store protected health information or connect to networks where protected health information may be stored.
  - Place an embargo on clinicians from remotely accessing EHRs except in certain instances

  ## 2) Mobile Device Controls and Security

  Missing or stolen devices (laptops, tablets, and phones) account for the most HIPAA security breaches. If clinicians have protected health information on these devices, these devices must be encrypted, password protected, and have safeguards properly implemented. Consider having clinicians sign a mobile device security agreement to emphasize the importance of housing data on these devices.

  ## 3) Pertinent EHR Access

  Clinicians are not oblivious to the HIPAA Privacy rules and their responsibilities but part of that responsibility is that they only access patients’ information if they are directly involved in the care. Consistently stress the importance of this to ensure that staff members do not violate this rule and that they will be facing audits to ensure nothing goes askew.

  ## 4) Email and Texting Guidance

  Since email and texting are so convenient for clinicians, some may be sending protected health information through these channels without a second thought. Be sure to drive the message that sharing information through these channels should always be avoided. Be sure to provide HIPAA compliant communication tools in alternative to these, such as HIPAA compliant secure messaging through patient portals.

  ## 5) Social Media Channel Guidance

  In the modern day, most clinicians are somehow involved with at least one social media channel, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. Be sure to highlight that they should be keeping their social media pages private to avoid any requests from friends that are double as patients. Also be sure and address that clinicians need to ensure their blogging appropriately if applicable, and not as a source to provide health guidance to patients.

  All in all, HIPAA compliance training should be very thorough but still direct with your clinicians. These are points to be treated as critical training areas for your organization.

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    [BAA Isn’t a Checkbox for HIPAA Compliance](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/baa-isn-t-a-checkbox-for-hipaa-compliance/)\n\n</div>\n\nThe
    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##
    Proving HIPAA Compliance\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-left\"

    [How Long to Keep Medical Records Under HIPAA](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/blog/how-long-to-keep-medical-records-under-hipaa/)\n\n</div>\n\nAnybody
    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
