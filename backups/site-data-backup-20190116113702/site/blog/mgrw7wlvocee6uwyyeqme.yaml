:summary: 'On transformation in healthcare, Dr. Richard Milani likens healthcare systems
  to ocean liners that can’t turn on a dime. Read more about healthcare transformation. '
:blog_lead: 'Dr. Richard Milani is the Chief Clinical Transformation Officer and Vice-Chairman
  of the Department of Cardiology at Ocshner Health System, and the author of the
  soon-to-be-released book [Death and Dollars: Solving the Epidemic of Chronic Disease](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Dollars-Solving-Epidemic-Chronic/dp/1683505875).
  Dr. Milani was a guest on the [Datica Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/innovation/richard-milani-md-how-innovators-can-improve-the-clinical-experience-for-patients/)
  on January 19, 2018, and discussed the role of transformation in healthcare with
  Datica’s Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky. '
:post: "\n## The role of a chief transformation officer\n\nHealthcare, in the US and
  around the world, is undergoing enormous change — the biggest transformation since
  Hippocrates, according to Dr. Milani. \n\n> We realize and recognize that we have
  to transform ourselves in order to be more cost-effective and achieve better quality
  outcomes.” \n\nThe “sole purpose” of a transformation officer “is to be able to
  ready health systems for the needed transformation that is coming,” says Dr. Milani.
  Change is inevitable, and transformation officers are helping healthcare systems
  prepare. \n\nDr. Milani likens healthcare systems to big ships, An ocean liner can’t
  turn on a dime, and a healthcare system needs time to change how it does business.
  \n\n## Incentive is the key to transformation\n\n“Generally what drives incentive
  in our economy is where the dollars flow,” says Dr. Milani. The payment system that
  healthcare systems have used is based on volume, so that more patients meant more
  payments. \n\nThe current [transformation is from volume to value](https://datica.com/innovation/leadership-gallery/).
  Healthcare systems will be paid based on the quality of care they provide, rather
  than the number of patients they see. “So if you are doing a better job, you’ll
  get paid better than if you did a poor job,” says Milani, adding, “That means changing
  how you deliver care.” \n\nHealthcare systems that have done well with the old model
  don’t have much incentive to change, but the direction of care, in the US and the
  rest of the world, is towards value-based care. “I think that it is the best thing
  that could happen for people, because at the end of the day what you want is to
  see a physician or go to a hospital that’s going to deliver high value, high quality,
  safe care, in the most efficient way possible for you so you can get whatever you
  need done, get out safely and not have problems that occur, or repeat hospitalizations
  for whatever procedure you might have had,” says Dr. Milani. \n\n## The patient
  experience matters \n\nIn the current healthcare landscape in the US, [patients
  are consumers](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/).
  The rising costs associated with healthcare have led to more high-deductible insurance
  plans. “As a result of that out-of-pocket [cost], people are sensitive to what we
  would consider a consumer-based strategy,” says Dr. Milani. Things like wait times,
  overall treatment, and cost are becoming increasingly important. \n\n> I don’t think
  that health systems in general across the US have spent time learning what patients
  want and looking at patients as consumers of healthcare as opposed to just recipients
  of healthcare,” says Dr. Milani. \n\nRecognizing that, along with asking questions
  that lead to an understanding of what patients need and want are critical parts
  of the current transformation in healthcare.\n\n## A frictionless experience from
  vendors improves everything\n\nDr. Milani says that when tech vendors make things
  easy for the health system, the relationship is much smoother and more likely to
  succeed — and interoperability is the key to a frictionless experience. \n\n“This
  only works well if we can share information appropriately and of course, the keyword
  is interoperability,” says Dr. Milani. He notes that stakeholders are coming together
  “more collegially than in the past,” and that has demonstrated the benefits of interoperability.
  \n\nMore than just making technology easier to use, interoperability allows health
  systems to use the data in ways that make sense. \n\n> Having the information in
  one location where we can now categorize and do all kinds of things with that information
  to interact with the patient at the right moment, at the right time, and at the
  right place is critical for us.”\n\n## Ocshner is transforming chronic disease care\n\nOne
  area where the transformation in healthcare is having a fairly immediate impact
  is that of chronic care. Dr. Milani points out that 86% of all the money spent on
  healthcare in the US is spent managing chronic disease. \n\nOcshner launched a digital
  medicine program for people with hypertension two years ago and, more recently,
  one for people with diabetes. Dr. Milani says, “We can see things getting out of
  control before they get out of control and we can make adjustments on the fly.”
  \n\nIn the hypertension program, which was designed for people with uncontrolled
  high blood pressure, 71% of the participants enrolled were in control within 90
  days of being enrolled in the program. “We are much more effective in controlling
  chronic disease digitally than we are in a face-to-face, every three-to-six-month
  model that is the way we do chronic care today in the US,” says Dr. Milani. \n\n>
  It’s a much better experience; it’s a much better quality of care, it’s at a lower
  cost, and it’s also reducing the burden on the provider. It’s a great example.”

  :summary: We didn’t begin seeing the Clinical Transformation Officer role within
    healthcare in wide numbers until around 2014. Possibly this is due, in part, to
    the multi-disciplinary domain of digital health becoming widely viewed as providing
    an avenue for transforming healthcare at the same time. Today’s podcast with Ocshner’s
    Clinical Transformation Officer Dr. Richard Milani takes even those with limited
    knowledge of the role and provides context into how this role fits within the
    ecosystem of healthcare innovation. Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky,
    sat down with Dr. Milani while in New Orleans to speak at the HL7 Partners in
    Interoperability Summit, and visited with him to learn more about the innovations
    that Ocshner is delivering—and how this health system views clinical transformation.
  :key_takeaways: |-
    1. Learn what a Clinical Transformation Officer is and more on this unique role in healthcare
    2. Discover where the greatest cost of care is in the U.S. health system and how Ocshner is addressing it
    3. Get an inside view of why vendors’ pilot pitches fail and why some succeed
    4. Hear what has been added to the triple aim to bring it up to the quadruple aim
  :post: |-
    ### Dr. Milani responds:

    **On why health systems are adding Clinical Transformation Officers:** "We realize and recognize that we have to transform ourselves in order to be more cost-effective and achieve better quality outcomes — not only the U.S. but across the world.

    Their sole purpose is to be able to ready health systems for the needed transformation that is coming."

    **On value-based care:** "I think that it is the best thing that could happen for people, because at the end of the day you want to see a physician or go to a hospital that's going to deliver high value, high quality, safe care, in the most efficient way possible for you so you can get what you need done, get out safely and not have problems that occur, or repeat hospitalizations for whatever procedure you might have had."

      </a>
    </p>

    **On the largest constraints for delivery of new innovations:** "The biggest constraints are always going to be culture. We have to appeal to what is best for our customers and in this case patients are our customers; that generally helps things along. But typically the greatest difficulty you will have is culture and moving culture around.

    **On how the Ocshner innovation team works with the IT department:** "We are independent but we are close in terms of not interfering with the day-to-day job that they have to perform, which is to keep the trains running on time. They need to make sure that our EMR is up-to-date, operational, safe, effective, secure and those are critically important functions. We work side by side with them."

    **On the vendor approach that doesn’t align with a health system:** "What doesn't work is if a vendor is just purely just trying to sell their product and they are not interested ultimately in making this frictionless."

    > I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability.

    **On the state of interoperability:** "I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability. Having the information in one location where we can now categorize and do all kinds of things with that information to interact with the patient at the right moment, at the right time, and at the right place is critical for us."

    **On Ocshner’s transformation focus:** "Our mantra has always been the quadruple aim. Anything that we do from an innovation perspective tries to target at least one, if not all the principles of the quadruple aim, which is namely improving the health of the population, improving the quality of the care that we provide, reducing the costs of care for our population and finally, the fourth aim is now — how can we do this while improving the workload on the providers of care."

    **On ideas for clinicians and informaticists working at startups:** "Clearly, for any startup in the healthcare sector, it's going to be difficult for you to be able to sell whatever product you have, unless you have some real-world data and outcomes based on that data. I think it would be very important for any of these small startups to develop relationships with delivery systems to say: We've got this idea. Do you think this has legs? Not only to test it out, but to get advice and feedback. We provide counsel to a lot of small startups. Sometimes the way they imagine healthcare delivery to be is somewhat different than it really is."

  :summary: Esther Dyson, whose career includes journalist, author, businesswoman,
    commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and even backup cosmonaut, sat down
    for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD.
  :blog_lead: "This November, the [Healthcare Innovators Podcast](https://datica.com/podcast/)
    interviewed a very special industry guest. Due to audio difficulties, we chose
    to run a transcript of our fascinating conversation. \n\nEsther Dyson has worn
    many different hats during the course of her career, including journalist, author,
    businesswoman, commentator, philanthropist, angel investor, and yes, even backup
    cosmonaut. Esther sat down for an interview with Datica CEO Travis Good, MD. In
    this interview, she shared some of her thoughts around ways to increase digital
    health success, the importance of security and privacy for digital health firms,
    and gave us an update on her nonprofit initiative that selected five American
    communities to use different measures to cultivate health and invest in the value
    wellness returns. "
  :post: "> Don't be afraid to try. Work under the assumption that it will work and
    if it doesn't work, figure out why. In a startup you are doing things people have
    never done before.\" - Esther Dyson \n\n## Q & A with Travis Good and Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis
    Good, MD:** _Esther, you’ve said in the past that as an angel investor you like
    to focus your investments on disease prevention versus technology around disease
    treatment. Can you tell us a bit more about that philosophy?_\n\n**Esther Dyson:**
    In general, you get a better return on keeping things working and investing in
    capacity than you do in trying to repair things that are broken. To some extent,
    people sometimes take that for granted. They do general maintenance to their cars
    and they conduct home maintenance, but often forget when it comes to their own
    bodies. People generally don't go to the doctor until they are sick and by that
    time, it is extremely expensive to try and fix the problem. It's expensive not
    just for you, but also for the healthcare system. It’s also expensive for your
    employer and you are probably less productive there. For individual investors
    and for society in general, it makes more sense to keep us healthy. Obviously,
    a big market exists for fixing people who are broken, but given that I have limited
    resources, I'd rather try to put the people who are trying to “fix what is broken”
    out of business by keeping everybody healthy.\n\n> Let’s start with the simple
    proposition that health is an asset. It might be our most important asset. And
    like any asset, if we cultivate it we increase the value it returns. We’re not
    talking about fixes when health is broken; those are important but they happen
    too late.\n— [Way To WellVille](http://www.wellville.net/about-wellville/)\n\n**Travis:**
    _I would agree that obviously prevention is the ideal path so that makes sense
    from an investment standpoint, as well. I want to shift gears to something you
    founded in 2013. You rebranded the Health Initiative Coordinating Council (HICCup)._\n\n<img
    class=\"float-right\" title=\"Dyson - WaytoWellville-logo\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/KIxLr1iDGmiyYAi6cS4mG/d2080c6197ba94f2841c853c77015aac/Dyson_-_WaytoWellville-logo.png?w=400\"
    width=\"200\">\n\n**Esther:** In 2013, I founded Way to Wellville, which is a
    nonprofit and it does exactly what we are talking about. The investment pays off
    but the business model doesn't necessarily pay back to the investor, so that's
    why [Way to Wellville](http://hitconsultant.net/2015/02/12/esther-dysons-way-to-wellville-challenge/)
    is a nonprofit. We are trying to show the value of investing in health. Ultimately,
    governments, communities, and employers will realize there's a huge ROI. In 2014,
    we selected five communities from among 42 that applied. Now, the Wellville team
    of five are working with actual communities to help make them healthy. By the
    end of ten years, we hope to have enough success and visibility that we actually
    persuade other people to follow our path.\n\n> These are all real places with
    real people. They are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just
    places that have decided they would like a better future for their residents.
    [Wellville is] helping them build that for themselves.\n\n**Travis:** _My understanding
    is that the goal with these communities is to see which one could most improve
    five measures of health and economic vitality over a five year period. That was
    2014; we are almost in 2018 now. Could you update us on how that's going?_\n\n**Esther:**
    As I mentioned, we pivoted. It did start out as a contest, but it turned out the
    communities were not interested in beating one another, they really wanted to
    collaborate and learn from one another. It also became clear that ten years is
    a more realistic timeframe. Like any startup, we've morphed. It turns out that
    getting communities and community leader groups coordinated and organized has
    a long gestation period. It's very much like a startup; it takes a few years to
    build your team, try out an NVP, then discover that you need to change everything.
    We are now much more focused on children and parents and prevention of diabetes.
    If you can help the parents be better parents, or you change the children's experience
    positively, that's what's going to pay off best in the long run. \n\nDiscussions
    now center on [the opioid crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/truth-us-opioid-crisis-too-easy-blame-doctors-not-prescriptions);
    they keep talking about the drugs, but they should also be talking about why people
    are so vulnerable to these drugs. What makes them unable to resist? Not everybody
    who takes an opioid suddenly gets addicted, yet a number of people do and that's
    partly because their childhood was so insecure. It’s very hard if you've grown
    up not being able to trust the people around you. There's a lot of data on so-called
    adverse childhood experience that show direct correlation between that and addiction,
    unemployment, crime and all kinds of social ills. So we are trying to go upstream
    and address it from the start. \n\n**Travis:** _Are you working with the communities
    to define those measures and strategies, or are they coming to you?_\n\n**Esther:**
    We put out a call for applications in 2014. Forty-two communities applied; we
    picked five. Our role is like a personal trainer, or perhaps a startup coach.
    It's still the community that has to do the work; it’s their people; it's ultimately
    their achievement. We might eventually make ourselves unnecessary, but in the
    meantime, we can give them advice, introduce them to what the other communities
    are doing, introduce them to vendors and to potential funding sources. Way to
    Wellness was funded by me and I'd certainly love others to join, but the community
    projects are funded directly by funders, whether it is Medicaid, or philanthropy
    or a government grant; it's between those funders and the communities. It's theirs,
    not ours and we are not looking to be visible or recognized. We are looking for
    them to take on the responsibility, do the work, make a difference, train their
    own people and have something to be really proud of.\n\n**Travis:** _It's exciting
    to hear when people are working with communities, especially some small communities.
    What happens after that initial 10-year period?_\n\n**Esther:** The goal is to
    build something sustainable. Instead of, “Oh we have a class for 60 overweight
    women.” We want to hear, “We have now trained 30 dieticians and nutritional counselors,
    exercise coaches and they are community members, and they now have jobs and they
    are keeping those people healthy.”  This is the problem: Just as people get addicted
    to drugs, ironically, communities and nonprofits often get addicted to pilots.
    The pilots are great. We often hear, \"This pilot’s going to be really wonderful
    and we'll have a trial with 30 people.” The pilot works then we often hear \"We've
    run out of funding and the funders want to do something more innovative.\" We
    are not trying to do something innovative; we are trying to do something that
    works and then scale it. \n\nWhen Walmart opens a store, they are not running
    a pilot to see if the store works. If the store somehow isn't working, they find
    a new manager, they do more training, but they don't say, \"Oh, the concept of
    this really doesn't work.\" We are trying to get that kind of accountability.
    These programs work, if effective people are brought in, screened and trained.
    People need transportation, as well. There are lots of local challenges that you
    need to overcome. There's no magic here; there's simply implementation, persistence,
    and being in it for the long-term, versus \"we'll get some results and then see
    what happens.\" \n\n**Travis:** _As you were talking through that in terms of
    building something that is sustainable, real, and can scale, I imagine that's
    the same thing you would say to some of the companies that you invest in and how
    they should view pilots._\n\n**Esther:** Yes, very much. Don't be afraid to try.
    Work under the assumption that it will work and if it doesn't work, figure out
    why. In a startup you are doing things people have never done before. People have
    done diabetes prevention programs before. They have trained communities better.
    What we are not doing is coming to these communities and doing exotic research
    and turning people into specimens. We are helping them do things that typically
    don't scale. Instead of doing something that is often different, you are trying
    to do something new that hasn't been tried before and learn from failing. In our
    communities, you learn from failing. Maybe we need to train people better or maybe
    we didn't market this program effectively enough or we need to provide some type
    of incentive or we need to provide child care so that people can attend the course,
    because hey, they don't have childcare — what a surprise! It's those kinds of
    things.\n\n> It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need to
    make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't understand
    that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals. Many companies
    think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how to actually get
    it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.\" -Esther Dyson\n\n**Travis:**
    _I want to shift gears a little and talk about one of the company that you are
    invested in, I read something about a merger between Digi.me and Personal. In
    terms of joining forces, they are looking to address the challenges around enhancing
    privacy with healthcare data. But at the same time, enabling people to share and
    potentially combine and analyze data. As you think about your investment there,
    can you share your thoughts on the importance that must be made by healthcare
    IT companies on privacy and security?_\n\n**Esther:** Privacy and security are
    really important but to some extent, there are regular privacy breaches, which
    is an issue to fix. Privacy and [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/)
    often obstruct good healthcare. What you need for good healthcare is to know more
    about the person, not just their result on a particular test. Where do they live?
    What is their income level? In case of opioids, have they applied for drugs at
    any other place? Do they have multiple sources of supply? It’s not a complicated
    thing, it's having both security, privacy and effective data sharing. That's what
    is challenging. It's very easy to guarantee someone privacy, but you also need
    to make their data usable. Many companies are trying to do that, but they don't
    understand that they need to train users and understand the workflow in hospitals.
    Many companies think they have a solution, but they don't necessarily know how
    to actually get it installed and working in the actual healthcare environment.
    \n\n**Travis:** _How do you advise companies to help them navigate that path towards
    implementing the solution and into the workflow of the health system?_\n\n**Esther:**
    I'm generally pretty skeptical. I was just at the doctor earlier this week and
    had blood tests. I got the tests back and they were in a PDF. What I'd really
    like to see is my FitBit data and other personal data, to determine how the blood
    tests changed over time. What I had was a long list of PDFs from various dates
    that were completely useless. Part of the problem is that most of these institutions
    are using large legacy mainframe systems that are incredibly cumbersome. You really
    start to think: \"Throw this all out and start fresh.\" That's what a number of
    vendors are doing but of course, it is very hard to replace the huge installs
    of these systems. \n\nI'm on the board of a company called Wellpass, and invested
    in quite a few others, including 4D Healthware, Healthcelerate, [HealthLoop](https://datica.com/customer/healthloop/),
    Vital Score. They all sell into healthcare systems, and need to understand how
    they work. I don't think a twenty-two year old who just graduated from Stanford
    can know how to fix the healthcare system. You need to have someone that has actually
    worked in a hospital or an insurance company on your team. That's not just so
    you have contacts, but more importantly so that you understand the context, how
    the system works, how the data actually flows. I went to a continuing medical
    education conference once; they had this table where they were handing out medical
    advice for doctors. There was a stack of stapled handouts — twenty-five sheets
    each, double-sided, so fifty pages per handout. Each page was a spreadsheet about
    some particular thing the doctor should do with their patient during the patient
    interview — which of course lasts max fifteen minutes. As a doctor, they are probably
    spending eight or nine minutes typing and and five minutes actually talking. Now
    here’s this sheet of fifty things they are supposed to be doing; some of them
    they’re already doing, and some are only for teenagers and or for women. But you,
    as a vendor, you have to understand that you are either replacing one of those
    fifty things, or adding to them. Do you really understand that context? Can you
    fit into it or make it better with your extra page? Of course, some things are
    for the administrator, or the nurse discharging patients. But whatever your tool
    does, how does it make those people’s lives better and easier? \n\nThat's the
    challenge. Healthcare is a very cumbersome and change-resistant marketplace. The
    companies that have been the most successful are the ones that are eroding things
    around the edges. I love this marketplace because it is interesting and important
    but, if you want to be in this marketplace, you need to understand the challenges.\n\n**Travis:**
    _As we think of how to augment, expand, extend, or in some way work with the EHR
    and EHR data — taking that data and transform it into something a bit more meaningful
    than a CCD or some big PDF — I'm curious what you are finding there._\n\n**Esther:**
    One company out there called PicnicHealth will take your medical records and automatically
    parse them as much as they can and then have humans do the rest. They will have
    people on the phone calling to get your medical documents from all these different
    vendors or different providers and they will make them all into one piece that
    is intelligible. That is really an exciting proposition. As I was just talking
    about my blood draws, I realized I should just call them up and see how they are
    doing and use the service. \n\nThe challenge, of course, is that there are so
    many different varieties and layouts. There is an accepted medical vocabulary
    but there are always little exceptions here and there. A blood value is not something
    you want to get wrong. For the patient, but also for the doctor, you want to make
    sure that if you are comparing data from multiple sources, you want to make sure
    the data is absolutely consistent across all these different sources. It's a challenge
    and there is both a real danger to people and real liability to companies if they
    do it wrong. So, it's going to be a slow process. The more standardized things
    get, the better. Whether you are on a Mac or a PC, we can amazingly have this
    conversation, across different kinds of computers and it is working, more or less.
    \n\n**Travis:** _It is interesting to see how different companies are approaching
    that challenge, both from a consumer standpoint and from FHIR and direct-to-consumer
    enablement authorization of data._\n\n**Esther:** At one end, somebody like [Apple
    and HealthKit](https://datica.com/blog/what-does-healthkit-mean-for-healthcare/)
    is really fostering that. It’s possible; consider how it happened in banking,
    with Intuit. They had this tool Quicken that would let individual bank customers
    interact with their bank portals. Intuit started by reverse-engineering the interfaces
    of a couple of big banks - probably Citibank and BankAmerica (I’m not sure) -
    so users of those banks could download their own data and manage it for themselves,
    even consolidating data from multiple accounts. At first, the banks were very
    resistant but after the first two or three were done, and the customers started
    engaging more with their banks, the other banks noticed. They started saying,
    \"Wow, they are not losing their customers; in fact, those banks are getting even
    more buy-in from their customers. We want this, too.\" They went to Intuit and
    said, \"Please do an API [application program interface] for us.” Suddenly the
    dynamics had changed. Intuit came back and said, “If you want to hook up your
    banks to us, then you have to do the work, but sure, we'd be glad to let you address
    our customer base.” With luck, that's what's going to happen in healthcare. There
    are going to be a lot of vendors now that are interested in working with HealthKit
    and other intermediaries. You are beginning to get this widespread recognition
    that, of course, individuals should be able to see their Fitbit data matched against
    their RunKeeper data and someday matched against blood draws and all the other
    stuff.\n\n**Travis:** _I want to follow up on something else you said. There's
    been a ton of investment in the digital healthcare space over the last five to
    ten years. You mentioned about having someone with experience on the actual care
    side. Can you share two or three consistent success threads that help take a startup
    from a seed investment up through multiple series, from A to B to C?_\n\n**Esther:**
    Basically it all comes down to the team. You need to know something; you need
    to work together effectively; but then you need to be willing to learn and change
    into it; be agile and be humble and all this kind stuff. It's really the attitude
    of “I love what I'm doing, I'm learning from what I'm doing and I'm responding
    to what I'm learning.” Then, it helps if you have a good idea and you are working
    with interesting problems. There are lots of specifics to health or healthcare
    but the fundamental things that make startups successful are pretty much the same.
    \n\n**Travis:** _Curious on team, and investing in team, as you look at presentations
    and pitch decks, do you have an opinion on an ideal team or an ideal mix of people
    on a team that you like to see and you like to invest in._\n\n**Esther:** Very
    clearly, it doesn't consist of the three best people in the world, it consists
    of the best team of three or four, or whatever. A lot of people miss one out of
    the three or four, but you need someone with medical industry knowledge and connections;
    you need someone with technical capacity to build what you need; you need someone
    who understands, whether it is the consumer or the healthcare system that you
    are selling into; but, you also need someone who understands the user proposition,
    especially in healthcare where often the payer is not the same as the user. The
    payer may be the insurance company or the individual, but it may be that the payer
    is the hospital, but the user is a doctor or a nurse. \n\nIt goes back to the
    old software industry, where there was this wonderful set of companies called
    value-added resellers (VARs). They would take the product and go find a corporate
    customer. They would train the IT department and help IT install the software.
    Then they would train the users — the employees making phone calls or doing accounting
    or customer support. The VARs understood it was their problem to make the buyers
    — and the buyers’ employees — like the product. Without VARs, the software vendors'
    customers would usually pilot the software and think it was great, but then they
    would buy it and find out they couldn't get their employees to use it. The vendor
    got the money the first few times and started getting bad references for the product.\n\nI
    think we need a better understanding of the role of VARs (or whatever you want
    to call them these days) in the healthcare market. Whether it’s a third-party
    VAR or your own sales support, you need someone who understands how the hospital
    works, or how the insurance company works to insert their product into the workflow
    and actually make it useful and make the end-user customer say, \"Oh my gosh,
    this makes my job so much easier. I can do referrals automatically instead of
    having to handwrite something on a piece of paper and give it to my nurse and
    she puts it on my desk and it gets lost and I don't get the referral back and
    forth with the other doctors.\" And, of course, the patient doesn't get the benefit
    of going to see the dermatologist.\n\n**Travis:** _Before we conclude the interview,
    Esther, I wanted to ensure we covered everything on the Way to Wellville so that
    we didn’t miss anything there._\n\n**Esther:** Well, I did want to mention [the
    five Wellville communities](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/), just in case
    in case anybody listening either lives in one of them or is nearby. The Wellville
    partner in Muskegon County, Michigan, which is the one that I work with most closely,
    is called [1 in 21](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/muskegon-michigan/).
    The Wellville partner in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is called [Spartanburg’s
    Way to Wellville](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/spartanburg-south-carolina/).
    There's [Hope Rising](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/lake-county-california/)
    in Lake County, California, which is just north of Silicon Valley. There's [Way
    to Wellville: Clatsop County](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/clatsop-county-oregon/),
    northwest of Portland, Oregon. And there's the [Triple Aim Collaborative](http://www.wellville.net/wellville-5/north-hartford-connecticut/)
    in North Hartford, Connecticut. These are all real places with real people. They
    are not social experiments; they are not new towns, but just places that have
    decided they would like a better future for their residents. We are helping them
    build that for themselves. You can find us at [wellville.net](http://www.wellville.net).\n\n**Travis:**
    _Wonderful. Thank you for joining us today, Esther._\n\n**Esther:** Likewise,

  :summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive
    suite. Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health
    Resources.
  :blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
    but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
    from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the
    Chief Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description
    that's evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
  :post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All
    the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things
    that the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017,
    healthcare organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies
    around MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about
    [the evolving role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical
    Information Officer, and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas
    Health Resources, one of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery
    systems in the United States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt
    Texas Health Resources (THR), the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason
    many hospitals added a CMIO in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide
    push toward electronic health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation
    project was a huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction
    rating and its [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was
    the initial reason the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve
    the job definition of a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes
    far beyond EHR. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians,
    are things that the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:**
    Listen to the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the
    CMIO job is like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources
    has implemented the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved
    past stabilization, through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into
    the thick of the volume-based to value-based care transformation broadly taking
    place today. The CMIO's role is shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe
    roadmap going forward is driven by three major things: healthcare regulation,
    defining success as a healthcare organization, and effectively engaging physicians
    in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization is about improving the workflows,\"
    Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling up your sleeves and digging into specific
    and individual workflows and really optimizing those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively,
    THR has found the need to continually engage physicians in the optimization process.
    \"That entails workflow mapping and going back and redesigning care or redesigning
    the workflow, then doing some usability testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing
    that again. In fact, optimization is always a reimplementation of certain workflows,
    so you are just digging in a little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes
    a village\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability
    to collaborate with many different people, both inside and outside the organization.
    Dr. Saldana relies on a network of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how
    others solve similar problems. \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS,
    CHIME, or other forums to really connect with the people that I know are leaders
    in different areas.\" He also relies on industry organizations, like the American
    Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]), to get ideas and answers. I think
    it is important for a CMIO to get out there and not just stay cloistered within
    healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana added.\n\n## Bringing 2017
    into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in healthcare today and CMIOs
    are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for some of the newer technologies
    around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled payments and new digital health
    solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the platform that engages our patients
    and our providers and delivers the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal,\"
    said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about
    as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as they did with Meaningful Use, THR is
    planning to create a steering committee with multi-area representatives from both
    the technology and clinical sides of the fence. Dr. Saldana has this to say about
    MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for [MACRA][7].
    It's going to be how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.\"\n*
    **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare organizations today, minimizing
    risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New EMR workflows for patient
    engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary to provide patients
    with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part of improving value
    is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr. Saldana said, \"The
    point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can have an impact. Ordering
    for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will be critical for us
    as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n* **Investigating
    cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is looking into are
    in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n##
    Staying focused through it all – putting physicians first\n\nAfter spending thirty
    years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves as a representative voice
    of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency physicians get into informatics
    since there are a lot of parallels with emergency medicine and informatics in
    terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be avoided by having someone
    like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians. Dr. Saldana says a big
    part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the eyes of a physician,
    looking specifically at whether or not that new technology will make them more
    efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness to take on the
    burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the bridge between
    the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that
    we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.
    Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important for a CMIO.
    Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for an
    organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores innovation
