  a cumulative 36 years Epic experience.
:blog_lead: |-
  You may have recently seen our press release announcing Datica's [new Chief Operating Officer][1] (COO), Brian Lindstrom. Brian brings deep experience in healthcare coming from a job as CFO of Influence Health in Alabama and, before that, as Controller for Epic, where he played a key role in Epic's rapid growth story.

  </div></div>

  We're excited to have Brian helping to operationalize the vision and strategy for Datica's two main product lines: [compliant cloud][1] and [managed integration][2]. Brian's entrepreneurial spirit is a great addition to the mix of Datica employees whose blood runs through a similar vein. In fact, with Brian's Epic experience, we now have a cumulative 36 years [Epic experience][3] at Datica.

  ## Why Epic Experience Matters So Much

  We got a chance to ask the seven Datica employees what it means to have worked at Epic before and why that's so important to Datica customers. Here are some of the insights they offered.

  1. **A Foundation in Healthcare**
  "I owe my career in healthcare IT to Epic. Working at Epic was a wonderful platform to learn about information technology, infrastructure, and to work with and learn from some of the most influential people and the most influential healthcare organizations in the country," said Casey Bryson, Chief Strategy Officer.
  2. **Understanding How a Customer's Business Works**
  Rochelle Kokomoor, Implementation Director, said, "At Epic, my job was predominantly to ensure that Epic's software met their customer's needs, so I had the benefit of seeing EHR workflows from the end user's perspective. So at Datica, we not only have firsthand experience about what our customers love and hate, but specific workflow knowledge on healthcare systems to which they are connecting. I often hear our customers say, 'I'm really glad I have the interface but your insight into the clinical workflow and helping us design our product – that is amazing! That's what we really needed.' Our deep knowledge of their business and prospective users is the single biggest thing that we contribute to our customers."
  3. **Really Understanding EHRs**
  "EHRs are so complicated with hundreds of them out there. They'll never meet the entire industry's needs. Now that I've left Epic, I've [integrated with so many different EHRs](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/) and in every case, the one thing that I'm most proud of is that Datica is making it easier," commented Rick Wattras, Lead Integration Engineer.
  4. **What True Customer Success Looks Like**
  "Epic's delivery and support were topnotch with a culture that would not allow customers to fail. That culture of customer success is now part of our DNA and something all of us have brought with us to Datica. The end goal is not selling something, but making our customers successful. Coming up with models and EHR implementation strategies to do that at Datica is really exciting," said [Mark Olschesky](https://datica.com/about/mark/), Chief Data Officer.
  5. **Knowing Why Integration is So Hard and Yet Important**
  Tyler Camp, Project Manager, added, "Healthcare issues are incredibly complex and unlikely to all be solved by the large EHR vendors. Innovation and integration with third party solutions is critical to solving the challenges faced in healthcare."
  6. **Expertise in Healthcare Data**
  "Learning how healthcare worked, especially the access and payment side of things, was one of the crucial things I brought to Datica. That data experience and the technical skills that go along with it is an important foundation to helping customers succeed," said Sean Sullivan, Healthcare Integration Engineer.
  7. **Understanding The Pain Datica is Curing**
  "Datica is blazing a trail on both sides of the business – [integration](https://datica.com/managed-integration/) and [HIPAA compliant cloud](https://datica.com/compliant-cloud/). Datica uses managed hosting and integrations to solve interoperability problems that others have yet to solve. Datica is at the tip of the spear and trying to do something that hasn't been done before," concluded Brian Lindstrom, COO.

  These employees have taken the underlying Epic culture to "always do good, while always keeping promises," and have extended that sense of personal honor to how Datica treats its own customers. "The industry insight that emanates from this group of former Epic employees engenders the type of trusted expertise our customers value," said Datica CEO and Chief Privacy Officer [Travis Good, MD][4]. "We feel fortunate to add Brian Lindstrom's financial and operational leadership expertise into the mix."

  :post: |
    Since we launched our EHR Integrations product we learned plenty of lessons about running an integration project on-time and on-budget. Even with years of guiding hospitals through Epic installs and being a former digital health startup founder myself, there were nuances to connecting the intersection of those two worlds that took some time to learn. Out goal is to make those nuances less foreign and more approachable so that _anyone_ can set up an integration without being afraid of the consequences.

    We recently added a new entry to our [Academy](https://datica.com/academy/) library where we discuss the process of integrating with Epic or any other EHR. It's more of a process and less of a technical exercise than you may think. [Read our overview on how to integrate with Epic.](https://datica.com/academy/how-to-integrate-with-epic-or-any-ehr/)

    Included in the new entry is a link to our 30-day project plan for HL7 installs. Full disclosure: working within the constraints of a healthcare organization might have an impact on your go-live date. Despite this, we've managed to run through this plan even faster in the past. Part of the reason we can move so quickly is that we've automated most of the deployment and have the talent in house to execute on it. I'm proud of the EHR Integrations team we've built so far and I'm looking forward to expanding our team and our platform in 2015.

    ## The story behind the rebrand

    Catalyze was a great name for the start of our company  but posed challenges for us as we grew. When talking with others who have been in a similar situation, I found our case was not unique. In fact, this is a situation many companies face  but few talk about it.

    [I talk about the background of the rebrand here](/catalyze/), where I go into deeper detail about the reasonings for the name change. We believe in transparency as a core tenant to all we do, and talking through a rebrand is no different.

    ## Changing the name, not our promises

    While we say goodbye to Catalyze, we are not parting with what makes us the type of business hundreds of organizations trust. We still plan to carry on our foundational traits:

    * Transparency in how we operate internally and externally
    * Commitment to customer success
    * Trust is earned
    * Compliance is fundamental to the success of digital health but is not a differentiator
    * Interoperability is about workflows enablement and not simply data exchange
    * Open source benefits everyone and we're committed to contributing where we can
    * Above all else, deliver on our promises

    ## Healthcare in the cloud

    We're still focused on the same mission as before: products to accelerate the adoption and impact of digital health. We do that through our [Compliant Cloud](/compliant-cloud/) and [Managed Integration](/managed-integration/) offerings. Formerly Stratum and Redpoint, our two core products enable teams across healthcare to remove the barriers associated to digital health by creating trust and solving the problems of integration.

    We also offer [Strategic Services](/strategic-services) for those organizations looking to better develop, test, and implement a digital health strategy. Hospitals and innovative teams across healthcare have found our mix of industry expertise and technical acumen to be a strong voice in the void.

    All this aligns with healthcare's movement to the cloud. Part of the name change is to reaffirm that Datica is the platform for healthcare's transformation. We make it possible for digital health to be a real impact in the industry because we make the interconnectedness of the cloud a reality—finally. And it all comes down to data being secure, compliant, and connected.

    Let us know what you think about the rebrand by tweeting at our new Twitter name [@daticahealth](https://twitter.com/daticahealth).

    On to the next chapter!

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
