:summary: Hospitals are a distinctly lush domain for outsourcing many functions, such
  as, EHR integrations and cloud hosting.
:blog_lead: Healthcare providers are facing increasingly severe economic and social
  pressures that ultimately affect their service budgets and the ability to deliver
  on quality services. As with all businesses, providers must also overcome the tremendous
  pressures of industry competition. In an age where thriving is equivalent to surviving,
  an attractive approach for the healthcare industry is outsourcing. While manifesting
  a vast array of diverse and complex services, hospitals are a distinctly lush domain
  for outsourcing many functions, for example, [EHR Integrations](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
  and [cloud hosting](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/).
:post: |-
  ## Building Internally

  There really are many advantages to providing services by utilizing an internal staff. The weighty benefit is price, assuming that service qualities are comparable. An additional two motives for keeping services in-house are reliable continuity and vested interests. An internal staff has a heightened understanding of the patient requirements and procedures necessary in a multitude of situations. Additionally is the anticipation of continuity. Staff will need to face actionable consequences, leading to increased strategic alignment through fortified internal and client relationships.

  ## Outsourcing as a Strategy

  Expectations of the healthcare consumer are growing, and so are the costs and the competition. Although there are advantages of keeping services in-house, outsourcing offers several unique values. Healthcare is an ever-changing environment where profits plummet, capacity crashes, and service levels slump. In this framework, the advantages of outsourcing non-medical services is a viable strategy to be considered.

  With increasing service volumes, costs per service unit will lessen, meaning outsourcing services can preserve resources through scaling economies. Independent hospitals may be unable to meet the expense levels achieved by external providers when combining their service volumes to various service units. However, outsourcing can only reduce cost when three requisites are me:

  1. There are economies of scale
  2. The economies transcend corporate boundaries
  3. The savings are sufficient to generate profit even after paying off all stakeholders

  The modern need to outsource is rooted in the generational desire to be proactive. Hospitals are incessantly on the brink of slighting margins, [increasing patient expectations](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/) and minimal federal support. However, hospitals now understand the costs of reactive, short-term, tactical solutions to immediate issues. The key to survival lies in leveraging organizational attributes while enacting continuous incremental improvements in effectiveness and efficiency – more often than not by using third-party vendors.

  ## Outsourcing Benchmark Measures

  With that said, healthcare entities need some benchmark metrics to assess the true value of an increased commitment to outsourcing its services at both holistic and strategic levels.

  * **Employee Gratification**: Does internal staff experience increased satisfaction due to outsourced functions and being capable to invest more of time in strategic and innovative initiatives?
  * **Consumer Satisfaction**: Is the outside provider delivering equal or increased service to consumers in contrast to in-house services? Is staff more attentive to core functions due to outsourcing?
  * **Economic Value Contribution**: Does the external vendor deliver more efficiently to achieve cost savings? Is the entity able to evade additional costs by outsourcing?
  * **Competitive Advantages**: Is there a competitive edge with outsourcing? Are prospective and existing clients increasing service engagements because of outsourced services?
  * **Allocation of Resources**: Is the service provider reliably delivering the required quality and scope through dedicated resources: labor, technology, knowledge, and assets? Is the current allocation of resources appropriate for the agreed upon objective? Is the resource division mutually satisfactory?

  In sum, the advantages of outsourcing are that hospitals can assume access to asset improvement funds, widespread risk sharing of [HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/), increased cost avoidance and savings, considerable resource access, enhanced employee retention, and raised patient satisfaction. Long-term strategic, transformative partnerships with vendors may introduce market opportunities beyond either party's core competence. A few long-term, strategic service vendors may be a more fruitful arrangement in comparison to a multitude of narrow-focused, short-term, one-off relationships.

  :summary: Chief Medical Information Officer is an evolving role in the executive
    suite. Learn about the CMIO job from Luis Saldana, M.D., CMIO of Texas Health
    Resources.
  :blog_lead: Most people are familiar with the role a CIO plays in a health system
    but the mention of a CMIO would likely elicit questioning looks or shoulder shrugs
    from many. As one of the newest members of the healthcare executive suite, the
    Chief Medical Information/Informatics Officer (CMIO) has a complex job description
    that's evolving in parallel to the shift from volume-based to value-based care.
  :post: "\n> \"With digitalization of healthcare the job goes far beyond EHR. All
    the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians, are things
    that the CMIO can have influence over.\" *Luis Saldana, MD*\n\nAs we begin 2017,
    healthcare organizations nationwide will be tapping their CMIOs to provide strategies
    around MACRA, MIPS, physician satisfaction, and more. We recently chatted about
    [the evolving role of the hospital CMIO][2] with Luis Saldana, MD, Chief Medical
    Information Officer, and Medical Director of Clinical Decision Support at Texas
    Health Resources, one of the largest faith-based, nonprofit healthcare delivery
    systems in the United States.\n\n## The ever-changing role of the CMIO \n\nAt
    Texas Health Resources (THR), the reason the CMIO job was added was the same reason
    many hospitals added a CMIO in the age of [Meaningful Use][4] – to drive the system-wide
    push toward electronic health record (EHR) implementation. That multi-year implementation
    project was a huge success at THR as measured by its 95% physician satisfaction
    rating and its [HIMSS Davies Award][5] win.\n\nThough the core EHR platform was
    the initial reason the CMIO role was created, Dr. Saldana continues to evolve
    the job definition of a CMIO. \"With digitalization of healthcare, the job goes
    far beyond EHR. All the systems that touch that platform, or even touch our clinicians,
    are things that the CMIO can have influence over,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n_**Related:**
    Listen to the [complete podcast][2] to hear in Dr. Saldana's own words what the
    CMIO job is like._\n\n## Life in the post-EHR era\n\nNow that Texas Health Resources
    has implemented the EHR as its core clinical platform, the organization has moved
    past stabilization, through a few cycles of workflow optimization, and right into
    the thick of the volume-based to value-based care transformation broadly taking
    place today. The CMIO's role is shifting right alongside that transformation.\n\nThe
    roadmap going forward is driven by three major things: healthcare regulation,
    defining success as a healthcare organization, and effectively engaging physicians
    in workflow optimization cycles. \"True optimization is about improving the workflows,\"
    Dr. Saldana explained. \"That means rolling up your sleeves and digging into specific
    and individual workflows and really optimizing those.\"\n\nTo do that effectively,
    THR has found the need to continually engage physicians in the optimization process.
    \"That entails workflow mapping and going back and redesigning care or redesigning
    the workflow, then doing some usability testing, getting buy-in, and then implementing
    that again. In fact, optimization is always a reimplementation of certain workflows,
    so you are just digging in a little bit deeper,\" said Dr. Saldana.\n\n## It takes
    a village\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an effective CMIO is the ability
    to collaborate with many different people, both inside and outside the organization.
    Dr. Saldana relies on a network of colleagues, vendors, and peers to explore how
    others solve similar problems. \"I take every opportunity when I go to HIMSS,
    CHIME, or other forums to really connect with the people that I know are leaders
    in different areas.\" He also relies on industry organizations, like the American
    Medical Informatics Association® ([AMIA][6]), to get ideas and answers. I think
    it is important for a CMIO to get out there and not just stay cloistered within
    healthcare, but really be out there,\" Dr. Saldana added.\n\n## Bringing 2017
    into focus\n\nThere's a paradigm shift taking place in healthcare today and CMIOs
    are emerging as direct decision-makers or champions for some of the newer technologies
    around the EHR, for example, platforms for bundled payments and new digital health
    solutions. \"If we are successful at creating the platform that engages our patients
    and our providers and delivers the best care for them, that's the ultimate goal,\"
    said Dr. Saldana.\n\nHere are some of the key things Dr. Saldana is thinking about
    as CMIO in 2017:\n\n* **MACRA.** Just as they did with Meaningful Use, THR is
    planning to create a steering committee with multi-area representatives from both
    the technology and clinical sides of the fence. Dr. Saldana has this to say about
    MACRA, \"If you've done Meaningful Use well, you will be well prepared for [MACRA][7].
    It's going to be how you organize as to whether you are successful or not.\"\n*
    **Cybersecurity.** As is true in most healthcare organizations today, minimizing
    risk continues to be a top concern at THR.\n* **New EMR workflows for patient
    engagement.** In 2017, THR is thinking about what is necessary to provide patients
    with access to their data.\n* **Improving value.** A big part of improving value
    is reducing costs and looking at how the EMR can do that. Dr. Saldana said, \"The
    point of ordering is always seen as the first place you can have an impact. Ordering
    for imaging, lab ordering, medications — all of those will be critical for us
    as we decide what the MACRA program will look like at THR.\"\n* **Investigating
    cognitive technologies and AI.** Technology advancements THR is looking into are
    in the areas of cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n##
    Staying focused through it all – putting physicians first\n\nAfter spending thirty
    years as an emergency physician, Dr. Saldana serves as a representative voice
    of physicians in his organization. \"You see emergency physicians get into informatics
    since there are a lot of parallels with emergency medicine and informatics in
    terms of the process.\"\n\nPhysician burnout can be avoided by having someone
    like the CMIO be the sounding board for those physicians. Dr. Saldana says a big
    part of his job is vetting new technology ideas through the eyes of a physician,
    looking specifically at whether or not that new technology will make them more
    efficient and effective, and if they have the change readiness to take on the
    burden of change.\n\nDr. Saldana concludes, \"The CMIO role is the bridge between
    the clinical and the technical. I think one of the things that we see now is that
    we are in a constant state of change in healthcare, which is obviously disconcerting.
    Having both the organizational and clinical barometers is important for a CMIO.
    Then you can be the voice on both sides to say whether something is good for an
    organization or not in terms of technologies.\"\n\n_Datica explores innovation

  :summary: Healthcare enterprises are striving to achieve the “triple threat of patient
    engagement"
  :blog_lead: |-
    Healthcare enterprises are striving to achieve the “triple threat of patient engagement":

    -  Enhance the patient care experience (quality and gratification)
    -  Improve the general population health
    -  Minimize cost of care
  :post: "However, these goals cannot be met, or even neared, without a properly implemented
    patient engagement strategy. \n\nHere are 5 tips we believe are key factors in
    developing a prosperous strategy for any healthcare entity:\n\n### 1. There is
    no \"One Size Fits All\" Patient Engagement Solution\n\nThe new age of healthcare
    primarily focuses on patient engagement as a way to reduce costs. Practically
    everyone in the industry agrees that patient engagement is important, yet there
    is no consistent solution. Engagement paragons cannot be treated as “one size
    fits all” solutions but instead must cover a broader scale of needs tailored towards
    the segmented needs of the populace.\n\n### 2. Recognize Vital Metrics to Continually
    Gauge ROI\n\nPatient engagement solutions and their larger financial initiatives
    should always be understood to maximize on the ROI based on certain factors, such
    as:\n\n- Progressive Care Outcomes\n- Efficiency Reserve Savings\n- Revenue generated
    from evading further surgical services\n- Non-monetary gains — increased patient
    satisfaction, employee engagement, etc.\n- Greater Patient and Provider Education\n\n###
    3. Timing is Everything\n\nPatients and the general populace fail to remember
    everything. It has been shown that patients only retain near 20% of information
    provided and 50% of that is remembered erroneously. Engage your patients at the
    right time through the proper channels by feeding modest amounts of information
    to avoid overwhelming patients. Step-by-step documented care plans are a great
    option to implement into your strategy. \n\n### 4. Confirm Compliance with HIPAA
    and Meaningful Use\n\nWhen deciding upon a solution to implement, it is essential
    that providers meet and comply with HIPAA standards. And since most patient portal
    technologies are new, entities fail to understand the implications behind non-compliance,
    especially in relation to secure messaging or data storage. Do thorough research
    on the new Meaningful Use guidelines and ensure your technology providers are
    in adherence. \n\n### 5. Scalable Solutions that Close Gaps in Healthcare\n\nWhen
    a subset of the populace is identified in care, messages must be delivered to
    the patients to notify them of the gap in care and how to provide next steps to
    close this gap. Based on patient preferences, notifications can be channeled through
    emails, texts, patient portals, phone calls, etc. All notifications should have
    a clear call to action and link back to a website or provide a phone number to
    reach the physician’s office. It should be made clear what a patient’s next steps
    are. Tools must allow for automation and high-volume interventions to reach patients
    in the most time-efficient and cost-effective manner."

  :post: |-
    ## The Joint Commission (TJC)

    Being the most well-known, hospitals and health systems all maintain TJC accreditation regarding their clinical care processes, ability and performance on specific quality measures and standards of care. TJC has been involved in performance measurement since the mid-1980s and launched its ORYX initiative in the late 1990s as the first national program for measurement of hospital quality. TJC has established standardized core performance measure sets for hospital operations and contributes to the national strategy for improving healthcare quality transparency. The Joint Commission can also be found at the forefront of new programs such as MACRA/MIPS.

    ## Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

    CMS mandates the reporting of quality measures by hospitals, physicians, and providers of other healthcare products and services. CMS's Measures Management System provides a standardized process for ensuring that CMS will have a rational, conspicuous system to measure the quality of care delivered to recipients. This system was developed in coordination with the other organizations mentioned in this post. CMS collaborates with private, nonprofit organizations such as The Joint Commission and the American Medical Association to create quality measures necessary for regulatory compliance, including the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program, the Physician Quality Reporting System, and Hospital Compare.

    ## National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)

    The NCQA is one of the main certification and accreditation organizations for patient-centric medical home initiatives, health plan accreditations, disease and case management, and other healthcare provider certification and recognition programs. The NCQA provides and governs the development of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) ambulatory care measures.

    ## National Quality Forum (NQF)

    The NQF has a focus on building consensus on national healthcare goals and priorities for quality measurement and performance improvement, being the industry's leading endorsement organization for the development and approval of quality measures. As new quality measures are developed and tested, the NQF plays a vital role in validating measures prior to official use and implementation.

    ## American Medical Association (AMA)

    The AMA, a national association for physicians, convened the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in 2000. Since then, the PCPI has grown to include participants from various organizations and has identified copious measures spanning multiple measure sets. The PCPI is continually working to develop measures on patient-centric care.

    ## Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)

    AHRQ is an entity within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides a clearinghouse for quality measures, coordination of evidence-based best practics, and annual reportings of national clinical quality measures. AHRQ also manages the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) patient satisfaction surveys.

    ## Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC)

    The URAC is a healthcare quality accreditation organization for health plans, provider organizations, and physician practices with various accreditation and certification programs. These programs include healthcare utilization reviews, patient-centered healthcare homes (PCHCH), pharmacy benefits management, healthcare website maintenance, claims management, and disease management to list a few. These accreditations serve an important purpose for insurance commissioners, state and federal legislators, employers, and consumers because they are a sign of a high quality and represent the organization's ability to meet agreeable performance metrics levels.

    Since these quality measure reportings are mandated by government regulations, the ability to harmonize these measures has become an important discussion topic. These mandated reportings may ultimately contradict internal quality improvement efforts focused on different measures. These different metrics may have overlapping population segments, track performance for supporting or competing quality measurement organizations, or require seemingly identical measures of conditions or diseases but utilize different data, exclusions, numerators, or denominators.  Having an understanding of these organizations is critical in healthcare, so if you have questions, reach out to us [directly][1], [tweet us][2], or provide us your contact information to the right.

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
