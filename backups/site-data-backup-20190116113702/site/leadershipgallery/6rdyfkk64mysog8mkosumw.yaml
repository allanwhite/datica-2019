  :description: Typically "patient engagement", or ways to assist and interact with
    the people being helped in healthcare systems.
:summary: Dr. Marc Chasin asserts that before healthcare organizations can claim to
  be patient-centric, they first need to better at adopting patient-centric technology.
:lead: 'Many health systems state in their mission and their vision that they are
  patient-centric. I don''t believe that we have seen a patient-centric organization
  yet. The challenge is not technology-adoption: just look at the fast advancements
  in MRI screening. But healthcare needs to be better at adopting patient-centric
  technology in order for organizations to be truly patient-centric.'
:post: "A truly patient-centric health system would let patients own their medical
  records and have immediate access to their results, their medical images, and their
  notes. They could take it all with them to plug into the different electronic health
  records systems as desired. Doctors would contribute, save a copy, and return it
  back to the patient.\n\n> To ensure that digital health systems provide value to
  the people we serve, we need to flip the paradigm and give more power to the patient.
  This would make it easier for them to receive care when they want to, not based
  upon the hours that a health system or a clinic runs. It’s also a great way to remove
  some of the burden on the health system and the physician. \n\nMy team and I are
  just starting to look at this from the perspectives of compliance, security, and
  the ability to maintain the transactional nature of the record. As a physician,
  I understand the medical culture. I have run a large IT shop and understand the
  inner workings of the IT department. I've also been on the hospital operations side
  so I understand how a health system and a hospital runs.\n\nWhich is why I believe
  we need to provide care where our community needs it, from clicks to bricks. We
  have to be available online, whether our patients are sitting in their home watching
  TV, or in a movie theater, or at work. But bricks matter too, because you will never
  be able to do a heart surgery or a valve replacement or a hip repair virtually.\n\nThis
  paradigm change raises the question of privacy. Right now, the health system is
  accountable for privacy of medical records. If the patient becomes the steward of
  the data, they own the privacy as well, including what they divulge and what they
  decide to do with the data.\n\nPrivacy differs across the generations, with baby
  boomers more protective of their health information and millennials more willing
  to share. And where is the line? There are different grades of privacy now, too.
  I might divulge my medical records by telling my Facebook friends that I’m in bed
  with a sinus infection. But if I were diagnosed with metastatic brain cancer, I'm
  not necessarily going to put on social media that I have a terminal disease. \n\nThe
  issue of speed comes back to the patient as well. The only way we are going to get
  health systems to move more quickly is to refocus on who our true customer is. Until
  now it has been the physician, but it must be the patient.\n\n> People have said
  that health care is behind the times in technology. I would disagree because we
  have the most cutting edge medical technology in the world. When the medical field
  realizes the clinical benefit of technology, it is adopted immediately. We upgrade
  MRIs from 32-slice to 64-slice and now we're going to an even higher density. \n\nBut
  when you walk into a hospital after using your iPhone and iPad at home, it’s like
  walking into 2005. It is the general day-to-day capture of the patient story where
  we're lagging on technology. \n\nWe have tried to appease our customers over these
  years and our customers have been the practicing physicians. We focused on investing
  in the technologies that they want -- the best CT scanner, the best MRI, the best
  surgical equipment. We have tried to make our customers’ lives easier by selectively
  deploying technology that draws them in.\n\nNow that our customer focus may be expanding
  to the patients, I see four factors that will drive the digital health industry
  to adapt new technologies to that new customer.\n\nFirst, the cost of care is rising
  exponentially. If I can get my care on my phone, I'm going to do that before going
  into the doctor's office. \n\nSecond, patients want to see how they're doing, so
  aside from developing analytics for our providers and our revenue cycle and our
  house operations, we need apps and services for people to compare themselves to
  other similar patients. \n\nThird, it gets back to consumerism. Being able to have
  an Amazon mobile health offering would not only improve the appeal of a health system,
  it would build better employee-patient engagement and so lead to better outcomes.\n\nAnd
  finally, we have an additional customers now, the small business employers who are
  paying for insurance. They are looking for a value proposition to covering their
  employees, and they're looking for an increased risk-sharing arrangement than has
  been previously employed.\n\nA patient-centered approach will not be an easy shift
  to make. We still have resistance on the open notes initiative, letting patients
  see the visit or clinic notes that health care providers include in medical records.
  The transformation of care is only going to come when we truly let the patient in
  to make some of these critical decisions."
