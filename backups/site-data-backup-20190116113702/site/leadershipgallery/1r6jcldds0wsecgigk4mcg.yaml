:summary: 'Lyle Berkowitz, MD of healthfinch shares how the future of healthcare is
  going to be based on an technology empowered, team-based care approach.

'
:lead: When a new technology is introduced, productivity often declines a bit while
  everyone works out the kinks, before jumping up significantly. Unfortunately, when
  it comes to digital health technology, we are still trapped in this productivity
  paradox after 20 years of the modern age of healthcare information technology (HIT).
:post: "However, technology itself is not the core problem – rather, it's how HIT
  was created and deployed that has created so many problems. The gaming industry
  could think conceptually and translate two-dimensional board games into an amazingly
  fun and easy to use three-dimensional experience. In healthcare, by contrast, software
  designers stuck to the paradigm of the paper record, thereby limiting themselves
  in multiple ways. And perhaps even worse, the designers and implementers focused
  on having physicians do all the data entry, rather than thinking about how other
  personnel, or even the computer, could help in that task. \n\nFortunately there
  is still hope. Digital health technology can still make doctors happier and patients
  healthier if we focus on how to simplify, automate, and delegate care so that the
  right people do the right work. A human centered design approach will help us to
  start building tools and workflows that solve for quality and efficiency at the
  same time. \n\nAt healthfinch, for example, anything we create must make life easier
  for doctors and save them time. We challenge our team to automate what can be automated,
  delegate what can be delegated, and simplify everything else. It sounds like an
  easy concept, but it's not something that's traditionally done in the HIT world.
  \n\nTake refills, as a prototypical workflow that can be optimized. A typical primary
  care doctor may have to respond to 10-20 refill requests a day. What if we had a
  smart rules engine that could assess the work flow coming in and automate the process
  of reviewing everything based on approved, standardized, evidence-based protocols.
  Then we would delegate it to the appropriate staff person to handle based on doctor
  approved protocols. Meanwhile, we can automate other processes, such as contacting
  a patient about a follow up appointment, or denying duplicate refill requests.  Finally,
  if a refill has to be sent to a doctor, we can explain the reasoning in simple terms
  to ensure the doctor can make a quick decision. \n\nThis type of workflow automation
  would achieve what everyone says is impossible - improved quality, saving time,
  cutting costs, and increasing both patient and physician satisfaction all at the
  same time! And we know from other industries that technology can do even more if
  we let it reach its full maturity! It's astounding that we let automated cars roam
  our streets where our kids are playing, but we continue to have inertia and barriers
  to letting routine workflows be automated by a computer when it can be done quicker
  and more safely than how we do it now. \n\nUnfortunately, a big part of these barriers
  are the increasing amount of regulations and requirements that have built up over
  the past two decades around documentation and workflow. It has gotten to the point
  that studies now show for every hour of direct patient care, there's at least another
  hour of extra work. As expected, the more we pile onto the non-patient facing work,
  the more doctors cut their patient load. A recent survey reported that typical primary
  care doctors saw 98 patients a week in 2011, working 54 hours a week. A repeat of
  the survey in 2016 found that primary care doctors had cut their weekly workload
  to 76 patients, while still working 54 hours – helping prove the theory that we
  are seeing increasing administrative work for every patient seen.  \n\nSo what might
  we do to reverse this situation? Let’s start by making sure regulations do not get
  in the way. For example, the rules around scope of practice were developed many
  decades ago, well before we anticipated electronic medical records and computerized
  technology. As a result, they wind up being hard to interpret and sometimes restrictive
  in today’s high tech world. \n\nThe scope-of-practice laws are at the state level,
  so we need to lobby our state lawmakers to closely re-examine those laws. If it's
  simply not clear what a doctor can delegate or what a computer can automate, they
  need to clarify that rule. And if a rule forbids such delegation, then maybe we
  need to update and adjust those laws.  \n\nAt the federal level, it might be a good
  idea to do an assessment of the different scope of practice laws across the nation.
  At the very least, this can provide insight for all the states. At the very most,
  it might become clear that some federal regulations or interpretations should be
  considered. \n\n> If we want to save our healthcare system, both software designers
  and lawmakers need to understand that, just like every other industry, we need to
  be able to easily automate and delegate more activities. With doctor-approved protocols
  and oversight, it can and should be safe and effective and efficient to delegate
  more of the routine and repeatable activities that happen every day.\n\nThe future
  of healthcare is going to be a form of information technology empowered, team-based
  care approach that allows for massive scalability. In this scenario, a doctor may
  see fewer patients face to face, but will be enabled to take care of many more patients
  via their team. Of course, we also need to balance this with the fact that relationship
  between the patient and their providers is still very human and local. We need to
  preserve this sacred doctor-patient relationship, but perhaps expand it to the whole
  care team – saving both patients and physicians at the same time. I know technology
  can help us figure out how to do this and create the future we want and need. "
