  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."

:summary: Let’s face it, in medicine, we’re often naïve when we do something new.
  We've learned a great deal about digital health technology, so let's make the most
  of what we've learned.
:lead: There is a great deal of discussion now about electronic health records and
  the fact that we need to “do it right,” which implies we did not get it right the
  first time around. Let’s face it, in medicine, we’re often naïve when we do something
  new. We've learned a great deal about digital health technology, so let's make the
  most of what we've learned.
:post: "The most important lesson is that health systems designers got the audience
  wrong. They focused on accountants, not physicians. The software packages are designed
  from the perspective of the financial folks who want to capture every charge, but
  that’s not necessarily what the people face-to-face with patients see as valuable.
  \n\nThere is a massive conflict between the care of patients and the business of
  health care. We need to put decision-making on digital health technology back in
  the hands of doctors and nurses make sure they are equipped to focus on patients.
  \n\nHealth is a huge industry, and like any other form of commerce, the people handling
  the money are calling the shots. The less connected a manager is from the actual
  activities in the clinic, the harder it is to know what’s important for the care
  aspect of what goes on. You find administrators pressuring doctors to see more patients,
  and doctors refusing because they have a different set of metrics. This ground-level
  understanding may be the reason why the best-performing health systems are the ones
  led by physicians. \n\nFrom a business perspective, it is tempting to treat digital
  health like a mechanical system, and the patients are the items on the conveyor
  belt. The mechanical system seeks to optimize performance based on everything being
  predictable, but the item on the conveyor belt – a human being -- is the least predictable
  thing in the world.\n\nA physician speaking with a patient about a heart condition
  knows the risk factors and what medications would be best to try first, but every
  person has psychological overlay. When you ask a question, you can't predict how
  long the response is going to be. And if a person’s anxiety, as well as their heart
  disease is not addressed, they're going to come away saying, \"I got horrible care.\"
  \n\nThe business of health care is increasingly focused on data and analytics to
  make decision-making more efficient, but the practice of health care is about people,
  and there is no consistency in how they age, and how their health advances or diminishes.\n\nThink
  of two grocery stores across the street from one another. The ideal customer is
  somebody who comes in, buys high-margin items, doesn't require any help, and is
  friendly and nice. That's a predictable interaction, and it brings you a profit.
  Then you have an older person come in with limited mobility and compromised sight,
  who doesn't hear well, and is on a fixed budget. This person takes up a lot of time,
  and you make almost no money. \n\nFrom a purely business standpoint, you would send
  the second customer to the store across the street, and keep the good business for
  yourself. In health care, from a business standpoint, most people are healthy, the
  equivalent of the first customer Yet when most of us think about health care, we
  worry above all about what happens when we develop something that needs a lot of
  attention. I think this is a very important distinction.\n\nIt’s rational to use
  data and analytics to help make better decisions. To a doctor, data would improve
  quality if somebody has a complex health record, and you want to know whether there
  is a correlation between taking a certain medication and having a an abnormal lab
  value. A data management system should allow you to do a search for the lab value
  and when the medication was taken, and it should throw up a graph tracking each
  parameter.\n\nThat would be a huge benefit, and it's doable. But all the accountants
  care about is that when you got the lab test, it got billed, and when you wrote
  a prescription for the drug, it got billed. That's why the system underperforms.
  The opportunity to make things so much better is huge. \n\nThere is a saying that
  there are two groups of patients, those with insurance and those without. I would
  say that an even more important distinction is between patients with straightforward,
  easily addressable maladies, and there are patients with threatening, scary illnesses.
  From the operation of the system, those are the two groupings that matter more.
  \n\nIt’s great to be able to streamline care when a child comes in with an ear infection.
  But health care just as importantly exists for the people who suddenly find out
  that they have leukemia. That person is going to consume enormous amounts of your
  resources and a lot of people's time, and any system that says we've got to have
  the two-minute app for everybody is going to fail. \n\nSooner or later we are all
  going to be in the small group of people with serious illnesses, and we forget that
  at our peril. After all, most people know that that’s where the health care rubber
  meets the road. The top office people need to be closer to the front line so they
  don't lose sight of what their mission really means. "
