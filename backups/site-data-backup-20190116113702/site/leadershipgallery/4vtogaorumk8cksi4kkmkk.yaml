    the people being helped in healthcare systems.
:summary: 'Gregory A. Ator, MD discusses how and why even though its a positive development
  overall, most doctors say technology has made them less productive, not more.  '
:lead: Digital health technology has been around for some time, and it’s not been
  a completely positive development for medicine. With all the focus on standardization
  and cost-savings, I think we've lost the appreciation in technology for the doctor-patient
  relationship. Most doctors might say technology, as currently implemented, has made
  them less productive not more.
:post: "But now the field of digital health systems is in a state of flux, and there
  is great potential to improve the physician experience. We need to work to ensure
  that technology can help, and not impede, that experience. \n\nThe work of the physician
  has always been about making good decisions that are informed by the specific circumstances
  of the patient in front of you. Ideally as a doctor you have a conversation that
  takes the patient through what’s wrong and the various treatment options. You have
  a data source, and it would be nice to have a little genetic information as well.\n\nWe
  need this relationship to be at the core of any technology we introduce. I think
  it would be great to go into a room with a patient and have the conversation recorded.
  You would verbalize the physical exam, do some medical decision-making, develop
  a plan, and educate the patient. Then an extract would go to the patient, with various
  links helping them to digest that information. When you get back to your desk with
  the list of patients for the day, that conversation is right there. You validate,
  tweak it a little bit, receive and act on any clinical decision support, and then
  you’re done. What we do now is we have that conversation with the patient, and then
  we come back out and do it again to fill out the records. \n\nThat gets the documentation
  out of the way of the doctor doing what they do, which is making decisions. Carefully
  bolting on smarter technology is how I see IT playing a role toward bringing the
  joy back to the workflow, and giving physicians more control over the tools that
  they're using. \n\n> The opportunity to improve the physician experience is more
  likely to come from digital and mobile solutions than the large vendors running
  our systems for electronic health records. I think we’re going to use the big vendors
  to run the general business, of course, but go externally to specialty firms for
  add-ons and extensions to do this work.\n\nI don't think big vendors are agile enough,
  particularly when you have multiple moving pieces. I’m seeing this in my own work
  at the University of Kansas Medical Center, where we are in the midst of a big project
  with a number of initiatives around redesigning our ambulatory support structure.\n\nInteroperability
  is a huge challenge, even starting with some core questions like what patient are
  we talking about? I’ve seen a statistic that if you're talking to a Mary Smith,
  there's about a ten percent chance she is not the Mary Smith you think she is. With
  human frailties and technological limitations involved in collecting information
  about patients, it’s hard to ensure you are tying all the different versions together.
  \n\nMedicare and insurance companies can take big strides toward fixing inoperability
  by just stating, for example, that they are not going to pay for an advanced imaging
  study on the same body part within a month of one another. Suddenly providers are
  going to figure out how to look at each other's exams. We should think about how
  to start aligning incentives to promote innovation and a new way of doing things.\n\n>
  Until now, we’ve treated our patients as one size fits all when it comes to digital
  health technology. We as physicians know how to modulate our vocabulary to our patients,
  because we’re trying to communicate rather than talk at people. So how do our systems
  and our entire enterprise start to figure that out?\n\nAn intriguing approach is
  to stratify patients and then tailor the technology. We're going to have about 10
  more years before old geezers like me are out of the decision-making seat, and we're
  starting to compete for digital native patients. The twenty to thirty year olds
  that are starting to become our patients don't even know what a travel agency is.
  That's going to be interesting as they become health care consumers and decision
  makers. \n\nWe need to think more like a retail business. In clothing sales, you
  can now see a virtual reality display of what a shirt would look like if you were
  wearing it. That's a much more digitalized retail experience than just pictures
  of somebody that looks like you. We need to be figuring out the health care equivalent
  of the salty snack crowd vs the fitness crowd. I don't think we can treat patients
  who don't have a single book in their house the same way you might treat a university
  professor. I don’t in the office and we must not in the enterprise. Same care standards
  but delivery, interactions, etc. must vary.  \n\nWhen you modulate your approach
  to technology based on patient stratification, you know what tool is best to the
  gear heads, and what works for those folks who spend their time reading.\n\nUpstart
  technology firms are well placed to do this. I think the big vendors are ripe for
  disruption, and there is evidence they are starting to pay attention as well. I’m
  optimistic we will soon see technology that will redirect our focus to the doctor-patient
  experience."
