  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."

:summary: Jocelyn DeWitt, PhD describes how mobile and cloud technologies are powering
  a huge step forward in healthcare innovation with greater agility and standardization.
:lead: 'Electronic health records were intended to bring some agility to the management
  of health care, but agile is not how I would describe the digital health system.
  We are only now beginning to understand the meaning of the word. '
:post: "Digital health transformation is about to take a huge step forward. Hospitals
  are moving away from standardization of health care technology and the limits it
  imposes. At the same time, we need to create a more standardized approach to how
  we adopt and deploy new capabilities. \n\nI came to UW Health in Madison four years
  ago to help integrate the organization and expand across the state. With a background
  in economics, urban planning, and political science, my role is to hire excellent
  technology folks and translate between the strategic direction of UW Health and
  the technology and information systems required to support those strategies.\n\nWe
  are now working on a single strategy, but we have many initiatives under way. Mobile
  technology will be an incredibly important part of our toolkit for making these
  pieces more accessible to our clinicians. They include tools for getting data from
  patients and their devices into our system for use by the clinicians, as well as
  for delivering information back to them, whether they're an inpatient or an ambulatory
  patient. \n\nThere has been an IT drumbeat for some time around standardization
  but health care is an area where I don't think you should standardize because it
  doesn't make any sense. For example, unlike other industries, health care is not
  a homogenous group of people and organizations, it comprises the big systems, the
  little systems, and the physician offices. \n\nWe are coming out of a phase of disillusionment
  and trying to be realistic about what we can and can't do with electronic health
  records, which represent the push to standardization a decade or so ago.  If you
  ask a physician to go back to paper, they would definitely refuse, but I don’t think
  EHRs have achieved the success that was promised. We set too-high expectations for
  them. \n\nWith a more reasonable understanding of what an EHR can do, my team and
  I are focused on how to limit its use to clinical needs while adding in other features
  and functionalities we would like and that support our organizational mission and
  goals. \n\nWe are trying to think more strategically, exploring the notion of a
  single enterprise architecture that can serve as a platform for standardizing the
  deployment and integration of these new capabilities.\n\nFor this to work well,
  it will be important to have a process for evaluating whether or not we should build
  a new technology within our existing EHR system, rather than assume it’s the only
  option. I am not interested in throwing more money at something just because we
  already sunk millions of dollars into it.\n\nWe are now taking a step back and developing
  a governance process across both our clinical systems and our administrative systems
  where we take suggestions for new services and prioritize them based on our institutional
  strategies, our knowledge of the market, and which ones make sense to us. \n\nWe
  need a good way to quickly scan the market of creative new vendors out there to
  understand how easily we could incorporate this into our EHR platform and how easily
  can they maintain it. It's a noisy space.\n\nI'm very interested in cloud-based
  solutions and we're looking to try and take advantage of that kind of platform.
  The hope is that service-based software will provide the agility that we can't offer
  internally. Thanks to the standardization pushed by the EHR vendors, we cannot be
  as agile as our providers would like us to be. \n\nInstead, our IT teams are tied
  down by the huge burden of maintaining the system itself, which is unrewarding work
  and pretty expensive.  When we own our systems, every 18 months or so we spend about
  28,000 person hours doing an upgrade, instead of being able to focus on implementing
  our own new initiatives. We can’t explore or develop the innovative ideas that our
  physicians would like to see.  \n\n> We need to figure out how best to standardize
  the way we integrate and deploy new digital health solutions in a way that does
  not disrupt our colleagues in governance, health information management, or compliance.
  The last thing we need is an even more complicated ball of spaghetti that we must
  maintain and keep secure, while keeping regulators happy. \n\nWith such a robust
  enterprise architecture in place, we would finally be able to work with the agility
  we need to be effective."
