  :description: Regarding healthcare information workflows with systems like EHRs.
:summary: 'Christiana DelloRusso, PhD shares her thoughts on the challenges of innovation
  in this introduction to The Heart of Medicine: Rethinking Healthcare Technology. '
:lead: Delivering good healthcare in what has become a highly regulated, fragmented,
  and misaligned ecosystem is incredibly difficult. Ongoing debates on the political
  stage reflect the enormous challenge of working with a multitude of discordant stakeholders.
  And what’s often forgotten in the chaos is the sacred interaction between healthcare
  provider and patient.
:post: "Both participants involved in this central interaction are frustrated with
  the dated, user-unfriendly technology and unending paperwork that characterizes
  healthcare. \n\nTechnology entrepreneurs trying to help solve big problems in healthcare
  are similarly frustrated with how slow health systems and delivery facilities move
  to make decisions on and deploy new technology. Daily transactions that we take
  for granted now — purchases of products and services, researching or providing reviews
  of retail locations and service providers, or simply visualizing on a map where
  we need to go for our next appointment – are all seamlessly performed digitally.
  Healthcare can sometimes feel light years away from this kind of digital transformation;
  for instance, we get really excited about enabling online scheduling for our patients!
  \n\nProvidence Ventures sees opportunity in these challenges. We work closely with
  our operators inside the health system and entrepreneurs on the outside to source,
  enable and scale transformative healthcare solutions. We understand how hard it
  is to achieve meaningful engagement and scale in a healthcare system, and commit
  to being a trusted partner in forging progress together with our portfolio companies.
  \n\nIf we’re successful, we think we’ll achieve better health of our communities
  together. What does that future state potentially look like? \n\nFirst, health systems
  and providers will truly engage patients as whole human beings, and be trusted partners
  in their achievement of health. We need to connect consistently, reliably and thoughtfully
  to support wellness, versus only engaging in sick care. We will have more meaningful
  connections with each individual, personalizing their experience with us, and fulfilling
  the Providence Promise that for each of our patients, we will Know them, Care for
  them, and Ease their way. \n\nSecond, we will reduce the enormous amount of friction
  that exists in healthcare transactions. So much of a healthcare encounter could
  be digitized and streamlined, from check-in to payment, relieving providers and
  health systems of reams of paperwork, and giving all stakeholders time back to perform
  critical actions and focus on the engagement itself, increasing quality and reducing
  costs. The technology exists; deploying and scaling it in the healthcare environment
  is the hard part.\n\nThird, we will move the needle on the health of populations.
  The enormous potential of preventative care to reverse the trends of increasing
  chronic disease - both of the body and the mind- will be realized. Population health
  shifts can start to relieve the immense burden of chronic disease on individuals,
  families, and society as a whole. It’s the ultimate challenge, but a battle worth
  fighting, as optimal health is achievable.\n\nThe articles in this gallery come
  from many different perspectives, but they all have one thing in common. They demonstrate
  a passion for the work and evidence that thoughtful perseverance and creative intent
  will enable digital transformation in healthcare. We can make this business much
  better at supporting the sacred relationship between healthcare provider and patient,
  which is at the heart of medicine and all that we do."
