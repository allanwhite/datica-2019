:summary: Jacob Behrens, MD describes what is truly holding healthcare back from innovation
  and what needs to change for the best healthcare we can provide to everyone.
:lead: As a physician previously employed by a large healthcare system, I witnessed
  firsthand the complicated motives of various providers, admins, staff, and departments
  vying for unique needs. Lost were the individual needs of patients, staff, and physicians.
  To survive, I had to adapt and create various workflow efficiencies and tools to
  keep up with the ever-changing patient/physician relationship and documentation
  needs. My office became my laboratory for experimenting with digital patient engagement
  and documentation tools out of pure necessity. Unfortunately, I quickly realized
  the numerous restrictions limiting such small-scale innovation. Without change or
  progress, I saw previously motivated physicians give up, burn out, and let their
  ideas die.
:post: "Now having created a new practice model for ADHD in working professionals
  outside of the limitations of general insurance, I have a much more personal and
  powerful role in shaping the technology and designing the products I need. Instead
  of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for consultants to do it, I'm bootstrapping
  different technologies for things such as online patient scheduling, electronic
  health records, electronic prescribing, telehealth capabilities, and patient engagement
  and outcome tracking tools.   \n\nInnovation does not come from looking down the
  street to the next hospital or clinic. Taking a page out Fred Lee’s “If Disney Ran
  Your Hospital: 9 ½ Things You’d Do Differently,” I am now able to look towards other
  customer service fields for ideas. Playing with various online scheduling, videoconferencing,
  database management, and reporting systems, I quickly learned that the most robust
  and best solutions were developed outside the healthcare industry, from hair salons
  and dentist offices to banks and Fortune 500 companies.  \n\nAs my Envision ADHD
  patients choose to go outside of their general insurance to see me, I need to innovate
  and bring a worthy experience. And I’ve found patients eager to provide feedback
  which makes them feel they have a crucial part in shaping their care delivery.  \n\nI
  realize that not every health system can experiment like we do. But whether you
  are working at a small mental health clinic or a major metropolitan hospital system,
  some level of physician-lead innovation is crucial to job satisfaction and to fuel
  future improvements in patient care. \n\nSo what is holding healthcare back from
  innovation?\n\nOne problem is that physicians are now predominantly employees, no
  longer involved in contracts or larger decisions and merely cogs in an ever growing
  machine. Early stage healthcare technology companies are initially eager for physician
  feedback and involvement, but once a large contract is signed the emphasis understandably
  shifts towards the customer (the healthcare institution signing the check) and away
  from the actual user (the physician/staff). When we check ourselves out of being
  a customer, we lose our voice.   \n\nAnother problem is that the economics of sunk
  costs are not well understood. Hospital systems all purchased expensive electronic
  health records from large vendors, and they are wary of bringing in new ideas from
  small start-ups. The general mentality is that we’ve already spent so much, we can't
  change now, but it's ultimately much costlier to implement changes into the health
  record system, compared with building it first on the outside and then folding it
  in.\n\nOur fear of security is probably the key challenge that holds us back. Yet
  the banking industry is light years ahead of us in using technology. We require
  high levels of security because healthcare records get targeted for identity theft.
  \n\nI would argue that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act must
  be changed to allow for innovation. HIPAA sets the standard for protecting sensitive
  patient data, but it’s a loose set of regulations that drives up the cost of anything
  IT related because of the risk of penalties if someone finds that a piece of paper
  wasn't signed. We need to have standards for exactly what HIPAA-compliant means
  so we can focus on the actual security and less about paper trails. \n\nThe general
  conception in the public is that there is a single health record, but there is no
  one common way to view a person's information. Some of the best examples are at
  universities where students can swipe an ID card and all their information is brought
  up for them. There are projects in the works in some states to try that for Medicaid
  programs, but why are we experimenting on the most vulnerable populations?\n\nWe
  often try things out on the vulnerable populations, the veterans, the homeless,
  the under-insured, those in poverty who don't have a choice to have a good care.
  We take a lot of federal and tax dollars to be able to do that. \n\nBut I’ve found
  that a lot of innovation is coming from experimenting on the rich. We should build
  a universal network where rich people can control the management and transmission
  of their health record and take it wherever they want to go. And they would pay
  for this project. Obviously, we're not going to build the perfect product right
  away, it will go through iterations, but once you get it right, then you take taxpayer
  dollars and build it out.\n\nThe rich are like the canary in the coal mine, showing
  us where things are going. There are now direct primary care models completely outside
  of insurance and people pay monthly amounts just to have increased access. People
  are opting out of Medicare and Medicaid because they are starting to find out that
  22 signatures for one patient is just not worth it.\n\nThere are doctors in Silicon
  Valley whose patients are heads of the tech industry, and they operate in cash only.
  They pay to not use health record systems because they know those get targeted by
  identity thieves.\n\nWe should be looking at what people do with their care when
  they can afford anything they want, and know about technology better than anybody
  else. And we should work with them to experiment like crazy, to make sure the best
  innovations lead to the best healthcare we can provide to everyone."
