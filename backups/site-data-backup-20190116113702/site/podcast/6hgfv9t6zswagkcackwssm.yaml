:summary: We didn’t begin seeing the Clinical Transformation Officer role within healthcare
  in wide numbers until around 2014. Possibly this is due, in part, to the multi-disciplinary
  domain of digital health becoming widely viewed as providing an avenue for transforming
  healthcare at the same time. Today’s podcast with Ocshner’s Clinical Transformation
  Officer Dr. Richard Milani takes even those with limited knowledge of the role and
  provides context into how this role fits within the ecosystem of healthcare innovation.
  Datica's Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, sat down with Dr. Milani while in New
  Orleans to speak at the HL7 Partners in Interoperability Summit, and visited with
  him to learn more about the innovations that Ocshner is delivering—and how this
  health system views clinical transformation.
:key_takeaways: |-
  1. Learn what a Clinical Transformation Officer is and more on this unique role in healthcare
  2. Discover where the greatest cost of care is in the U.S. health system and how Ocshner is addressing it
  3. Get an inside view of why vendors’ pilot pitches fail and why some succeed
  4. Hear what has been added to the triple aim to bring it up to the quadruple aim
:post: |-
  ### Dr. Milani responds:

  **On why health systems are adding Clinical Transformation Officers:** "We realize and recognize that we have to transform ourselves in order to be more cost-effective and achieve better quality outcomes — not only the U.S. but across the world.

  Their sole purpose is to be able to ready health systems for the needed transformation that is coming."

  **On value-based care:** "I think that it is the best thing that could happen for people, because at the end of the day you want to see a physician or go to a hospital that's going to deliver high value, high quality, safe care, in the most efficient way possible for you so you can get what you need done, get out safely and not have problems that occur, or repeat hospitalizations for whatever procedure you might have had."

    </a>
  </p>

  **On the largest constraints for delivery of new innovations:** "The biggest constraints are always going to be culture. We have to appeal to what is best for our customers and in this case patients are our customers; that generally helps things along. But typically the greatest difficulty you will have is culture and moving culture around.

  **On how the Ocshner innovation team works with the IT department:** "We are independent but we are close in terms of not interfering with the day-to-day job that they have to perform, which is to keep the trains running on time. They need to make sure that our EMR is up-to-date, operational, safe, effective, secure and those are critically important functions. We work side by side with them."

  **On the vendor approach that doesn’t align with a health system:** "What doesn't work is if a vendor is just purely just trying to sell their product and they are not interested ultimately in making this frictionless."

  > I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability.

  **On the state of interoperability:** "I see vendors and systems coming together much more collegially than in the past and clearly and has demonstrated the real significant impact of interoperability. Having the information in one location where we can now categorize and do all kinds of things with that information to interact with the patient at the right moment, at the right time, and at the right place is critical for us."

  **On Ocshner’s transformation focus:** "Our mantra has always been the quadruple aim. Anything that we do from an innovation perspective tries to target at least one, if not all the principles of the quadruple aim, which is namely improving the health of the population, improving the quality of the care that we provide, reducing the costs of care for our population and finally, the fourth aim is now — how can we do this while improving the workload on the providers of care."

  **On ideas for clinicians and informaticists working at startups:** "Clearly, for any startup in the healthcare sector, it's going to be difficult for you to be able to sell whatever product you have, unless you have some real-world data and outcomes based on that data. I think it would be very important for any of these small startups to develop relationships with delivery systems to say: We've got this idea. Do you think this has legs? Not only to test it out, but to get advice and feedback. We provide counsel to a lot of small startups. Sometimes the way they imagine healthcare delivery to be is somewhat different than it really is."

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
