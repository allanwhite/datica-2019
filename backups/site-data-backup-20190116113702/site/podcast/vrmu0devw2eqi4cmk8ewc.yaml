:summary: When we look at a more connected healthcare system, few see it as clearly
  as Joseph Kvedar, MD, author of _The Internet of Healthy Things_. In this podcast,
  he reveals which pieces of the healthcare industry have embraced connected health
  and which will have to be dragged to the party. Getting insights from Dr. Kvedar
  is like Googling the future of healthcare.
:key_takeaways: "1. Discover which industry participants are embracing a more connected
  healthcare and which are not\n2. Learn why raw numbers don’t motivate a lifestyle
  change for some segments of the population \n3. Understand why societal changes
  will be the most difficult barrier to connected health\n4. Explore why feedback
  loops are fairly weak motivators "
:post: "***Dr. Kvedar responds:***\n\n**On connected health and who will be last to
  board the train:** \"The slowest to come on board from a business model perspective
  are docs and hospitals because we are used to making a living by taking care of
  sick people – we haven't quite figured out how to reward clinicians for keeping
  you well and how to reward hospitals for keeping you out of hospitals.\" \n\n\"As
  I said earlier, doctors and hospitals are going to be dragged along to the party
  without question. Health plans, pharmacy, pharmaceuticals, and other industries
  are getting in ahead of the curve because they have more to gain in the short term.
  It's happening – doctors and hospitals are very slow to change.\"\n\n**On the current
  state of digital health:** \"Digital health is now adopted by more than 50% of U.S.
  citizens or something like that. While we are trying to celebrate the consumerization
  and the adoption... there is still a very significant chunk of folks — most of them
  with chronic illness who cost the system a lot of money — who are reticent.\"\n\n<a
  href=\"http://theinternetofhealthythings.com/\" title=\"Kvedar, 'The Internet of
  Healthy Things' book\"><img class=\"float-left\" width=\"140\" src=\"//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/6GIXXP3OdUQa26AOCS4WaI/7905a56020707fd8d2c8496d2fb5fba0/Kvedar___22The_Internet_of_Healthy_Things_22_book_cover.jpg\"
  alt=\"Kvedar, 'The Internet of Healthy Things' book cover\" ></a>\n\n**On the biggest
  impediments to interoperability:** \"Sadly, it is in no one’s financial best interests.\"\n\n\"If
  you are an IT vendor – almost all of them up and down the stack, whether it's telecom,
  database, or even hardware – all of them want to bring you in and upsell you new
  things. They can only upsell you if they build barriers to others entering their
  space and that means that they are doing something proprietary to keep you as a
  customer. Almost always that involves some sort of unique dataset or some sort of
  unique way of sharing data. On the vendor side, it seems hopeless.\"\n\n\"On the
  hospital side, from a pure business perspective, why would my hospital want to make
  it easy for patients to take their data to another hospital and get their care done
  there? To implement interoperability costs a lot of money. You have to build interfaces
  and interfaces are complicated.\"\n\n**On what will get us to interoperable healthcare:**
  \"The only way I could conceive of having interoperability become the norm is to
  have a demand from government purchasers that – if you are going to be a government
  contract – you have to have a certain set of open standards. I don’t know if that
  will happen under a Trump administration but they certainly are signaling that they
  wouldn't view the world that way. So, I don't see it happening soon, unfortunately.\"\n\n**On
  retail and its guiding light to healthcare:** \"Other examples have come up that
  I think are equally interesting, such as, if you buy an item from J.Crew online
  and, if you have their app on your phone, go into their mall store, the app will
  signal you to go to a table that has matching accessories to the thing that you
  bought online. A very interesting application.\" \n\n**On the wearable market downturn:**
  \"I think one of the reasons we are seeing a slump in the market is that there's
  a shiny new toy aspect to any new technology and we've gone through that phase with
  many wearables.\"\n\n![Kvedar, 'The Internet of Healthy Things' Symposium presentation](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2k2LHgR8XaqKusSaUeeE0y/d2248f2baeaaad82c8562c9162c7f5f5/Kvedar___22The_Internet_of_Healthy_Things_22_Symposium_presentation.jpg)\n\n\"[Wearables]
  largely were designed by engineers for engineers, and by quantitative people for
  quantitative people. I fell in love with all of them initially. A friend of mine
  who is not a quantitative person pointed out to me that a big part of our population
  doesn’t care about numbers. They care about other things. So if you are not a quantitative
  person, or you are not particularly motivated to change whatever the feedback loop
  is sending your way, it quickly becomes background noise.\"\n\n**On the future of
  the wearable market:** \"The good news is that there's a crop of devices coming
  out now in the wearables space that give insights rather than just numbers... They
  are all very exciting and we are going to look forward to a rebound in the space
  because people will be much more responsive to insights rather than just numbers.\"\n\n**On
  artificial intelligence in healthcare:** \"If you call it decision support, maybe
  you can sell it. Artificial Intelligence sounds scary. It sounds like you are trying
  to take my job away from me, so I think it is in how you frame it.\""
