:summary: Few in healthcare have as much innovation experience as does Dr. Naomi Fried.
  As you listen to this month’s podcast that features a chat between Dr. Fried and
  host Travis Good, MD, you’ll discover the differences between the way pharma and
  a hospital system innovates, as well as what digital health may add to pharma in
  the future.
:key_takeaways: "1. Learn why pharma companies are slower to innovate and what could
  help them move faster \n2. Discover how pharma may use digital health solutions
  in the future\n3. Understand what digiceuticals are and how they may alter or supplement
  drug therapies\n4. Explore ways in which hospital strategy and pharma strategy to
  digital health differ"
:post: "### Dr. Fried responds:\n\n*On how pharma and a hospital might think differently
  about innovation:* “From a pharma perspective, innovation is actually a core competency
  for them. Hospitals, on the other hand, see their core business as care delivery,
  taking care of patients.”\n“I would summarize pharma's approach to internal non-product
  innovation as slow and cautious. Culturally, I think there are many in pharma that
  want to continue to do things the way they've been doing them, historically. So,
  there are some barriers to overcome there.”\n\n“Compared to pharma providers, [providers]
  tend to have fewer resources to put toward internal innovation. But I think when
  it comes to testing and implementing patient-facing innovations, particularly new
  digital health tools, I think providers generally move more quickly. They are closer
  to the patient. They have fewer regulatory barriers to navigate around. So they
  tend to be more likely to jump in and try things. I'd say when it comes to digital
  health innovation for patients, hospitals are probably actually a bit ahead of pharma.”\n\n*On
  how pharma views internal versus external innovation:* “[Digital health] companies
  usually have specialized domain knowledge. They've built a specific digital health
  tool and when you look at tech-savvy, entrepreneurial start-ups, they tend to have
  a consumer bent and typically better at developing the type of user experience and
  consumer-oriented solution than large pharma companies.”\n\n“The second real benefit
  to partnering with external companies around digital health innovation is that these
  start-up companies tend to be more nimble because they are small in size, much simpler
  organizationally speaking than large pharma. Digital health startups in small companies
  generally move more quickly and often develop products in months rather than years,
  and they can also make changes quickly and respond to feedback they get.”\n\n*On
  benefits for pharma in using digital health companies to innovate faster:* “There's
  a whole body of rules for how pharma is permitted to interact with patients, especially
  stringent rules outside of the U.S., and these rules simply don't apply to digital
  health companies. An external digital health vendor can talk freely to a doctor
  and patient and I think this is beneficial when trying to develop new innovative
  solutions that'll touch the patient.\n\n*On benefits for digital health companies
  who work with pharma companies:* “I think hospitals are good potential customers
  for some of the digital health startups, but I think pharma actually can do a lot
  in terms of partnership, beyond the obvious resources like money. I think pharma
  can help digital health startups by sharing some of the expertise and understanding
  they have in particular diseases and therapeutic areas.”\n\n“Digital health startups
  can leverage and learn from pharma's well-established processes around health care
  industry-specific details, and that includes things like CPT coding, thinking about
  payer reimbursement. I think for start-ups, they don't have to reinvent the wheel
  or invest heavily in developing regulatory expertise, but really can look to a pharma
  partner who can help them leapfrog to where they are going.”\n\n“Where start-ups
  lack infrastructure needed to reach customers and have trouble scaling up, this
  is something that pharmaceutical companies have done well, so I think that teaming
  with pharmaceutical companies, tapping into their extensive marketing infrastructures
  and distribution channels can really help digital start-ups get traction, much faster
  than they could if they were on their own.” \n\n*On whether pharma will soon provide
  medication plus digital health solutions:* “I think in the end, pharma will continue
  to provide solutions to patients, at the core, there will be a medication or a therapy.
  But almost all of these medications in the future will be combined with digital
  health solutions that address a patient’s needs more comprehensively. I think these
  digital solutions will address side effects; they will help with medication adherence.”\n\n*On
  examples of medication + digital health solutions:* “In the future, I think we'll
  see drugs being offered along with virtual care, platforms and tools. Drugs for
  congestive heart failure, for example might come with home monitoring, so that it
  is possible to track the impact of the drug and keep a patient from retaining fluid
  that might necessitate a trip to the emergency department. You won't just be getting
  a drug, but getting a drug plus a service that helps track how you are doing.”\n\n“I
  think we'll also see drugs plus digital therapies for side effects. As an example,
  multiple sclerosis drugs might come with digital antidepressant, an app or a web-based
  solution that helps them manage or ideally even treat the depression that is so
  common in that patient population.”\n\n“Another example that I think we'll be seeing
  are wearables that will help a patient know actually when they need to take their
  drug. Epileptic drugs might come with a wearable when an attack might be eminent
  and the patient can get someplace safe and take a drug to hopefully ward off that
  attack.”\n\n“I like to call it D and D — drugs and digital. At the core, pharma
  will still be our source for medications but I think what we think of in terms of
  patient solutions and value to patients will be much more than just the chemical
  compound.”"

    There are many types of environments, including physical, virtualized, and cloud, that a healthcare IT department or service provider might maintain in a compliant fashion. A large portion of service providers in today’s age provide their services to customers utilizing the cloud model. In a public cloud, the infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group that is owned by the HIPAA cloud company. The public cloud infrastructure exists solely on the premise of the cloud provider.

    Being on the cloud is critical today, and critical for the future.

    Healthcare Cloud is a Means to Manage More Data\nHealthcare today is increasingly
    data-driven and demands to share that data are also increasing. Those trends translate
    to considerable amounts of data that must be processed and stored in a secure
    and scalable manner. Healthcare cloud provides the means to handle the massive
    amounts of data that are growing exponentially in a cost-efficient manner. \n\n###
    Healthcare Cloud Enables Value-Based Care\nHealthcare cloud computing is the most
    feasible way for healthcare systems, hospitals, and digital health vendors to
    face the challenge of delivering more patient value. It provides them with a connected
    environment to exchange data with their patients. On-premise infrastructure costs
    are high and data scalability is more feasible in the cloud.\n\n## Why is HIPAA
    Compliance in the Cloud Important?\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability act, was signed into legislation back in the 90s.
    These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach that set out to improve
    the health insurance system. If you have a healthcare application, website or
    data storage, you must be in complete compliance, including HIPAA cloud hosting.

    What is HIPAA compliant hosting and what does that mean?\nHIPAA hosting (cloud)
    is data hosting that complies with all aspects of HIPAA’s physical safeguard requirements.
    Application developers especially must recognize that HIPAA compliant hosting
    is necessary for their solutions.\n\nCompliance in the cloud is possible in any
    scenario as long as it addresses controls in the main five HIPAA Omnibus categories:\n\n*
    Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)\n* Physical Safeguards (§ 164.310)\n* Technical
    Safeguards (§ 164.312)\n* Organizational Safeguards (§ 164.314)\n* Policies and
    Procedures and Documentation Safeguards (§ 164.316)\n\nAs well as additional security
    provisions within References 13402 of the HITECH Act.\n\n## Healthcare Cloud Security\nThe
    healthcare industry has been shifting toward a value-based care delivery model,
    partially enabled by open standards that support cooperative, collaborative workflows.
    Services delivered by cloud computing will evolve to support a wide variety of
    healthcare processes while providing an infrastructure that allows healthcare
    entities to utilize resources at fractional costs. \n\nHealthcare professionals
    understand that cloud computing has its advantages but many have data security
    concerns about moving to a cloud-based system. Patient privacy and data security
    are considered the most serious considerations in cloud computing. \n\n<div class=\"callout

    Is Data Encryption Required by HIPAA?\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) is a set of regulations that were enacted as a multi-tiered approach
    to improving the health insurance system. HIPAA has specifications that ensure
    the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information. Many wonder if
    encryption is required by HIPAA but, because these regulations are so convoluted,
    it’s hard to determine. \n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule does not explicitly say that
    encryption of data at rest or in transit is required. Since this specification
    is classified as “addressable” the HHS believes that an entity must address encryption
    when seen as “reasonable and appropriate.” Let’s break down what that means:\n\n*
    The HHS is saying that you do not have to encrypt your data but you need to be
    prepared to state why you believe that in writing because if you are audited,
    your documentation will be reviewed by the OCR (Office for Civil Rights).\n* If
    an entity does a proper risk analysis, there are minimal scenarios in which encryption
    is not “reasonable and appropriate.”\n* Upon a breach of data happening, it is
    not very likely the victim(s) or the OCR will agree with any entity claiming that
    it not necessary. So although encryption may not be called out as a mandatory,
    the majority of healthcare professionals will tell that it is required.\n\n\n##
    How do I Choose a Secure Healthcare Cloud?\nWhen selecting a healthcare cloud
    provider, it is vital for an organization to perform due diligence to ensure the
    ePHI they are entrusting this provider with will be secured in accordance with
    the HIPAA regulations.\n\nAs you look for a [compliant healthcare cloud](https://datica.com/platform/)
    ask these key questions:\n* Have they had an external assessment done by a third
    party?\n* Have they been assessed against the HIPAA Security Rule?\n* What assurance
    can they make in safeguarding your data?\n* What do they cover as part of the
    business associate agreement?\n\nIn most instances, cloud providers should be
    able to provide evidence of a third party HIPAA compliance assessment, such as
    HITRUST CSF certification.\n\nDatica makes digital health in the cloud a reality
    by removing the risks that prevent its adoption. We turn HIPAA compliance on public
    infrastructure providers into a solved problem, and enable secure clinical data
    exchange between mission-critical digital health applications and EHR systems.
    Datica serves healthcare’s complete spectrum, from digital health startups and
    industry leaders to health systems across the nation. More than 300 customers
    and partners trust Datica to ensure their clouds are HITRUST certified and data
    securely interoperable.\n\n"
