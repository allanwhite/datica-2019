  :description: FHIR is the latest standard to be developed under the HL7 organization.
    Pronounced 'Fire' , FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
    I think it's the most interesting standard to have come out of HL7 since the original
    HL7 protocol.

:summary: '*The Healthcare Innovators Podcast* is proud to connect you with Grahame
  Grieve, Product Director of FHIR for HL7. Grahame hails from Melbourne, Australia
  and has come to be industry known as the "Father of FHIR." Before creating the Fast
  Healthcare Interoperability Resources, he spent years working with the HL7 standards
  that assist in transferring clinical and administrative data between software applications.
  Today, we''ll learn a bit more about the background of FHIR and why healthcare subdomains
  are attracted to the FHIR standard. This is first in a three-part interview series
  around the FHIR standard and one that will leave you laughing as Grieve shares his
  favorite answer to what FHIR stands for. '
:key_takeaways: |-
  1. Discover what potential healthcare requirement would force everyone to re-engineer their interfaces
  2. Learn the architectural advantage of FHIR versus other data exchange standards
  3. Understand Grahame's thoughts around open-source and its importance
  4. Discover the unrealized dream for FHIR and why Grahame wants to eventually come back to it
:post: |-
  **On which subdomain is expressing the most Interest:** "The one that is getting the most focus and attraction right now is EHRs. We have projects in multiple countries, particularly in the USA, to provide open EHR access to data. That's primarily the highest profile work that we have going, but everybody's working relatively hard."

  **On the origin of naming FHIR:** "I'm very happy to say it wasn't my idea. Once it became clear that we had a working standard, I just called resources for help because I'm a boring kind of techie geek. I just called it what it was. Then the marketing committee at HL7 looked at it and said, 'if you want this to be a big deal, you've got to give it a funny name, so people can play with the name.' They banged it around and came up with the FHIR name."

  **On a favorite FHIR acronym twist:** "I've heard them all, but there are always new ones, as well as puns on the FHIR as part of the name. There's also a whole series of jokes around what the latest F-H-I-R actually stands for. My personal favorite is: 'Fixing HL7's International Reputation'."

  **On FHIR current pilots: ** "At the moment, we have prototypes and pilot projects in many countries in the world, in many domains. Some are high profile projects; some are under the radar projects. My focus is now on scaling up the community, because that's where our focus needs to be, because we are getting more and more implementations. In the next five years, FHIR will transition from being the next greatest thing to what everybody does, and becoming boring, in fact."

  **On the advantage of FHIR:** "One of the architectural advantages of FHIR versus other healthcare data exchange processes is that we leverage the Web."

  **On high-profile hacks: ** "Given the number of high profile identity hacks we've had this year, and those are only the reported ones, I think that we should stop assuming that there is any security around people's fundamental identification and the same should apply to their health. Instead of regarding that as necessary to secure, I think society will be forced to move to a world where everybody's information is open, and the social consequences aren't there."

  **On open-sourcing FHIR:**

  * "Health information should be free — free to move." " ...giving your information away increases its value."
  * "If you hold onto it and try to extract money out of its use, you're actually decreasing the value."
  * "I've become a strident believer in the value of open source for at least the area that we work in. There are a few other specifications providers who are moving away from any form of openness, getting more and more restrictive, insisting that we must pay them or they'll aggressively prosecute. I look at that and say, "I don't know why you would spend so much time decreasing your value."

  **On how much interoperability you need:** "I have a formula: How much interoperability do you need?  The answer is *n* times two, where 'n' is the amount you have."

  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."
