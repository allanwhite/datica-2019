  :description: FHIR is the latest standard to be developed under the HL7 organization.
    Pronounced 'Fire' , FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources.
    I think it's the most interesting standard to have come out of HL7 since the original
    HL7 protocol.

:summary: Our guest in this episode is Joshua Mandel, MD, who is both a physician
  and software developer. With Mark Olshchesky as host, Dr. Mandel dives into SMART
  on FHIR and the widespread adoption of Clinical Decision Support. Dr. Mandel shares
  his experience as a technical architect for the [SMART project](http://smartplatforms.org/)
  organized by Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, as well as specific
  projects that are making a difference to clinicians and healthcare.
:key_takeaways: "\n1. Learn how SMART on FHIR enables clinical decision support (CDS)
  tools\n2. Discover action steps to support CDS advancement \n3. Hear how clinicians
  can leverage good technology without pain points\n4. Identify new technologies advancing
  CDS workflows"
:post: "### Dr. Mandel responds:\n\n**On defining SMART:** \"SMART is an acronym that
  stands for Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology. This idea
  of substitutability was the key focus. The idea, whether it was a patient or a clinician
  should be able to pick the apps that they want to use and interact with healthcare
  data using those apps.\" \n\n**On helping developers build SMART-enabled apps:**
  \"At [docs.SMARTHealth.org](http://docs.smarthealth.org), we describe how to get
  started building  a browser-based app. You could even take a set of sample code
  that runs right in the browser, tweak it, write some new FHIR queries and get started
  writing code without having to download or installing packages locally.\"\n\n**On
  the benefits of SMART on FHIR:** \"SMART provides a way to embed these apps directly
  inside either an EHR or a patient portal, so that when you are in the middle of
  a clinical workflow, you can pick and choose the tools that you want to use, without
  having to sign into another system.\"\n\n**On alerts for clinical workflows:** \"Alerts
  are often incorporated into an EHR as a way to enforce a policy but not necessarily
  a way of enhancing a clinical workflow or clinical decisions. So, I think that alerts,
  in general, have a bad rap for good reasons.\"\n\n**On the pushing standards forward:**
  \"The best kind of arrangement that we have to push these standards forward is what
  I call a triad, where there is a hospital system that is interested in adopting
  a CDS product in the context of their EHR. If we can get all three of those together,
  that is by far the best way for us to develop a new feature in a specification like
  CDS Hooks.\" \n\n**On preparation for CDS:** \"Make an early investment in FHIR
  and make sure that basic data types like medications, allergies and lab tests are
  available through a FHIR interface.\" \n\n**On CDS and what it _really_ means:**
  \"Clinical decision support is a bit of a jargon-y term. What we really mean is
  third-party services, such as helpful contextual information, for clinicians while
  they are going through their daily workflow.\" "
