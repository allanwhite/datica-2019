  __On why the U.S. health system feels like a casino:__ “We don't really know what it is going to cost. We don't know what the diagnosis will be. We don't know what the outcome will be. And even beyond these big risks, there is clinical evidence that many of the most expensive conditions to treat, ones like cancer, are the ones that are the result of totally random cell mutation. That happens about 66% of the time.”

  __On whether a universal or national patient identifier is on the horizon:__ “Yeah, there's no system that is perfectly safe but we can do a lot better than social security numbers in the status quo. Other countries are already doing this today. In my own view, patient safety should always trump consumer ignorance of this issue, but it often doesn't. Most consumers don't understand the risk at all because they don't have to access these systems. But about 10 to 14 percent of medical errors are the result of mismatched patient identification.”

  “I think we are headed towards an inevitability of patient identification and I also think that it's going to need to be a government mandate, in much the same way that the government mandates things like vehicle identification numbers, the government mandated AC outlets. The government mandates train track gauges for these very reasons, because there's a safety component to each of those and that's the same thing we are going to come across with healthcare.”

  __On how dire the patient matching statistics have become:__ “Very acute. In fact the statistics I saw are that within a hospital system, patient matching using algorithms and other current techniques can really get the accuracy to a pretty high level in the mid to high 90s. The problem occurs rapidly when you try and share that data outside of the hospital and in those cases where data is being shared outside of the hospital, patient matching accuracy drops into the low 50s to 60 percent.”

  __On the history and political aspects of the national patient identifier:__ “In fact the interesting history to it is that a national patient identifier was actually baked into the first iteration of HIPAA, which is portability. So there were two components of HIPAA that are often forgotten. The first is that it was designed to create a national provider identifier and it was also tasked to create a national patient identifier. We kept the provider identifier and in fact that's still in use today. So we have a national provider identifier but for political and financial reasons, it was deemed to be too sensitive to create a national patient identifier. So they punted on funding that.”

  __On the difference between “universal healthcare” and “universal coverage:__  “We tend to lump the phrase in with medicare for all, single payer and universal healthcare. The reality is it is distinctly separate. Universal coverage is the right term and is the term that is identified by the World Health Organization. Their definition is pretty good, which is that all people have access to preventative, curative and rehabilitative health services of sufficient quality to be effective while also ensuring that people do not suffer financial hardship when paying for these services. That's in a nutshell. Now, how you pay for that is what the debate ahead is focused on.”

  __On why the U.S. has a tiered system for healthcare payments:__ “If you think about it, the tiering starts with age. We tier by age twice, by age 26 and age 65. We also tier by employment — employer-sponsored insurance. We tier by military service, which is the VA. We tier by heritage, which is the Indian Health Services. We tier by income, which is Medicaid. So we have all these tiers of coverage and even after all those tiers, we still wind up with about 10 percent of the American population that are concerned uninsured. We have eight tiers and then some smaller tiers on top of those and you have to ask yourself, so why do we do this tiering? The only reason that we do tiering in the sense of coverage is to support tiered pricing. It's the tiered pricing is really at the heart of a system that has been optimized for revenue and profits and not safety and quality.”

  :body: "## What is HIPAA?\n\nHIPAA, formally known as the Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability act, was signed into legislation in the United States in the
    90's. These regulations were enacted as a multi-tiered approach to improve the
    health insurance system. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule created the first
    national standard to protect personal health information and medical records.\n\n<div

    HIPAA permits individuals to have power over their own health information.\n*
    HIPAA holds any perpetrators fully accountable for their actions if in violation.\n*
    HIPAA creates the necessary safeguards that all healthcare entities must attain
    to handle personal health information.\n* HIPAA sets parameters around the use
    and distribution of health data.\n\n## Why does HIPAA matter? \nWell, all healthcare
    entities and organizations that use, store, maintain or transmit patient health
    information are expected to be in complete compliance with the regulations of
    the HIPAA law. When completely adhered to, HIPAA regulations not only ensure privacy,
    reduce fraudulent activity and improve data systems but are estimated to save
    providers billions of dollars annually. By knowing of and preventing security
    risks that could result in major compliance costs, organizations are able to focus
    on growing their profits instead of fearing these potential audit fines.\n\n##
    What is PHI or ePHI?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop discover--body-callout float-right-on-medium\"

    [HIPAA and Data Breaches](https://datica-2019.netlify.app/academy/hipaa-and-data-breaches/)\n\n</div>\n\nProtected
    health information (PHI) is any information about health status, provision of
    health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual
    and is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium by a covered entity or
    its business associate.\nThe definition of a business associate has been extended
    with the HIPAA Omnibus rule that went into effect in 2013. The term “information”
    is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of a patient’s medical record
    or payment history. The key here is this phrase “that can be linked to a specific
    individual,” which is where the other acronym, PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
    becomes relevant. The major difference between PHI and PII is that PII is a legal
    definition, i.e. PII is anything that could be used to uniquely identify an individual.
    PHI is a subset of PII in that a medical record could be used to identify a person
    — especially if the disease or condition is rare enough.\n\n## Understand Business

    HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and
    entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories
    are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and
    providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest
    cohort of cloud computing companies.\nBusiness associates are people or organizations
    who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the
    process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates
    handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business
    associates are required to sign what’s called a business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n##

    can, and many companies do, put “HIPAA Compliant” on their websites and marketing
    material. Complying with HIPAA is essential to selling software that processes,
    stores, transmits, or somehow touches ePHI. It’s an essential, though non-differentiating,
    feature of any B2B healthcare technology product. The reason companies can self-attest
    to being HIPAA compliant is that there isn’t a certifying body, or accompanying
    certification, for HIPAA. That’s problematic for both vendors making and selling
    healthcare software to enterprises and enterprises buying software from third
    party vendors.\n\n### 3 Ways to Prove HIPAA Compliance\nTo prove HIPAA Compliance,
    one of three methods is used: self assessments, full third party audits, or inheriting
    proof. \n\n#### Path 1: Self Assessments\nSelf assessments are the easiest and
    least expensive, at least in terms of direct costs, to show\ncompliance with HIPAA.
    Without official audit reports, you must illustrate your compliance story\nthrough
    hand-crafted documentation.\n\nWe created this [compliance self-assessment worksheet](https://content.datica.com/hipaa-hitrust-self-assessment)
    to get you started on your roadmap to compliance. \n\n#### Path 2: Full Third-Party
    Audits\nWhile you may still have to answer questions from each customer about
    security and compliance, providing your third party audit reports will go a long
    way to circumventing long, drawn-out security and compliance reviews. Broadly
    speaking, there are two main healthcare compliance frameworks that you can be
    audited against – HIPAA (from HHS) and HITRUST.\n\n#### Path 3: Middle Road —
    Inheriting Proof\nDatica was built to create Path 3. There had to be an easier
    way to build modern healthcare technology,\npractice modern development practices,
    comply with HIPAA without having to hire a compliance expert and prove compliance
    with HIPAA without doing a full audit.\n\nLearn more about HIPAA compliance from
    the resources listed on this page, or contact the compliance experts at Datica."
