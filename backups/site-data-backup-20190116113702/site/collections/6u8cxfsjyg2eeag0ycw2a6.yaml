  :summary: HIPAA outlines the types of entities that are covered but the further
    down the line a subcontractor gets from a covered entity, the more confusion there
    is.
  :blog_lead: "The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered
    by [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) and entities that have
    to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses,
    covered entities (CEs), and business associates. The further down the line the
    subcontractor gets from the covered entity, the more confusion there is about
    who really is a business associate and who needs to sign a business associate
    agreement. \n"
  :post: "\n## Who is a Business Associate?\n\nTo put it very simply, a business associate
    is a person or organization who interacts with PHI from a covered entity or another
    business associate. \n\nMore specifically, in the process of providing services
    or technology to either a covered entity (for example, a hospital) or another
    business associate as a subcontractor (such as a PaaS provider like Datica), business
    associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this PHI
    access, all business associates are required to sign what’s called a [business
    associate agreement (BAA)](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/).
    The BAA is a legal contract that describes how the business associate adheres
    to HIPAA along with the responsibilities and risks they take on. \n\nThe BAA also
    typically defines the services that the business associate is providing, the type
    of data they are interacting with, and addresses areas around breach notifications
    (such as timelines), and penalties.\n\n## If I’m a Subcontracted Developer, Whose
    BAA do I sign? \n\nThings got a lot more confusing when the HITECH HIPAA Omnibus
    Rule in 2013 expanded the simple earlier definition of business associate to include
    something called subcontractors. Subcontractors, like a software developer or
    hosting provider, are typically service or technology organizations that provide
    additional services to the business associates, which are providing services for
    the covered entities. \n\n### Think of it a chain of trust\n\nIt’s like a chain
    that follows the PHI from the very first link of the chain which is the covered
    entity. The next link would be the business associate and all of their subcontractors
    (also business associates) would be links that follow. Think of subcontractors
    as business associates of business associates. The BAA follows the direct path
    of the chain. So, a covered entity is not required to sign a BAA with their business
    associates’ subcontractors, but the business associate is.\n\nEach party in the
    chain is required by [regulation and by contract](https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_1301_hipaa_christiansen.html)
    to protect the PHI and administer it consistently with the obligations of the
    covered entity at the top of the chain. So, for example, if a covered entity is
    a hospital and that hospital has a breach notification of 24 hours, every link
    (or business associate) of that chain needs to also specify 24 hour breach notification
    in their BAAs.\n\n## 3 Common Misconceptions\n\nWe talk to development shops and
    vendors who get this wrong all the time. Here are three of the most common mistaken
    beliefs we hear:\n\n1. The vendor in question doesn’t necessarily need to be HIPAA-compliant
    because they aren’t storing data. Even though the vendor claimed they were not
    storing PHI, having data pass through their systems would still require protection
    under HIPAA. A BAA serves as a promise of this.\n2. They are HIPAA-compliant because
    they encrypted the data in transit and in storage. This is certainly crucial,
    but there is so much more to HIPAA than encrypting data. You can read about everything
    we do to be HIPAA-compliant in our [policies](https://datica.com/open-source/policies/).
    At a minimum, a vendor must encrypt data and ensure [physical media meets HIPAA’s
    physical security requirements](https://hipaa.datica.com/#datica-hipaa-compliance).
    As a result, that vendor would need to have a BAA signed with their hosting vendor
    to ensure legitimacy.\n3. The subcontractor doesn’t need to sign a BAA because
    the vendor they’re subcontracting for already has one in place with the covered
    entity. As of 2013, this is false. As soon as PHI passes through your system,
    you are also automatically considered a business associate and the vendor you
    subcontracted with will require a BAA from you. In fact, the latest rules state
    that covered entities MUST ensure they obtain satisfactory assurances from their
    business associates, and they must do the same with their subcontractors, and
    so on, no matter how far “down the chain” the information flows. \n\nThis may
    seem complicated, but don’t forget that the purpose of all of this is to ensure
    that individuals’ health information remains protected by all parties involved."

  :summary: Guess what? HIPAA doesn't say how long you have to keep medical records.
    This is a common misconception of HIPAA data retention policy.
  :blog_lead: 'It may come as a surprise, but you don''t have to retain medical records
    according to [HIPAA rules](https://datica.com/blog/three-hipaa-omnibus-rule-essentials-for-it-security/).
    This is a very common misconception with HIPAA. Medical records means electronic
    protected health information (ePHI) in this case. HIPAA does not have any rules
    that require covered entities or business associates to retain ePHI. I assume
    this is a common question for HHS as they have it listed in a [HIPAA FAQ](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/580/does-hipaa-require-covered-entities-to-keep-medical-records-for-any-period/index.html).

'
  :post: "![Point 6 of HIPAA retention rules](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/646QbbgQqk0oWkeqSuuYMg/d33d3aa0a6d900257741cf80cb628538/blog-main-retention.png)\n\nThe
    confusion likely stems from two things. First, most states have requirements that
    covered entities retain ePHI for a certain period of time, even if the covered
    entity closes its doors; I imagine the most common case of a covered entity closing
    is a physician retiring. As a covered entitiy, the onus is on you to understand
    the requirements in the states that you work in and to comply with them.\n\nThis
    is a case I'm personally exposed to right now as a doc friend is retiring and
    is trying to figure out what to do with his medical records for the next 10 years.
    His records are all paper and he's retiring to avoid having to use an EHR. Yes,
    this does happen and some doctors feel so strongly, in a bad way, about EHRs that
    they are are retiring early to avoid having to change the way they've practiced
    for 30, 40, or even 50 years.\n\nThere are issues that arise when a [business
    associate](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
    such as an EHR company, goes out of business and the covered entity needs to get
    the records and find a way to store them. We've seen this experience too, especially
    in the case of smaller, specialty specific EHRs and practice management systems.
    More on this in another post.\n\nThe second reason for the misconception about
    HIPAA and retention of ePHI is that HIPAA does have data retention rules but,
    oddly enough, they don't apply to ePHI. **Section 164.316(b)(1)** of HIPAA require
    orgs:\n\n> (i) Maintain the policies and procedures implemented to comply with
    this subpart in written (which may be electronic) form; and (ii) if an action,
    activity or assessment is required by this subpart to be documented, maintain
    a written (which may be electronic) record of the action, activity, or assessment.”
    \n\n**Section 164.316(b)(2)(i)** goes on to state:\n\n> Retain the documentation
    required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for 6 years from the date of its
    creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later.”\n\nThere
    are lots of policy and documentation requirements in HIPAA, and the rules around
    data retention apply to those. You should be maintaining all of your policies
    and documentation that address aspects of HIPAA, and you should plan to retain
    it all for 6 years at a minimum. You should also maintain all risk assessments,
    audits, and other documentation related to your organization.\n\n## Datica policy
    and documentation retention\n\nAt Datica we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for
    version control on our policies, and the current versions are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
    and maintained in a Master branch. [More on why we do this in a separate post](https://datica.com/blog/our-company-policies-now-available-free-on-github/).\n\nWe
    backup our current policies using Box. For risk assessments, change and configuration
    management, vulnerability scanning, and audits we also use Box as a repository.
    You can see our current policies here - [policy.datica.com](https://policy.datica.com).\n\n"

  :summary: If you're new to container orchestration and more familiar with a fully
    managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS), Kubernetes can seem complex. Learn the differences
    and tradeoffs.
  :blog_lead: Kubernetes® is dominating in 2018. If you're not already thinking about
    Kubernetes or at least containerization, then you're behind. Fortunately, containers
    and cloud native architectures have never been more accessible or easier to get
    started with. From infrastructure providers like AWS and Azure offering their
    own [versions of managed Kubernetes](https://sysdig.com/blog/ecs-fargate-eks-kubernetes-aws-compared/),
    to organizations like Cloud Foundry offering [Kubernetes services](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/),
    the world is shifting toward containers.
  :post: "\nIf you're working inside of a regulated industry, like healthcare or finance,
    these tools may seem out of reach. The compliance requirements and security restrictions
    of HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, GxP, NIST, PCI, and more can seem like impossible hurdles
    to jump when it comes to adopting a platform like Kubernetes.\nThis is exactly
    why [Datica is shifting toward Kubernetes](https://datica.com/press-release/datica-launches-kubernetes-enabled-platform/).
    Our customers are asking for it, it’s the future of managing workloads born in
    the cloud, and Datica is already the most robust solution for compliance management
    on the planet. \n\nIf you're new to container orchestration and more familiar
    with a fully managed platform, like Heroku or Datica's legacy product, Kubernetes
    can seem complex. The goal of this article is to compare Kubernetes with a traditional
    PaaS, discuss the differences, and examine the tradeoffs.\n\n> Now that the world
    has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools have become ever
    larger and more complex.\n\n## What is a PaaS?\n\nA Platform as a Service, or
    a PaaS is intended to create a layer of abstraction on top of cloud service providers
    (or in some cases data centers and bare metal) so the end user can focus on deploying,
    managing, and scaling their applications and data. Without going into the [history
    of the PaaS](https://datica.com/blog/saas-paas-iaas-whats-the-difference/) concept,
    it's easy to think about it as a way of automating many of the repetitive, lower-level
    tasks of managing workloads on a server.\n\n## How a PaaS works\n\nThe most well
    known PaaS providers are [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
    and [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). These systems work when
    developers make minimal configuration changes to their application's code and
    then simply \"push\" their code to the cloud. The PaaS will then make an attempt
    to understand the code, install the required dependencies, containerize the application,
    and then serve it up. These providers then have a UI layer for managing resources,
    networking, access, and more.\n\n## The benefits of a PaaS\n\nBeing able to directly
    push your code to the cloud and have it running is a tremendous benefit over the
    old days of standing up a server, installing an operating system (and then patching
    it each time there's a vulnerability), getting nginx configured properly, and
    much more. With a PaaS, developers can focus on delivering value via their product,
    not building IT infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being able to simply push your
    code and have it running, many of these PaaS providers also couple database managed
    services as part of their Platform.\n\n## The pitfalls of a PaaS\n\nThe ease of
    use for a PaaS comes at the cost of flexibility. Want to install custom software
    on an instance? Nope. Want to ssh into an instance to investigate an issue that
    isn't appearing in the logs? Nope. Want to do anything beyond a simple Ruby, Python,
    or Node app? Good luck.\n\nA PaaS serves a very specific purpose — to help small
    teams with simple applications run those in the cloud without the DevOps overhead
    of managing a fleet of instances on AWS or Azure.\n\nThe primary reason why so
    many PaaS providers have failed to make substantial headway in the enterprise
    space is because the model is so restrictive. For an organization managing hundreds
    of applications with petabytes of data, it makes more sense to build out a team
    that can manage all of it instead of making substantial changes to your business
    in order to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\n## Enter Kubernetes and containers\n\nNow
    that the world has sufficiently been eaten by software, applications and tools
    have become ever larger and more complex. A small organization that just three
    years ago could have survived on Heroku is now growing at a pace that prohibits
    them from continuing to use a restrictive PaaS. Maybe they're exploring machine
    learning or want a data warehouse. Whatever the case, they've outgrown the PaaS
    model. Now they need to move to something more flexible: Kubernetes.\n\nSince
    the invention of containers, and specifically with the popularity of Docker, organizations
    have been figuring out easier ways to orchestrate containers — that is, how to
    get them running, connected and served up in the cloud. In a way, orchestration
    is the primary function of a PaaS. Because containers are relatively trivial to
    build (and in most cases the build process can be automated, ex: [Gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/))
    the focus in the container space has been on orchestration.\n\n## The benefits
    of containers\n\nThe benefits of containers over virtual machines has been discussed
    to no end on the internet. I won't go into detail here, but simply put — with
    containers, developers can port their applications from machine to machine whether
    that's running it locally on a Mac, on a server in AWS or on a droplet on Digital
    Ocean. A container is a container and it can run anywhere. Compare this to the
    complexity of managing an entire fleet  VM, each with its own OS. With containers
    there’s only one operating system to manage, even with hundreds of containers.\n\n##
    Why Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes and containers have many of the same benefits. They
    can both run anywhere and they both function the same whether they're running
    on AWS, Azure, GCP, or in the locked closet down the hall. Kubernetes is open
    source, financially backed by hundreds of organizations, and is managed by the
    [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/). In addition to being
    cross-cloud compatible and open source, Kubernetes has also shown tremendous growth
    in the last year.\n\nIf you’re coming from a PaaS you’ll no doubt have concerns
    around the ease of use and lack of automated DevOps support in Kubernetes. When
    I first explored Kubernetes in late 2014 I walked away feeling like it was too
    complicated and didn’t fit Datica’s customer use case. In 2018 it’s a different
    story.\n\nSince Kubernetes officially hit 1.0 in 2015, the community and project
    have grown at a tremendous pace. What really makes Kubernetes a viable option
    is not the core project itself, but the community of tools and add-ons that surround
    it. Kubernetes isn’t a PaaS, it’s a foundation on which to build a PaaS.\n\nThink
    of Kubernetes and the cloud native community as a set of building blocks. With
    these building blocks you can construct any number of different solutions. No
    longer are you held back or restricted by PaaS providers. \n\n## Which to choose\n\nThe
    decision to choose Kubernetes over a PaaS (or vice versa) is going to depend on
    your business, technology, market, team, and several other factors. Having said
    that, even if you currently have a simple application with a relatively smaller
    user base, you’re likely going to scale and change rapidly. Preparing for the
    future by moving to containers now is going to save you time and money when it
    becomes critical later on.\n"

    a bit of the who, what, why, when, and how behind quality care.
  :post: |-
    ## The Joint Commission (TJC)

    Being the most well-known, hospitals and health systems all maintain TJC accreditation regarding their clinical care processes, ability and performance on specific quality measures and standards of care. TJC has been involved in performance measurement since the mid-1980s and launched its ORYX initiative in the late 1990s as the first national program for measurement of hospital quality. TJC has established standardized core performance measure sets for hospital operations and contributes to the national strategy for improving healthcare quality transparency. The Joint Commission can also be found at the forefront of new programs such as MACRA/MIPS.

    ## Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

    CMS mandates the reporting of quality measures by hospitals, physicians, and providers of other healthcare products and services. CMS's Measures Management System provides a standardized process for ensuring that CMS will have a rational, conspicuous system to measure the quality of care delivered to recipients. This system was developed in coordination with the other organizations mentioned in this post. CMS collaborates with private, nonprofit organizations such as The Joint Commission and the American Medical Association to create quality measures necessary for regulatory compliance, including the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program, the Physician Quality Reporting System, and Hospital Compare.

    ## National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)

    The NCQA is one of the main certification and accreditation organizations for patient-centric medical home initiatives, health plan accreditations, disease and case management, and other healthcare provider certification and recognition programs. The NCQA provides and governs the development of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) ambulatory care measures.

    ## National Quality Forum (NQF)

    The NQF has a focus on building consensus on national healthcare goals and priorities for quality measurement and performance improvement, being the industry's leading endorsement organization for the development and approval of quality measures. As new quality measures are developed and tested, the NQF plays a vital role in validating measures prior to official use and implementation.

    ## American Medical Association (AMA)

    The AMA, a national association for physicians, convened the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in 2000. Since then, the PCPI has grown to include participants from various organizations and has identified copious measures spanning multiple measure sets. The PCPI is continually working to develop measures on patient-centric care.

    ## Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)

    AHRQ is an entity within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides a clearinghouse for quality measures, coordination of evidence-based best practics, and annual reportings of national clinical quality measures. AHRQ also manages the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) patient satisfaction surveys.

    ## Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC)

    The URAC is a healthcare quality accreditation organization for health plans, provider organizations, and physician practices with various accreditation and certification programs. These programs include healthcare utilization reviews, patient-centered healthcare homes (PCHCH), pharmacy benefits management, healthcare website maintenance, claims management, and disease management to list a few. These accreditations serve an important purpose for insurance commissioners, state and federal legislators, employers, and consumers because they are a sign of a high quality and represent the organization's ability to meet agreeable performance metrics levels.

    Since these quality measure reportings are mandated by government regulations, the ability to harmonize these measures has become an important discussion topic. These mandated reportings may ultimately contradict internal quality improvement efforts focused on different measures. These different metrics may have overlapping population segments, track performance for supporting or competing quality measurement organizations, or require seemingly identical measures of conditions or diseases but utilize different data, exclusions, numerators, or denominators.  Having an understanding of these organizations is critical in healthcare, so if you have questions, reach out to us [directly][1], [tweet us][2], or provide us your contact information to the right. We'll solve your problem so you can focus on your solution.

    such as, EHR integrations and cloud hosting.
  :blog_lead: Healthcare providers are facing increasingly severe economic and social
    pressures that ultimately affect their service budgets and the ability to deliver
    on quality services. As with all businesses, providers must also overcome the
    tremendous pressures of industry competition. In an age where thriving is equivalent
    to surviving, an attractive approach for the healthcare industry is outsourcing.
    While manifesting a vast array of diverse and complex services, hospitals are
    a distinctly lush domain for outsourcing many functions, for example, [EHR Integrations](https://datica.com/discover/ehr-integrations/)
    and [cloud hosting](https://datica.com/discover/healthcare-cloud/).

    ## Building Internally

    There really are many advantages to providing services by utilizing an internal staff. The weighty benefit is price, assuming that service qualities are comparable. An additional two motives for keeping services in-house are reliable continuity and vested interests. An internal staff has a heightened understanding of the patient requirements and procedures necessary in a multitude of situations. Additionally is the anticipation of continuity. Staff will need to face actionable consequences, leading to increased strategic alignment through fortified internal and client relationships.

    ## Outsourcing as a Strategy

    Expectations of the healthcare consumer are growing, and so are the costs and the competition. Although there are advantages of keeping services in-house, outsourcing offers several unique values. Healthcare is an ever-changing environment where profits plummet, capacity crashes, and service levels slump. In this framework, the advantages of outsourcing non-medical services is a viable strategy to be considered.

    With increasing service volumes, costs per service unit will lessen, meaning outsourcing services can preserve resources through scaling economies. Independent hospitals may be unable to meet the expense levels achieved by external providers when combining their service volumes to various service units. However, outsourcing can only reduce cost when three requisites are me:

    1. There are economies of scale
    2. The economies transcend corporate boundaries
    3. The savings are sufficient to generate profit even after paying off all stakeholders

    The modern need to outsource is rooted in the generational desire to be proactive. Hospitals are incessantly on the brink of slighting margins, [increasing patient expectations](https://datica.com/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-1-the-rise-of-patient-as-consumer/) and minimal federal support. However, hospitals now understand the costs of reactive, short-term, tactical solutions to immediate issues. The key to survival lies in leveraging organizational attributes while enacting continuous incremental improvements in effectiveness and efficiency – more often than not by using third-party vendors.

    ## Outsourcing Benchmark Measures

    With that said, healthcare entities need some benchmark metrics to assess the true value of an increased commitment to outsourcing its services at both holistic and strategic levels.

    * **Employee Gratification**: Does internal staff experience increased satisfaction due to outsourced functions and being capable to invest more of time in strategic and innovative initiatives?
    * **Consumer Satisfaction**: Is the outside provider delivering equal or increased service to consumers in contrast to in-house services? Is staff more attentive to core functions due to outsourcing?
    * **Economic Value Contribution**: Does the external vendor deliver more efficiently to achieve cost savings? Is the entity able to evade additional costs by outsourcing?
    * **Competitive Advantages**: Is there a competitive edge with outsourcing? Are prospective and existing clients increasing service engagements because of outsourced services?
    * **Allocation of Resources**: Is the service provider reliably delivering the required quality and scope through dedicated resources: labor, technology, knowledge, and assets? Is the current allocation of resources appropriate for the agreed upon objective? Is the resource division mutually satisfactory?

    In sum, the advantages of outsourcing are that hospitals can assume access to asset improvement funds, widespread risk sharing of [HIPAA Compliance](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/), increased cost avoidance and savings, considerable resource access, enhanced employee retention, and raised patient satisfaction. Long-term strategic, transformative partnerships with vendors may introduce market opportunities beyond either party's core competence. A few long-term, strategic service vendors may be a more fruitful arrangement in comparison to a multitude of narrow-focused, short-term, one-off relationships.
