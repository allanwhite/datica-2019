  :guide_text: "What does \"HIPAA Compliant\" really mean? Frequently it is just a
    marketing label that some companies bestow upon themselves and not really an attestation
    of compliance. That's risky.\n\nThis worksheet is meant to illuminate the cloud
    requirements of HIPAA that you need to plan for in your own digital health product.
    A more comprehensive risk assessment, such as the HITRUST CSF Self-Assessment,
    is also necessary. Use this checklist to understand what compliance controls are
    needed, and assess your compliant state at several cloud layers:\n\n- __The Physical
    Layer__ \n- __The Operating System and Application Layers__ \n- __The Administrative
    Layer__\n\nOnce you've completed this checklist you'll have a much better understanding
    of what it will take to be HIPAA compliant in the cloud."

    that knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education, personnel,
    and money. This guide will help makers of digital health products make informed
    decisions about whether to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in
    the form of the Datica Compliant Kubernetes Service.\n\nThis TCO guide explains
    the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and offers
    a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates for each
    of those considerations. These estimates are based on our extensive experience
    working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers
    (like AWS and Azure).\n\nWhat's inside:\n\n- Understanding compliance in the cloud
    \n- Flying solo on AWS or Azure is primitive\n- The importance of proving compliance
    with HITRUST \n- The total cost of ownership framework and estimates\n- TCO summary"

    Computing Total Cost of Ownership is an important project for any technology leader, but healthcare integrations pose a particularly challenging problem due to hidden process costs.

    When calculating the decision between building your own integrations versus working with a managed service provider, the 'right' answer is the best fitting solution dependent on organizational needs.

    The Datica guide to healthcare integration total cost of ownership will help give you the knowledge to determine your own TCO calculation. Included in the guide:

    - The integration process
    - People - roles and responsibilities
    - Components of work efforts and effort estimates
    - Summary

  :guide_text: "In a recent blog post on the [Rise and the Fall of the EHR](/blog/2017-healthcare-trends-part-three-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-ehr/),
    Datica co-founder Travis Good, MD mentioned how EHR vendors are promoting FHIR
    as a way to allow open access to EHR data. In this guide, we’ll review what FHIR
    enables in health systems, not from a technology perspective, but from an operational
    improvement perspective.\n\nAt Datica, we often focus on the problem that we solve
    to stay true to our focus and identity when making strategic decisions. Many of
    our employees have decades of experience in enterprise EHR implementations and
    they often say that in their EHR implementation days no one asked them, “What
    problem do you solve?” If you were to ask an EHR vendor this question a number
    of years ago, they might say they digitize paper health records to improve accessibility
    of information. EHRs have met their goal and the patients’ healthcare data is
    centrally stored and can be viewed across disciplines in an organization.\n\nToday,
    we realize that those EHR implementations were laying the information technology
    groundwork that would become the fabric of a healthcare transformation movement.
    As Good wrote in his post, the EHR and data consolidation are just the first steps
    in organizational\ntransformation. \n\nThe Datica guide to __FHIR for Health Systems__
    will help explain the best way to adopt open data models to fuel transformation.
    Included in the guide:\n\n- Healthcare’s Focus is on Transformation\n- Open Data
    Models – A Path Forward for Modern Integration\n- Respond with Agility\n- Be Flexible
    in Vendor Choice\n- Foster a Culture of Innovation\n- Give up Some of Your Legos"
