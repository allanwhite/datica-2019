  :summary: In this guide we explain our methodology for computing healthcare integration
    total cost of ownership. We make the case that modern, cloud-based technology
    has fundamentally changed the TCO formula. Follow along as we walk you through
    our personal computations.

    Computing Total Cost of Ownership is an important project for any technology leader, but healthcare integrations pose a particularly challenging problem due to hidden process costs.

    When calculating the decision between building your own integrations versus working with a managed service provider, the 'right' answer is the best fitting solution dependent on organizational needs.

    The Datica guide to healthcare integration total cost of ownership will help give you the knowledge to determine your own TCO calculation. Included in the guide:

    - The integration process
    - People - roles and responsibilities
    - Components of work efforts and effort estimates
    - Summary

    Cloud Compliance. Sign up to get chapter 2 now and be notified when the book is

  :subhead: The Definitive Book on Cloud Compliance
  :lead: 'Complete Cloud Compliance is a program developed after years of managing
    high-stakes compliance requirements across mission critical healthcare workloads.
    It is a chance to control destiny. The program is written for healthcare organizations,
    but all while under the principle that best practices are best practices, meaning
    the insights shared can be applied across global regimes and any industry.

    ## 9 big ideas in the book

    1. When controlled, compliance is actually a competitive edge.
    2. The cloud is no longer other people's computers. It is managed services.
    3. As cloud services get more abstract to improve developer experience (a good thing), more control is being taken away from the user making compliance attestation harder (a bad thing).
    4. Compliance is only as strong as the weakest link in the abstraction chain.
    5. Frameworks are the best way to manage regulations. The best frameworks are built for a dynamic future, not a dated past.
    6. Complete cloud compliance is hard because technologists struggle to understand compliance while compliance officers struggle to understand the cloud.
    7. The cloud is global, so compliance is now global.
    8. Cloud compliance comes down to data management. The three verbs of data are store, compute, and transmit.
    9. Data sources are splintering instead of unifying, making compliance more complex.

    Nothing has fully tied together the compliance considerations needed for the cloud-native, microservices-based architectures of this modern era until now. Complete Cloud Compliance(3C) is the new mandate for cloud-based healthcare applications.

    In this practical webinar, extracted from Chapters 5 and 6 of the upcoming book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://datica.com/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/), we’ll show you how compliance has failed to keep up with modern cloud architectures and will detail the steps you need to take to ensure cloud compliance.

    ## Watch this webinar to:

    * Understand the compliance tradeoffs caused by today’s abstraction of the cloud, including cloud-native microservices and managed services.
    * Find out the 6 common components that are necessary for any 3C program.
    * Learn how to create a cloud compliance roadmap that will guide your way to your own 3C program.
