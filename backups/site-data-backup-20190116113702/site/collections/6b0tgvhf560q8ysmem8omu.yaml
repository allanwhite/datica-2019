  :lead: "Like it or not, healthcare’s transition from a volume-based incentive model
    to one of value is here. The current industry design is unsustainable given trends
    towards increasing risk exposure and care provider liability. In response, new
    value-based models have been enacted, including readmission prevention, accountable
    care organizations, and bundled payment initiatives. To remain viable through
    this shift, healthcare organizations need to alter their priority of care from
    the provider to what truly matters — the patient. A reshaping foundation of incentives
    coincides with billions of investment dollars from organizations to implement
    electronic health record (EHR) systems, mainly due to the ramifications of the
    HITECH Act and other legislative mandates. These EHR systems are the hub of clinical
    data and clinical workflows today. \n\nUnfortunately, they are hubs siloed across
    thousands of organizations, meaning that the critical health data is siloed away
    as well, leaving it inactionable. The solution? Integration."

    integration is the partnership between providers, payers, vendors, and other players
    that brings the data or function from one application or program to that of another.
    Because of the sheer quantity and diversity of data, healthcare providers face
    major obstacles in integrating and effectively analyzing healthcare information.
    Traditional health IT systems, such as electronic health records and personal
    health record (PHR) systems, utilize completely different technical and semantic
    standards to depict and house data, and are based on exclusive technical architectures.
    With all considered, it can be extremely difficult to properly and easily integrate
    data from multiple, conflicting systems. \n\nData integration methods vary primarily
    in the level on which they focus. \n\n### EHR Integration at the Application Level\nAt
    the application level, integration involves integrating data from individual applications
    by reimplementing them in one domain-wide application. \n\n### EHR Integration
    at the API Level\nIn integration at the API level, applications expose their APIs
    so that other applications can access their data. \n\n### EHR Integration at the
    Data Level\nFinally, at the data level, integration establishes a common domain
    archetype or global schema so that independently developed applications can exchange
    information. Data-level integration has more development flexibility than the
    others because it largely focuses on common exchange. \n\n## Why does EHR Integration
    Matter?\nEHR integration matters because it is how healthcare moves forward. It
    is the key to creating and improving advanced digital health applications. Integrating
    healthcare data from a variety of providers and payers will explicitly improve
    the current healthcare delivery model and extensive research efforts. Data integration
    allows the unification of healthcare data that exists in various forms (structured
    or unstructured) on different data storage systems such as relational database
    management systems, file servers, and EHR standards, such as [HL7 messages](https://datica.com/academy/hl7-101-a-primer/).
    \n\nTrue interoperability and successful Integrations will have a cornucopia of
    benefits, such as a decrease in clinical errors, enhanced care coordination efforts,
    and increased patient care endeavors. Long term, true integration allows for the
    furthering of public health research opportunities and population surveillance
    to identify real-time issues.\n\n\n## What is HL7?\n\n<div class=\"callout drop

    Seven (HL7) is a not-for-profit organization that created a set of standards to
    ensure information unity and validity when sharing data across health information
    exchanges or between healthcare systems, such as, in messaging applications.\n
    \nThese standards, simply referred to as HL7, define how messages are sent from
    one party to another, setting the language, structure, and data types required
    for seamless integration between systems. \n\nTo foster adoption of common data
    exchange to meet the mandates of federally enacted programs, the HL7 Organization
    offers completely free access to their standards. HL7’s C-CDA is a library of
    templates that help enable data exchange needed for EHR Integrations. Various
    types fall under the C-CDA but they all provide a common format to assist in health
    data exchange. This library contains nine templates, each of which has defined
    sections to harmonize the data across systems. \n\n## What is FHIR?\nFast Healthcare
    Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the emerging interoperability standard evolved
    from HL7 by Grahame Grieve and the HL7 organization. It describes data formats
    and elements (known as resources) and a RESTful API for data exchange.\n\n<div

    Why use FHIR for EHR Integrations?\n\n### FHIR is Open Sourced\nFHIR is open sourced,
    making it open to everyone in the industry to participate. It also takes many
    of the learnings from earlier versions of HL7 and incorporates some of those models
    into it. \n\n### RESTful APIs are Easier\nRESTful APIs and accompanying documentation
    will make it much easier for developers and applications to quickly connect and
    get the data needed. \n\n### FHIR Helps Make EHR Integrations Less Expensive\nFHIR
    solutions are built from a set of modular components called “Resources.” These
    resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical
    and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.
    \n\n### FHIR is Flexible\nFHIR is suitable for use in a wide variety of contexts
    – mobile phone apps, cloud communications, EHR-based data sharing, server communication
    in large institutional healthcare providers, and much more.\n\nThe key to enabling
    healthcare organizational transformation is unlocking EHR data to make it easier
    to integrate with. The industry has been focused on interoperability for the reason
    that being able to access the aggregated data is the only way to move from documentation
    tools to innovative care delivery models. An open data standard, such as FHIR,
    and a single implementation of the standard in a centralized data hub is the most
    efficient way to move the needle on data accessibility and represents the future
    of EHR Integrations."

  :summary: HL7 is a healthcare industry standard for messaging between applications,
    for example from EHR to PMS. Learn HL7 basics, including HL7 v2 and v3.
  :lead: 'Health Level Seven (HL7) is a standard utilized by the healthcare industry
    to enable messaging between applications, EHR to PMS (practice management system)
    for example. It is managed and maintained by [Health Level Seven International
    (HL7)](http://hl7.org) which is a not-for-profit, ANSI-accredited standards developing
    organization. '
  :post: |
    The HL7 standard is often jokingly referred to as the “non-standard standard.” This is not very fair but it does reflect the fact that almost every hospital, clinic, imaging center, lab, and care facility is “special” in terms of how it implements HL7 (really?, why?). The reason is primarily because there is no such thing as a standard business or clinical process for interacting with patients, clinical data, or related personnel.

    The HL7 messaging protocol was designed to facilitate high volumes of pre-defined data to be shared across many applications reliably. The protocol selected to make this happen was a traditional file transfer or a TCP/IP **socket** in both a real-time and batched fashion. HL7 v2 message structure is complex, flat, and delimited. HL7 has obviously evolved over time. The current version of HL7 is v3, however, older versions exist and make up the bulk of the standard used today primarily because of the large number customizations that have been done to each HL7 message.

    #### The key differences between an HL7 v2 and HL7 v3 message are as follows:

    1. v2.x was primarily meant for clinical communications - medical orders, patient registration etc. whereas v3.x has additional features for use by informaticists and for government reporting requirements.
    2. v2.x was a custom format (barebones text - all coded and separated by a pipe with headers and multiple segments etc.) v2.x looks like this:

    ![academy-hl7protocol](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/612KI64BeokOUW82m0w0oc/f4b03fd55891221f038ed0e8ad1c1521/academy-hl7protocol.png)

    whereas an HL7 v3.0 message is an XML format (I'm not sure if that's an improvement) - very verbose and detailed - like this:

    ![academy-hl7syntax](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/Ea7Dy1f3CCGWM4uWEwsWK/7ac35d657e029cf8c71aa8dfaa33bef1/academy-hl7syntax.png)

    3. All v2.x formats are backward compatible. v3.x is a wholly separate format and not backwards compatible.

    Any technology solution in healthcare has to support both v2.x and v3.x formats. Open source parsing solutions exist to help with processing HL7 (see section below on Parsing HL7 messages). However, in this author's humble opinion, the 3.x standards are unlikely to be implemented given the investments already made in the 2.x versions. The [FHIR](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/) standards, which are still under active development, are more likely to be implemented rather than the v3.0 standards. See this Figure for some data supporting this hypothesis. (source: Corepoint)

    ![academy-figure1](//images.contentful.com/189dvqdsjh46/2CnbugFEHqQ0SWymeeEWGK/33f4cac50b16d3845ddaf11f32d0a36c/academy-figure1.png)

    ### Customization

    Every conversation that you've ever overheard about HL7 usually includes customizations to be accounted for and associated implementation costs. When I was starting in this space, I heard the same things but wasn't really sure what it meant.

    So here's a summary of what I've learned. I will caveat this by saying that I am not an HL7 expert - there are folks out there who have much more extensive experience than I do; [Keith Boone](http://motorcycleguy.blogspot.com/) for one, whose blog is worth subscribing to if you have any interest in healthcare standards for one. Given that I'm not an expert, if you see any errors in this document, please let me know (and also let us know if you're looking for an interesting change in [careers](mailto:jobs@catalyze.io)).

    More about custom formats... HL7 messages are indeed customized but this does not imply, as an example, that every ADT (admission, discharge, transfer) message is different between different hospitals; ADT is ubiquitous so it's an HL7 message type you should know. Customization came about when certain message types, like ADT, could not support sending all the data elements that needed to be sent. For example, a message might be able to handle only 50 data elements but an EKG reading might need to send over 200. The extra data elements were then sent over using the notorious Z segment - a miscellaneous segment into which pretty much any key value pair could be jammed in. This custom blob of data in the Z segment would then need to be parsed and mapped etc. for automated processing and use, creating impressive levels of customization in data exchange.

    Before you get too excited, the true customization comes in the form of the content of the HL7 message. The HL7 organization has defined code sets to be used to translate the terse codes sent over within the HL7 message. See [here](https://www.impactportal.info/emrCodeSet.asp?SID=4) for a listing of some v2.3 code sets or [here](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) for a more comprehensive listing from the "horse's mouth." The purpose of the code sets, as you can imagine, is to codify the content to reduce the size of the message. ANT, as an example, stands for Anterior in the context of body sites and so on. And, by the way, these code sets for HL7 have also evolved / been added to / modified with each version of HL7. However, these code sets, which are released and maintained as part of the standard, aren't often adhered to. EHRs (usually) and hospitals have defined their own code sets. So the content sent over within the HL7 message needs to be "looked up" against that specific code set before it can be made useful. An Epic code set is unique (although common across Epic deployments) and different from an AllScripts code set. This is the uniqueness that must be addressed by any solution in this space and the reason why HL7 implementations can sometimes be expensive - they need to take into account not only the Z segments and map them to the appropriate data models but the code sets have to be taken into account as well.

    So, in practice, HL7 can be perhaps best described as a messaging protocol and format standard in most implementations rather than as a comprehensive messaging standard.

    ### HL7 Message Types (most common)

    There are more than 80 message types, a whole host of segments and codes for pretty much anything you can think of. See [this](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/vocab/v26_appendix_a.pdf) document for a pretty comprehensive listing. But the following are the most common HL7 message types:

    |Message Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |ACK|General acknowledgement message. This is the ack sent when a message is received by the destination system. ACKs are automated responses. However, you could use ACKs as a way to modulate the speed at which messages come through as the sending system will not send the next message until the ACK is received|
    |ADT|Admission, Discharge and Transfer message. Created whenever a patient goes through any of those states. There are a whole list of these possible states. See below for a sampling of a few more|
    |ORM|Pharmacy/treatment order message|
    |ORU|Observation message (unsolicited). Unsolicited because the destination systems are not asking for it, it is fired off and the source systems will take it in and process it if needed or discard it if not.|
    |BAR|Add or change the billing account.|
    |SIU|Schedule information (unsolicited) usually patient specific. This is used to create, modify and delete patient appointments and other schedules.|
    |MDM|Medical document management. This often acts as a workhorse. It is meant to handle documents like notes, reports etc. But often is used to capture a whole host of other data for which there is no easy mapping. In which case, the incoming data gets converted into a PDF and pushed into the EHR via this MDM message|
    |DFT|Detailed financial transactions. This data is used to capture the details of procedures etc. so that claims can be generated.|
    |MFN|Master files notification - changes to core data elements are sent through this.|
    |QRY|Query - as the name implies is used to query source systems for data on things like patient demographics etc.|
    |RAS|Pharmacy/treatment administration message|
    |RDE|Pharmacy/treatment encoded order message|
    |RGV|Pharmacy/treatment give message|

    ​It should also be noted that each of these message types have different types (sub-types) as well. For example, there are 51 (yep, that's right) different types of ADT messages that are used for various trigger events. Some of the most commonly used ADT messages include:

    - ADT-A01 – patient admit

    - ADT-A02 – patient transfer

    - ADT-A03 – patient discharge

    - ADT-A04 – patient registration

    - ADT-A05 – patient pre-admission

    - ADT-A08 – patient information update

    - ADT-A11 – cancel patient admit

    - ADT-A12 – cancel patient transfer

    - ADT-A13 – cancel patient discharge

    The important thing to remember is that the content of the message doesn't change all that much between all these sub-types. The message is still about the specific patient (PID segment - see segment section below).

    ### HL7 Segments

    A segment is a group of fields that then contain different types of data. Each segment exists independently and can be utilized in multiple messages, in different sequences. Segments may be required for a particular message or in other cases, they may be optional.

    A unique three-character code called the "Segment ID" identifies each segment. Segment ID codes beginning with the letter Z are reserved for the "custom" Z-segments (key value pairs) that are not part of the HL7 standard.

    You can remove one or more segments from a message if desired. But because HL7 rules state that unexpected or unused segments should be ignored, most systems will ignore the unexpected segments without issue (therefore, manually removing these segments is unnecessary). Segments should be removed only if one of the receiving systems will not have problems when unexpected segments are received.

    These are the most common segment types that will be used across multiple message types.

    |Segment Name|Description|
    |------------|-----------|
    |DG1|Diagnosis|
    |EVN|Event type|
    |GT1|Guarantor|
    |IN1|>Insurance|
    |MSH|Message header|
    |NTE|Notes and comments|
    |OBRI|Observation Request|
    |OBXI|Observation Result|
    |ORCI|Common Order|
    |PID|Patient Identification|

  :summary: Considering EHRs eat up clinician time, clinicians are a mobile workforce,
    and nearly 100% have smartphones, lets reimagine clinical documentation to be
    mobile-first.
  :blog_lead: As my daughter shoved my iPhone into my face this morning to try to
    unlock it, seems fitting to be writing about mobile today. When I think of mobile,
    I now think only of smartphones and not tablets. I used to consider tablets but
    increasingly they feel closer to the desktop experience as I can’t really use
    them on the go the same way I can use my phone. A mobile strategy should be synonymous
    with a smartphone strategy.
  :post: "As an aside, before I started this post I was going over my personal task
    list. I was attempting to add symbols for the various ways in which I can complete
    tasks (phone, email, etc). This goes back to my days of following [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/).
    Anyway, what I quickly discovered as I sat at the airport was that none of the
    tasks I needed to complete could really be done on my smartphone. Well, I could
    probably complete several of them but it would be incredibly inefficient compared
    to doing them on my computer. It quickly occurred to me that anything I could
    do on mobile was already done, and the only tasks left were on hold until I got
    time on my computer. Most of the on-hold tasks were longer content pieces.\n\nThe
    title of this post refers to a post by [Fred Wilson from 8 years ago](https://avc.com/2010/09/mobile-first-web-second/)
    about building products first for mobile, then for larger form factors. There
    are lots of success stories of products that launched and only supported mobile
    (Waze and Instagram to name a couple). For consumer health products, the paradigm
    of mobile-first development holds true today. Look no further than then the myriad
    of health and wellness apps in the [iOS App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/).
    To gain adoption and engaged users, mobile is essential. This post isn’t about
    mobile consumer healthcare apps.\n\nOn the enterprise side of healthcare, the
    dominant software in use today is the EHR. It’s used by all different types of
    users across clinical, financial, and even operations. Specifically for clinical
    users, EHRs eat up significant amounts of time each day. By and large, the major
    EHR vendors (Epic, Cerner, and Athena) are not mobile-first. This means that clinical
    users are forced to find and spend much of their time each day on a desktop screen.
    For a very mobile workforce, this is an incredibly inefficient use of time.\n\nThere
    are examples of newer, iPad-first or iPad-only EHRs. My wife and several of her
    colleagues use a specialty-specific [iPad-only EHR from Modernizing Medicine](https://www.modmed.com).
    A scribe charts her encounters and then my wife is left, usually at the end of
    the week, with 100-150 notes to close out. She does this at home on her iPad but
    could just as easily close them out on a computer. The reason her EHR is mobile-first,
    for her at least, is because she has a scribe that charts her encounter while
    she sees the patient. The caveat to this is she still uses a laptop at home in
    the evenings to quickly close out notes and do referrals.\n\n## Unbundling the
    EHR\n\nConsidering [EHRs are inefficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24060331)
    when it comes to eating up clinician time (a very valuable resource), clinicians
    are a mobile workforce, and [nearly 100% of clinicians have smartphones](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416951/smartphone-use-for-professional-purposes-among-us-physicians/),
    it’s worth thinking about how to reimagine clinical documentation to be mobile-first.
    This isn’t to say EHRs don’t help with organizational efficiency but I’m thinking
    about clinician efficiency. The major EHR vendors listed above are not going to
    be replaced anytime soon and, if I was an investor, I wouldn’t invest in a new
    enterprise EHR. That leaves the option of chipping away at specific sets of functionality
    currently in the EHR. I have come to refer to this as [unbundling the EHR](https://datica.com/blog/2018-trends-6-predictions-post-ehr-world/).\n\nEHRs
    in a mobile-first world are only possible by unpacking the functionality of the
    EHR into discrete workflows/functions that can be completed efficiently on a smartphone.
    This isn’t replacing the EHR but is a way to make using an EHR more efficient.
    It’s mobile-enabling the EHR, or more accurately clinical workflow, in a stepwise
    fashion with a goal to leverage mobile to minimize desktop time and use. The data
    remains within the EHR (at least for the immediate term) but the ways in which
    clinicians interface with EHR data are broken up into discrete, mobile-enabled
    functions. Proving ROI with this approach is not hard if solutions either improve
    throughput/capacity for clinicians or show benefits like closing out notes in
    a more timely way and being able to bill faster or more accurately. And marketing
    these solutions as helping healthcare organizations better leverage the massive
    investment they have made in EHRs will resonate. Essentially, the goal is to leverage
    mobile to more efficiently use an EHR and only leave certain functions to non-mobile
    devices.\n\nIn order to succeed the specific functionality enabled on mobile needs
    to be able to pull the relevant context, usually based on the patient. By definition,
    these types of solutions are dependent on EHR data and must be able to integrate
    with the EHR. This is becoming easier as EHRs [open up data via FHIR](https://datica.com/academy/introduction-to-fhir/)
    but data integration remains the biggest hurdle to unpacking the EHR and starting
    to break up the EHR user experience. This is another example of EHR customers
    needing to push their EHR vendors harder to accelerate initiatives to ease access
    to EHR data.\n\n## Mobile-first EHR Tools \n\nThere are already successful examples
    of unbundling the EHR to leverage mobile. Many of these, even ones that have scaled
    to hundreds of hospitals, are still only scratching the surface of unbundling
    the EHR.\n\n- __Clinical Communications__. Communication is a major part of delivering
    care to patients. It also happens to be something that EHRs don’t do very well.
    Companies like [Voalte](https://www.voalte.com/) and [TigerConnect](https://www.tigerconnect.com/)
    have built products to connect clinicians. And now these companies are expanding
    the value to users with new workflows and data integration. I’ve never seen this
    statistic but I wonder how much time nurses and doctors spend in clinical communication
    apps vs EHRs.\n\n- __Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI)__. This is a new
    mobile-enabled functionality to be unbundled from the EHR. [Artifact Health](https://www.artifacthealth.com/)
    is a good example. Artifact built a mobile application that brings relevant patient
    context related to CDI into a mobile interface where clinicians can answer simple
    questions. The answers to those questions are then returned back to the EHR and/or
    billing. Instead of having a stack of CDI requests linger in an inbox in the EHR
    or a physical desk, clinicians can now complete CDI requests quickly and easily
    on the go.\n\n- __Real-time Device Data__. This is an area where [Airstrip](https://www.airstrip.com/)
    still dominates. Airstrip started with maternal heart rate monitors and have since
    extended to other medical devices as well as EHR data. The goal for Airstrip is
    to be the mobile interface for clinical workflow and mobile-relevant clinical
    data. They offer desktop tools but the real success of Airstrip is in focusing
    on the mobile experience of clinicians. \n\n- __Data Entry__. Data entry into
    EHRs is a massive time suck for clinicians. There are a few different approaches
    to unbundle this functionality from the EHR. The most widely used today is scribing,
    with companies like [Augmedix](https://www.augmedix.com/) and [iScribes](https://iscribes.co/)
    as examples of technology-enabled virtual scribing. Scribing is essentially a
    Mechanical Turk operation with audio, and sometimes video, recordings of patient
    encounters documented in the EHR by people other than the providers conducting
    the encounters. Newer voice-based tools intelligently automate the creation of
    cards of documentation based on physician speech recording during encounters.\n\n-
    __Virtual Visits__. Despite what the EHR vendors may say, telemedicine is not
    exactly a core EHR function. Increasingly, virtual care is being delivered by
    clinical staff via mobile apps and services like [Spruce Health](https://sprucehealth.com)
    and [Zipnosis](https://zipnosis.com).\n\nThese are just a few examples. There
    are lots more opportunities to unbundle specific functionality of the EHR. While
    not replacing the EHR or even obviously threatening its dominant place in clinical
    and health IT, the approach of unbundling the EHR chips away at one of the two
    primary pillars of the EHR moat — the EHR as the primary clinical user interface
    and the EHR as the primary clinical data repository.\n\nBy leveraging mobile,
    new mobile-first EHR tools have the potential to engage very valuable users —
    clinicians. Once engaged, there are opportunities to extend functionality with
    interconnected apps and data (iOS shortcuts would be very interesting ways to
    link clinical apps into workflows). And, the hardest part of the process, [integration
    with EHR data](https://datica.com/compliant-managed-integration/), is only done
    once at each site so an extension to new offerings is considerably easier after
    the first one.\n\nUnbundling the EHR is where we are going to see the most successful
    disruption of the EHR in enterprise health IT. It’s a matter of timing and the
    market is now ripe as we shift towards a post-EHR world.\n\n"
