Whether at AWS re:Invent last Fall or just on the Internet searching for answers and solutions on the cloud, the amount of noise in the market is incredibly high right now. Filtering that noise down to meaningful signal is nearly impossible, a challenge made harder as many cloud buyers are still fuzzy about their enterprise cloud strategies.</div></pre><br/><pre><div markdown="0">
> One thing I can't stand is the noise, noise, noise, noise! - Grinch

The reasons for the issue of noise is multifaceted. On the one hand, the cloud service providers (CSPs) — AWS, Microsoft, and Google — are redefining the cloud every month with new managed services. AWS crossed one thousand managed services in 2018. And the cloud providers are pushing the market to adopt these managed services, driving the conversation. In many respects, the power of the cloud lies in the ability to offload the running (setup and maintenance) of software by enterprises to dedicated CSPs. CSPs run software for customers as managed services.

On the other hand, there’s a gold rush to develop offerings on top of CSPs. Everybody from Capital One to Deloitte to countless startups were at [AWS re:Invent](https://datica.com/blog/aws-re-invent-re-actions-controlling-risk-is-important-but-confusing/) in December with products and services on top of your cloud accounts. You can buy everything from a team to set up and manage your entire cloud account to a single pane of glass into the cost of your cloud workloads to a widget to automate simple, repetitive tasks on the cloud. It’s overwhelming.

The [job-to-be-done (JTBD)](https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/12/the-jobs-to-be-done-theory-of-innovation) for cloud buyers is dependent on the maturity of the organization in developing and executing a cloud strategy. Ultimately, the JTBD of the organization to which the individual cloud buyer works is to get onto the cloud. In getting an organization onto the cloud, they realize the benefits of offloading the management of infrastructure, convert the bulk of IT spend from capital expenditures (Capex) to operating expenditures (Opex), and, ideally, improve or at least maintain consistent [security and privacy posture](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance/). The last point is increasingly important as organizations need to avoid exposing themselves to the increased risk associated with data breach or loss by moving to the cloud.

The CSP is the platform. It’s a platform with literally thousands upon thousands of configuration and architecture choices in the form of mixing and matching various managed services. Couple that with the myriad of third-party products and services in and around the CSPs and the options grow even more.

Sadly, for the cloud buyer and the enterprise that just wants to get onto the cloud, 2019 will only see more optionality, point solutions, and ultimately noise.  While the end state of the cloud as a large part of the IT infrastructure for every organization in the world is firmly established, the path to get to that end state is going to be full of fits and starts as entities try to filter the noise of the cloud into something that delivers value.

At this stage and in this light, the CSPs are ultimately the only clear winners, and they are going to be very, very big winners when the cloud eventually tips. The distribution of winnings is still TBD, but [AWS has continued to be the dominant player](https://siliconangle.com/2018/11/19/no-surprise-amazon-continues-dominate-public-cloud-market/).

That leaves a few thousand other cloud solutions providers competing to solve specific challenges on the cloud, trying to differentiate themselves in an extremely crowded market. The market is large, and the winners are still being determined so we will continue to see massive investments both in new ventures as well as in spinouts of large enterprises.

The cloud is now being operationalized for enterprises. By that I mean, enterprises are now putting operational cloud roadmaps into effect instead of just strategic initiatives related to the cloud. Both net new and legacy applications are on that cloud roadmap, though larger enterprises will take years to fully implement the roadmap. We will be living in a hybrid world for the next five to ten years but ultimately enterprise IT will be run on the cloud, with the bulk of that being public cloud.</div></pre><br/><pre><div markdown="0">> Your margin is my opportunity. - Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO

As the [march to the cloud continues](https://datica.com/blog/2019-predictions-cloud-noise-noise-noise/), the constraint on timing is not technical. That foundation of the cloud is largely built already and the winners are clear, 1) Amazon (AWS), 2) Microsoft (Azure), and 3) Google (GCP), though the distribution of cloud revenue is still a fierce battle between those 3 behemoths. With the foundation built, we enter the post-cloud world.

## CSPs will go from IT infrastructure to IT everything

What does that world look like? It is a paradigm shift in the outsourcing of enterprise IT to a third party. The cloud foundation built by the major cloud service providers (CSPs) Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, will be the literal glue that runs enterprise IT of the future. This is both exciting and scary. It’s exciting because enterprises will have more resources and attention to focus on their core business, be that retail, healthcare, finance, education, or any other type. It’s scary because it’s an immense amount of power and leverage that enterprises are giving up to CSPs.

In 2019, we will start to appreciate how the CSPs will leverage their foundational role in enterprise IT to reach their tentacles vertically up the stack of IT. Similarly to how Microsoft in the 1990s leveraged Windows as the foundation to scale vertical applications within enterprises, CSPs will be doing the same thing in the 2020s. Just how far up the technology stack CSPs go is an open question. And just how much CSPs can leverage their power is going to be an [Antitrust Law question](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellewitt/2018/05/01/how-long-can-amazons-ingenious-antitrust-avoidance-last/#5c8b2e070ac0).

An illustrative example is an AWS acquisition from January 2019. AWS acquired a disaster recovery and cloud migration company called [CloudEndure for $200M](https://www.consultingindustry24.com/amazon-acquires-disaster-recovery-service-provider-cloudendure-for-reported-200-milllions/) CloudEndure is a SaaS product and a part of the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace). Disaster recovery and migration are value-added services on top of the cloud but they are SaaS products, not infrastructure (IaaS) or platform (PaaS).

The expansion into SaaS is not necessarily new to AWS but I think it is interesting to think about how far the CSPs will go in offering software solutions on top of their clouds. AWS already has a conference/video calling solution, why not a productivity suite like Office or GSuite or a CRM like Salesforce? If we take an analogy from Amazon the retail giant, it is that Amazon can easily go from the IT infrastructure store (the cloud) to the IT everything store.

Microsoft and Google will similarly follow suit. Both already have applications that are popular in enterprises. Microsoft has aligned its cloud products around Office (productivity), Dynamics (CRM), and Azure (cloud). It is only a matter of time before AWS does the same thing. Google, playing catchup to both AWS and Microsoft, will be interesting to watch as it still needs to rapidly gain adoption for its foundation.

And, increasingly, enterprises will see the benefits of the reduced friction of working with one of the major CSPs while running across multiple CSPs. As CSPs aggregate more and more of the customers, their leverage will grow. It is a virtuous cycle that we are just starting to see in 2019.

Now, it’s an arms race by hyperscale providers, predominantly Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, to launch abstracted, proprietary, managed cloud services to meet the specific needs and use cases of developers and enterprises deploying net new applications and migrating existing, on-premise applications to the cloud. </div></pre><br/><pre><div markdown="0">2019 will be the year cloud customers start to abandon the notion of multi-cloud and anchor on a hybrid-cloud future involving a mix of on-premise services, often enabled or augmented by services from their preferred cloud provider, and managed cloud services.

Over the last five years, we have witnessed the incredible growth of managed services from hyperscale providers. Amazon alone offers more than one thousand different managed services. Software-delivered managed services abstract cloud customers from the underlying hardware, operating systems, and often networking. The ease of use and scale of these managed services comes at a cost as managed services create lock-in with cloud providers — lock-in that makes migrating from hyperscale provider to hyperscale provider practically not an option. More and more cloud deployments and enterprise cloud accounts contain multiple managed services with multiple, sometimes hundreds or thousands, instances of each service. Replicating this across hyperscale providers, and learning an entirely new set of proprietary managed services, is not practical or even justifiable to achieve the goal of avoiding lock-in.

As the cloud moves from a tool for developers to a key part of an organization's strategy, larger and larger enterprises are starting their journey to the cloud. These large enterprises often anchor on one hyperscale provider. With this stage's move to the cloud, the need for services to unify the experience, configuration, and governance of cloud plus on-premise is becoming a must. Microsoft released [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/) last year to address this need while Amazon released [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/) this year for the same reason. In order to be the de-facto cloud provider for enterprises, tools to provide a consistent hybrid experience are essential.

When it comes to multi-cloud, cloud-native technologies are often part of the discussion. Many of the cloud-native technologies have multi-cloud support and flexibility as a selling point for their adoption. But, increasingly, cloud customers are choosing hyperscale provider managed services of these cloud-native technologies over the complexity of running the cloud-native technologies themselves. Kubernetes is an informative example of this as the popularity of managed Kubernetes offerings from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google take off. What we will see in 2019 is more on-premise offerings for these cloud native technologies, similar to [GKE On-Prem](https://cloud.google.com/gke-on-prem/), that enable a unified hybrid cloud experience with cloud-native technologies.

As the hyperscale providers launch new services to optimize the hybrid-cloud experience, hyperscale partners will start to launch similar services. Many hyperscale partners have positioned themselves as multi-cloud but I think 2019 is when those same vendors, and a crop of new vendors, will start to offer solutions and services for hybrid-cloud customers. 2019 and 2020 will be years marked by the hybrid-cloud opportunity and solutions.

What does this mean for cloud customers, especially large enterprises with established on-premise infrastructure that will represent the largest areas of cloud growth over the next 5-10 years? As our understanding of how to use the cloud has evolved and we have started to understand the realities of multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud, the future is starting to align with what large enterprises need in order to adopt the cloud en masse. Wading through the countless number of managed service offerings from hyperscale providers and their partners, enterprises have to anchor on one provider and they are going to need that hyperscale provider, and its partners, to unify the hybrid-cloud experience.

The pace at which EHRs are being [unbundled](https://datica.com/blog/ehrs-in-a-mobile-first-world/) has accelerated over that time period, but noticeably more so over the past 12-18 months. We have directly observed through our work with customers the uptick in EHR integration today compared to a few years ago, and how much more aggressively clinical data is desired for both data-driven analytics and powering new workflows. *The growth is fueled by the concept of adding “patient context” to digital products.*</div></pre><br/><pre><div markdown="0">There is a dichotomy in the market between approaches to adding patient context, based on our observations. 

On one side, there are companies that have developed technology only for healthcare users. These companies have healthcare as “a part of their DNA,” including the makeup of their teams. Many of these companies have grown, or at least survived, in the market without relying on EHR integration for adoption. A simple way to scope this segment is to look at digital health companies founded “pre-public-cloud” circa 2005-2012 who are still in business. They got to their zenith by delivering value to the system, and probably finding a way to catch the Meaningful Use wave. Many of them did not integrate with EHRs at all, period, but instead found workarounds. But as of 2018, they are now *all* looking to add real-time EHR integration to increase their value, boost their stickiness, add new features, or improve user engagement metrics.

On the other side, there are companies that have developed general purpose technologies that are now trying to sell those technologies into healthcare. The largest example of this category from a few years ago was Salesforce or Redhat. Today, you can add Google, Microsoft, Tableau, AWS, Splunk, VMware, and a host of others. If you were at HIMSS last week, you could appreciate the gravity of this shift by the booth sizes of these technology companies. The solutions fall into categories like cloud platforms, productivity, CRMs, analytics / BI, and communications. As it relates to the point about adding patient context, all these new entrants have understood from the get-go that clinical data improves their product value, product stickiness, and ROI.

For many of the healthcare-only companies we work with, they have spent years building relationships and gaining traction in healthcare. They have done this without EHR integration. But, as health systems start to accept the fact that their EHR vendor is not going to be able to offer solutions across all these product categories, and as more EHR data has started to flow out of the EHR, new opportunities are opening up for general technologies to scale into healthcare-now.

The core difference in the five-year period between 2019 and 2014, or even more recently between 2019 and 2017, is that EHR integration is simply becoming table stakes for digital health. This is a sea change that cannot be overstated. Only a few years ago when EHRs held the monopoly on strategic decision making at the CIO level, creatively designing a product that delivered value while avoiding the blocker of EHR integration was a key to success. Now, with EHR integration as table stakes, the key to success is leveraging EHR integration into an asset or differentiation. EHR integration and patient context opens the door for healthcare-specific features to be added to almost any technology.

This new world has leveled the playing field between healthcare-only digital health vendors and healthcare-now enterprise solutions. Healthcare-only companies have the advantage of existing relationships while healthcare-now companies bring scale that is not possible with healthcare-only. It will be interesting to see how this works out. Some of the largest companies in the world have the healthcare industry in their sights. Both categories will likely battle each other, and we think the winner will probably be the ones that are better at interoperating with clinical data in the EHR.</div></pre><br/><pre><div markdown="0">[datica.com/blog/the-patient-context-war-healthcare-only-versus-healthcare-now](https://datica.com/blog/the-patient-context-war-healthcare-only-versus-healthcare-now)</div></pre><br/></article></section></header></body></html>
